At its essence, Republican opposition to Obamacare derives from a philosophical resistance to being compelled to do anything that benefits others. This radical individualism is not only fundamentally antithetical to traditional conservatism but to the very principles from which our nation was forged in the first place.\n\nObamacare represents an \u201cassault on individual liberty,\u201d asserts Peter Berkowitz of the Hoover Institution. The Wall Street Journal argues that the Obama administration\u2019s assertion of power under the Affordable Care Act \u201cchange the structure of the American government as it has existed for 225 years\u201d to an extent that \u201cendangers individual liberty.\u201d In a blog post for the Heritage Foundation\u2014the conservative think tank that originated the policy ideas at the center of Obamacare\u2014Chris Jacobs says Obamacare \u201cundermines American values\u201d.\n\nPut aside, for a second, the fact that Obamacare is essentially a system for strengthening individual access to private insurance options within the free market. Even put aside, if you can, the fact that not only the Heritage Foundation but Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole, Mitt Romney, John McCain and a host of other Republicans embraced the individual mandate in the past. Conservatives now say they object to the idea that, for the sake of improving health care access and outcomes for everyone and lowering costs as well, anyone should be compelled to purchase health insurance\u2014let alone that such insurance should meet basic standards and include universal preventative care. The government making people buy health insurance, or otherwise face a penalty, is an \u201cunconstitutional violation of personal liberty and strikes at the heart of American federalism\u201d (again, says the Heritage Foundation).\n\nGovernment regulations were not anathema to the market but requisite.\n\nIn a perfect world, there would be a version of PolitiFact run by our nation\u2019s Founding Fathers and other traditionally celebrated conservative thinkers, serving as a giant rhetorical ruler with which to slap the wrist of modern conservatives who try to cloak their paranoid anti-government extremism in the conveniently revised avatars of their ancestors.\n\n\u201cIf a majority are capable of preferring their own private interest, or that of their families, counties, and party, to that of the nation collectively, some provision must be made in the constitution, in favor of justice, to compel all to respect the common right, the public good, the universal law, in preference to all private and partial considerations.\u201d This was written in 1787 by John Adams, who conservative intellectual Russell Kirk declared the most legitimate conservative thinker among the Founding Fathers. Guarding against the dangers of raw, unchecked individualism, the government can and must compel its citizens to protect the common good.\n\nAdam Smith, godfather of modern capitalism, agreed. Smith made clear that civil societies with laws and governments were necessary to create the pre-conditions for free markets. Government regulations were not anathema to the market but requisite.\n\nAnd Thomas Jefferson, writing in 1782, agreed: \u201cIt will be said that great societies cannot exist without government.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution of the United States of America begins by stating we formed our great nation to \u201cestablish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty.\u201d This is not an assertion of radical individualism but rather based on the embrace of mutual association, of the idea that together we can do more than we can do alone, the very principles of nationhood.\n\nIn the Federalist Papers, James Madison wrote, \u201cIf men were angels, no government would be necessary.\u201d In a nation\u2014in our nation\u2014the whole point is to balance individual self-interest with the common good. Doing so is not antithetical to our nation\u2019s values but, in fact, the entire reason our nation was created in the first place. And believing that as Americans we all have a duty to do things that benefit our fellow citizens and our nation as a whole, isn\u2019t just supporting President Obama and Obamacare. It\u2019s also called patriotism.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:08.182+0000"}

And so far, all he is getting for his trouble is charges of flip-flopping.\n\nIs there any recent precedent for a reluctant but strong warrior in Republican politics? Paul has been citing Ronald Reagan, but there is another, and perhaps more surprising, model: Ron Paul, the Kentucky senator\u2019s own father.\n\nThis may seem counterintuitive. While the elder Paul\u2019s two Republican presidential campaigns put noninterventionism back on the political map, his rhetoric is often a textbook example of how not to sell such foreign-policy ideas to the wider GOP base.\n\nRon Paul\u2019s first stints as a Republican congressman from Texas were during the 1970s and \u201880s, however. As a libertarian-leaning lawmaker, he frequently disagreed with his GOP colleagues on foreign policy back then too. But, unlike some more militant libertarian thinkers, Ron Paul never dismissed the threat of communism during the Cold War.\n\nIn 1976, Paul marked the death of Mao Tse-tung by taking to the House floor to denounce the \u201cvirtual censorship in America about the true facts regarding oppression in Communist China.\u201d Those facts, Paul said, indicated that Chairman Mao was a tyrannical monster whose people lived \u201cin abject slavery.\u201d\n\nPaul said it was \u201cfoolish to believe that the Chinese people do not have the same yearning for freedom that we have,\u201d adding that the \u201cuntold thousands who have risked their lives to escape for the liberty of Hong Kong\u201d prove otherwise. And when it came to Communists, Ron Paul didn\u2019t have time for d\u00e9tente.\n\nPaul said it was \u201cfoolish to believe that the Chinese people do not have the same yearning for freedom that we have,\u201d adding that the \u201cuntold thousands who have risked their lives to escape for the liberty of Hong Kong\u201d prove otherwise.\n\n\u201cWe are asked to be \u2018realists\u2019 and overlook such unpleasantries because we need the support of Communist China as a balance to the growing military power of the Soviet Union,\u201d Paul said in the same 1976 remarks. He then praised the United States for rejecting such thinking in the past and \u201cestablishing a foreign policy that not only upholds American interests, but is moral as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a tradition that is as old as the country itself and which survives today, in spite of Henry Kissinger\u2019s efforts to destroy it,\u201d Paul thundered.\n\nRon Paul, sounding like a neocon? The Weekly Standard and Washington Free Beacon didn\u2019t exist in 1976, but maybe the great libertarian hope had been reading too much Commentary.\n\nExcept right after the Kissinger-bashing comes this. \u201cIt is unfortunate that our foreign policy has been so mismanaged that the American people seem to equate a moral foreign policy with an interventionist foreign policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe two are not at all synonymous.\u201d\n\nLater in his book Foreign Policy of Freedom, Ron Paul acknowledged this \u201cmay be more hawkish than I would be today, but we certainly have moral authority to state our position without violating the independence of others.\u201d\n\nRon Paul opposed the weapons-limiting SALT II treaty with the Soviets, arguing in a 1979 issue of his \u201cFreedom Report\u201d newsletter, \u201cthis would probably lead to permanent US weakness and the make the Soviet Union the undisputed military superpower in the world.\u201d He added, \u201cIt would be profoundly destabilizing; and far from promoting peace, it would endanger it.\u201d Paul complained that for more than a decade prior to the treaty \u201cthe Soviet Union has outspent us on military offense and defense by 35% to 40%.\u201d This is at least as hawkish as anything Rand Paul has ever said about Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan invaded Grenada in 1983, Ron Paul sounded much like his son on Iraq and ISIS: skeptical both of intervention, especially if not done with congressional approval in accordance with the Constitution, and those who denied the U.S. had any national interest in Grenada.\n\n\u201cIt now appears that there were troops and advisers in Grenada from Libya, Cuba, Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, East Germany and North Korea,\u201d Paul said on the House floor in 1983. \u201cIf that is the case, I fail to see how anyone can believe that Grenada posed no threat to our well-being.\u201d He also acknowledged that \u201cwe have a legitimate national interest\u201d in Grenada.\n\nRon Paul supported Reagan on the Strategic Defense Initiative or \u201cStar Wars.\u201d In December 1983, he chastised those who said Reagan would be \u201cmilitarizing\u201d space. \u201cDespite the barrage of propaganda from the Kremlin\u2014propaganda that has been scandalously effective at influencing public opinion in the West\u2014space has already been \u2018militarized,\u2019\u201d he argued. \u201cAnd it is the Soviets that have been the \u2018militarizers.\u2019\u201d\n\nPaul continued to support missile defense as a Libertarian Party presidential candidate in 1988. \u201cI think that it\u2019s worth doing research on SDI, but I would take the money out of the money we spend overseas,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSeventy percent of our military money is spent overseas subsidizing rich allies that should be spent on the defense of this country, such as SDI.\u201d Years later, Rand Paul has emphasized missile defense to protect both U.S. and Israeli national security.\n\nUnlike John Kerry, Ron Paul opposed the nuclear freeze movement, a popular liberal demand to stop producing and deploying American strategic nuclear forces. He voted against a nuclear freeze resolution that passed the Democratic-controlled House in 1983.\n\n\u201cMy primary objection to a nuclear freeze treaty with the Soviet Union is that I am unwilling to trust the freedom and independence of the United States to the promises of the Soviet ruling elite,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe Soviets have broken almost every treaty they have ever signed, once it was no longer to their advantage to abide by its terms.\u201d\n\nRand Paul has frequently proposed cutting off foreign aid to hostile countries as a way to advance noninterventionism among more hawkish conservatives. His father did the same, condemning aid to the Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cThe Soviets get the goods,\u201d Ron Paul complained in 1980. \u201cThe big banks and companies get the profits. And the taxpayer gets the bill.\u201d\n\nThis Cold War Ron Paul hasn\u2019t shown up as much during the war on terror, though there have been occasional sightings. Paul voted for the resolution that authorized the invasion of Afghanistan. He justified his vote against the Iraq war by saying he didn\u2019t see an imminent terrorist threat from Baghdad.\n\n\u201cIf I were convinced of such a threat I would support going to war, as I did when I supported President Bush by voting to give him both the authority and the necessary funding to fight the war on terror,\u201d Paul explained.\n\nVery little of this history has been preserved, because it doesn\u2019t fit comfortably in either libertarian or neoconservative narratives. An exception is The New American, a magazine published by the John Birch Society, which (whatever else might be said about it) was simultaneously noninterventionist and anti-Communist.\n\nRon Paul was more dovish than most Republicans and more hawkish than some libertarians, but mostly preferred foreign aid cuts and missile defense to direct military interventions in foreign countries.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nW.

And this year, he\u2019s got his sights set on Bernie Sanders.\n\nManker, a Marine Corps veteran, co-founded the group Veterans for Bernie and said he\u2019s confident the Vermont senator will make it to the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cYou could say I\u2019ve got a pretty good history of picking the president, and my support is enthusiastically 100 percent behind Bernie Sanders,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect him to win the nomination.\u201d\n\nManker isn\u2019t alone. According to organizers, more than 150,000 people have RSVP\u2019d for house parties Wednesday evening to listen to a simulcast from the Democratic presidential candidate and coordinate their volunteer efforts. And what Sanders lacks in funds\u2014he raised about $15.2 million this quarter, while Hillary Clinton raked in more than three times that figure\u2014he may make up in true believers with experience in grassroots organizing. This is not a fluke; some of the most dogged pro-Bernie volunteers are alums of the Occupy movement, where they honed their activism skills.\n\n\u201cThe graduates of Occupy are now skilled organizers,\u201d said Katherine Brezler, a Yonkers schoolteacher and national digital organizer at People for Bernie.\n\nShe said some of the core organizers at People For Bernie\u2014a grassroots group unaffiliated with Sanders\u2019s campaign that works to mobilize Sanders volunteers\u2014first met in Zuccotti Park during the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protests.\n\n\u201cAfter Occupy, people didn\u2019t just go and sit in a hole,\u201d Brezler said. \u201cAfter Occupy, people became very involved in their communities and broadened their skill sets, broadened their networks, and now are revisiting a new campaign with revived interest in electoral politics because the candidate is speaking the language of their issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, Hillary supporters will be Bernie supporters after the primary.\u201d\n\nThere are numerous constituency groups in the People For Bernie family, said organizer Stan Williams. They range from those representing essential constituencies\u2014including Women for Bernie, African Americans for Bernie, and Labor for Bernie\u2014to slightly more niche groups (the Deadheads for Bernie Facebook page had 1,308 likes at press time). And they relish their independence from the official campaign.\n\n\u201cYou could write terrible things about me and no one\u2019s going to care because I\u2019m not Bernie,\u201d said Charles Lenchner, one of the co-founders of People For Bernie. \u201cWe\u2019re free. We use that freedom to do what we can.\u201d\n\nThat includes curating social media content, training constituency groups, helping smaller organizations write press releases, and generally cheerleading pro-Bernie efforts around the country. They also reach out to some constituencies where Sanders has struggled\u2014especially African-American voters. Nadya Stevens, who works with African Americans for Bernie, said her group is angling to increase Sanders\u2019s name ID among black voters while reminding them of the damage that Bill Clinton\u2019s tough-on-crime policies incurred.\n\n\u201cThe Clinton administration\u2014and that includes Hillary\u2014did some terrible things that adversely impacted the black community,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that she thinks Bill Clinton recently apologized to the NAACP for that legislation because it was the politically expedient thing to do.\n\n\u201cI think that he\u2019s doing that for Hillary because Hillary\u2019s not going to do it herself,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for organizers\u2019 levels of confidence in the likelihood of a Sanders presidency? They vary.\n\n\u201cI have so little faith in the system to begin with,\u201d Lenchner said. \u201cI would just say that an election is an opportunity to organize, and the organizing that we\u2019re doing is likely to have an impact for years to come.\u201d\n\nBrezler, the Yonkers schoolteacher who said she spends 19 hours a day working on the pro-Bernie efforts because school is out, is more bullish.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about this possibility and I believe that we will win,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that volunteers are in for the long haul.\n\n\u201cWe also know that it\u2019s important to practice self-care and to encourage your teammates to go for a walk, and to check in and have a normal non-Bernie conversation from time to time with people,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, Hillary supporters will be Bernie supporters after the primary,\u201d she added.\n\nBut not all Sanders backers would jump to Team Clinton. Manker, an independent who voted for both Bush and Obama twice, said he would consider voting Republican again if Democrats nominate Clinton.\n\n\u201cI have yet to meet or speak with a single veteran or military person who supports Hillary Clinton for president,\u201d he said, adding that Clinton\u2019s false claims that she ran through sniper fire in Bosnia still anger veterans.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a minor deal,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat has not gone away.

Faith and history command us to abhor all violence. The question is not why am I against Israel\u2019s disproportionate violence. The question is: How can any faithful Jew defend it?\n\nI hate violence in general. I hate Hamas rockets being fired toward Israel as much as I hate Israeli missiles being fired at Gaza. I don\u2019t think I should have to state that but apparently I do, since every time I critique Israel\u2019s military actions, I\u2019m accused of supporting Hamas. I hate Hamas. Hamas is a vile organization that manipulates and harms the Palestinian people instead of helping them. But I can be against Hamas and support the state of Israel while simultaneously critiquing Israel\u2019s attacks on civilians in Gaza.\n\nI admit that I\u2019m about as much of a theologian as I am an Orthodox Jew, which is to say not much of either. I could cite quotes from the Torah to point to the inherent peaceful, anti-violent nature of Judaism\u2014say, the Jewish tenets of war, which put the highest value on peace and protecting the innocent. But Judaism has always been to me what Israel is as well, an idea not merely inscribed books or carved out of geography but embodied in the values of its believers\u2014and thus only as good or bad as the lives we breathe into it. I was raised in a fairly anti-religion family so the extent to which I embrace or distance myself from my faith isn\u2019t an act of reflex but choice. I choose Judaism to the extent I feel it is a force for good and justice in the world.\n\nWhich, historically, it has been. Jews have often stood on the righteous side of history\u2014against genocide and for human rights and civil rights and equality for all. In the United States alone there is a long and proud tradition of Jewish activists standing up for peace and justice. That tradition here and elsewhere stands in contrast to and defiance of the ugly past, when our ancestors were subject to the consequences of unthinkable hatred and discrimination. Out of the ashes of the Holocaust, I always thought of us Jews not only as a reminder for how horrid inhumanity could be, but also as a beacon for precisely the opposite\u2014not only a warning to the world but, just as much, an example.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s not what Judaism means to everyone. That\u2019s what it means to me.\n\nWhich is precisely why it\u2019s so troubling that a nation founded as a haven for the people of my faith is killing so many Palestinians. According to the latest United Nations figures, at least 121 Palestinian children under the age of 18 have been killed since July 8\u2014roughly one-third of all Palestinian civilian casualties. Last week, four Palestinian children were killed by Israeli missiles while they were playing on a beach. This week, 25 people\u2014including 19 children\u2014were killed by Israeli missiles as they were sitting down to dinner to break the Ramadan fast. Yes, Hamas is firing rockets from residential areas and storing weapons caches in schools. But it\u2019s also true that Israel bombed the only recovery hospital in Gaza. One side\u2019s wrongs don\u2019t make the other side\u2019s actions any more right. How could any parent, any human being, let alone any Jew, hear story after story of death and destruction in Gaza and not be wrenched with sadness?\n\nWhatever you think about the motivations or justifications of the state of Israel and its actions, the Palestinian people are undeniably politically, economically, and culturally oppressed.\n\nFor nearly 50 years now, or almost three-quarters of its own existence as a state, Israelis have occupied Palestinian territories in the name of forming a Jewish state. That makes Israel one of the longest-standing colonial powers in modern history. And in recent years the occupation of Gaza in particular has been increasingly harsh, shutting off the region from important resources and economic opportunity. In this context, while I embrace the idea of Israel, I\u2019m deeply conflicted when the actualization of the idea of Jewish liberation seems to go hand-in-hand with the oppression of others. And yes, whatever you think about the motivations or justifications of the state of Israel and its actions, the Palestinian people are undeniably politically, economically, and culturally oppressed.\n\nIt was Rabbi Hillel, considered one of the most important leaders in Jewish history, who said, \u201cDo not do to others what you would not have them do to you.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is the whole of the Torah, and the rest is commentary; go learn it.\u201d Hillel\u2019s key lesson, what we today call The Golden Rule, was inscribed on a portrait that hung in my living room as a child. In the picture was a rabbi and, painted standing beside him, people from all over the world. When I think of Judaism, I think of that picture\u2014which reminds me to treat my fellow human beings with compassion no matter what.\n\nUltimately in this conflict, history will reward not the side that struck the first blow but the side that first stopped striking. In the meantime, at the very, very least, the blows could be less severe. And those severe blows are mostly being lobbed by the far more powerful and capable Israeli military.\n\nIf faith is the belief in a power greater than ourselves as human beings, then my faith derives from a belief that there is a power to be kind and understanding and generous and, yes, to love thy neighbor\u2014a faith that the Holocaust will never happen again and nor will anything echoing such dehumanization and destruction. Believing that peace is both good and possible, believing that our respect for humanity can triumph over our urge toward violence, does not mean I\u2019m a terrorist sympathizer or na\u00efve or anything in between. As far as I\u2019m concerned, it just means I\u2019m Jewish.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:11.090+0000"}

In fact, support for Obamacare and same-sex marriage are now at record highs.\n\nToday, CNN/ORC International released a new poll conducted May 29-31 on the key issues on which the Supreme Court will rule this month, including marriage, Obamacare, voting rights, and free speech. The results are surprising.\n\nRegarding the Affordable Care Act, 43% of respondents said they \u201cgenerally favor\u201d the legislation. That, itself, is the highest favorable rating since the poll began asking the question in March 2010, when the ACA was passed.\n\nBut of the 55% who said they oppose the ACA (interestingly, only 2% had no opinion), 15% oppose the law because it is \u201cnot liberal enough.\u201d These 15% are the Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren voters who inhabit my favorite coffee shops in Brooklyn. They\u2019re the ones who pushed for a single payer system, or who view the ACA as a giveaway to insurance companies (which, given that it was a Republican idea, it sort of is).\n\nAdd the favorables and the not-liberal-enoughs together, and you\u2019ve got 58% who favor Obamacare, or something (even?) more liberal. That, too, is a record.\n\nDoubtless, the record high numbers for Obamacare reflect that the law appears to be working. That also accounts for the GOP\u2019s relative silence on the issue, despite its being formally on the agenda of every Republican presidential candidate, and still the subject of obsession at conservative think tanks.\n\nIncidentally, support for the ACA varied widely on racial lines, with 49% of white respondents saying the law was good or not liberal enough, compared with 74% of non-white respondents.\n\nOther than Obamacare, the highest-profile issue remaining on the court\u2019s docket is that of same-sex marriage. Here, 63% of respondents said that \u201cgays and lesbians\u2026 have a constitutional right to get married and have their marriage recognized by law.\u201d\n\nThat number is essentially flat from the last time the question was asked, in February. It reflects a 14 percentage-point jump from five years ago. And while far more Democrats than Republicans support same-sex marriage, both numbers have increased: 35% for Republicans (up from 27% in 2010) and 74% of Democrats (up from 56% in 2010).\n\nHere, however, Republican presidential hopefuls are tripping over themselves to buck the national trend. Most recently, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said Sunday that he favors a constitutional amendment allowing states to ban gay marriage.\n\nNo one except Lincoln Chafee and George Pataki thinks you can win the Republican presidential nomination by running to the center, and no one except their wives thinks they have a chance of winning it.\n\nWhy the disconnect? Primary politics, of course. No one except Lincoln Chafee and George Pataki thinks you can win the Republican presidential nomination by running to the center, and no one except their wives thinks they have a chance of winning it. To turn out the base, you\u2019ve got to be against the gays.\n\nThe question is whether these disconnects between public opinion and GOP dogma will matter.\n\nLiberals hope, of course, that these positions come back to haunt the GOP come fall 2016. But there is good reason to be skeptical. Not only have presidential candidates always flip-flopped between April and October, it\u2019s hard to envision many swing voters making a candidate\u2019s stance on marriage or Obamacare the one issue that tips the balance toward Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe new numbers help fill out the picture. On Obamacare, 29% of Republicans and 55% of Independents said that they favor the law, or that it\u2019s not liberal enough. (Note to the 17% of Republicans who said it\u2019s not liberal enough: You are confused.) But do any of them feel so strongly about the issue that it will meaningfully affect their vote? We don\u2019t know.\n\nMarriage might be different: 35% of Republicans and 69% of Independents say gays have a right to marry. The contrary numbers are somewhat higher than those on Obamacare, but more importantly, marriage could become a defining issue in the way that Obamacare is not. It\u2019s a cultural barometer, and a fast-moving target. Hardcore opposition may make a Candidate Walker or Bush seem prejudiced, or out of touch, or too socially conservative.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true given the wingnuts who will likely take to the streets after a Supreme Court ruling. Every time someone makes a reasonable case for traditional marriage, some moron makes a Neanderthal one\u2014like the Westboro Baptist Church taking on Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling this past week.\n\nOf course, there are wingnuts against Obamacare too. But opposition to Obamacare isn\u2019t really a moral issue except for those already on the fringes, and it\u2019s easy to distinguish a principled disagreement about the size of government from a ludicrous Tea Party conspiracy theory.\n\nBut on marriage, the gap between the Republican base and the American voter is growing, and the Christian Right is starting to look mean.\n\nFinally, one might wonder: If there\u2019s a near two-thirds liberal supermajority on these key political bellwethers, why is the House so firmly in the hands of the one-third minority?\n\nUnfortunately, the answer to that question lies far from high-wattage Supreme Court cases, and in the haze of voter suppression, gerrymandering, and the enormously successful REDMAP project to create Republican congressional districts any which way but loose. These are the factors that have created a Congress that looks and votes so unlike America, but they\u2019re also issues that make most voters\u2019 eyes glaze over.\n\nMaybe one day, the disconnect will cause some of them to open.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:11.243+0000"}

In the 2006 midterm sweep that tossed out Republicans from New Jersey to Maine, Democrats took 10 congressional seats, two Senate seats, and two governorships held by the GOP. The next election, those gains were further consolidated, as Democrats swept out another half-dozen House Republicans and a senator.\n\nAnd even in what was an otherwise dreary year for Democrats in 2010, the Northeast provided some kind of ballast, with the biggest Republican gains coming in the Midwest and Mountain states.\n\nBut now, at last, the Northeast Republican looks set to rise again. Polls show that in Maine, Tea Party Gov. Paul LePage is poised to win reelection in a three-way contest. In Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, who lost his first bid for governor four years ago, is expected to dispatch Attorney General Martha Coakley. In Rhode Island and Connecticut, polls are deadlocked.\n\nMeanwhile, Scott Brown, who with his surprise 2010 victory over Coakley for a Senate seat in Massachusetts helped set the stage for this Republican resurgence, looks as if he has an even chance of besting incumbent New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. And Republicans appear likely to win another handful of congressional seats, including as many as three in New York City and its surrounding suburbs. Even in Washington, D.C, that border town with Southern efficiency and Northern charm, a Republican mayoral candidate looks set to put together a respectable performance.\n\nRepublican political operatives say the gains the GOP is set to make are due to a convergence of causes. There is the fact that in the wave election year that 2014 seems poised to become, the party could win in even the most unexpected of places. There is the fact that in many of these states Democratic legislatures are entrenched, and voters are looking for a counterweight.\n\nAnd finally, there is the fact that most of the culture wars have reached a stalemate. In Massachusetts, for example, Baker is running as a pro-choice, pro same-sex marriage Republican nominee. Other Republicans are similarly downplaying these hot-button issues of old, and pollsters say most voters see them now as settled matters. And so if two candidates are a wash on matters of civil rights, why not go for the guy who is going to cut your taxes?\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of Democrats to elect a Republican in one of these places,\u201d said John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster. \u201cYou can\u2019t win otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublicans have just been putting together a more coherent message of change in New England,\u201d said Will Ritter, a Republican political operative who worked on a number of statewide races in Massachusetts. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 message is what\u2014\u2018Hey, it is not so bad?\u2019 People look to candidates who have a business background, or at least have conservative underpinnings, when it looks like budgets are going off the rails.\u201d\n\nThe major question for the Republican Party going forward is what all these Yankee newcomers will mean for its direction. The GOP has been at odds with itself as it tries to decide how to appeal to a diverse and changing electorate, and some Republicans think a handful of new voices from states not necessarily of the reddest hue could help the eventual 2016 presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of Democrats to elect a Republican in one of these places,\u201d said John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster. \u201cYou can\u2019t win otherwise.

{"entityId": 1483, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "There\u2019s a weird war happening on Southern freeways. Evangelicals and atheists are taking up dueling billboard space, leaving us wondering: what\u2019s the point?\n\nFor those who live in the American South, the news that white supremacist billboards are appearing in and near Birmingham, Alabama does not come as a surprise. Last summer, a billboard reading \u201cAnti-Racist is a Code Word for Anti-White\u201d appeared on I-20. Earlier this month, another on I-59 warned that \u201cDiversity Means Chasing Down the Last White Person.\u201d The secessionist group League of the South claimed to have made the former, and the latter, owned by a private citizen, appears to take its talking points from the white supremacist White Genocide Project. But alarming as these billboards may be, they are, unfortunately, par for the course below the Mason-Dixon line.\n\nI didn\u2019t pay much attention to Interstate scenery myself until I moved to the South five years ago. Now, it\u2019s hard to keep my eyes off the roadside. Not only are there countless cars bearing Confederate bumper stickers, there are also prominent Confederate flags flying over I-75, one north of Tifton, Georgia, another just outside of Tampa, and others scattered throughout the region. Alongside I-95 on the way into North Carolina, there are dozens of billboards featuring a racist caricature of a sombrero-wearing Mexican named Pedro, who urges me to stop at the infamous eyesore of a tourist trap known as South of the Border. One of these billboards features a large three-dimensional sausage and promises, \u201cYou\u2019re always a wiener at Pedro\u2019s.\u201d\n\nIf I drive west on I-40, I will eventually pass a 19-story tall cross outside of Amarillo, Texas because apparently some local Christians interpreted \u201cEverything\u2019s bigger in Texas\u201d as a commandment rather than a cute regional saying. And wherever I roam in the South, doomsday proclamations and manipulative anti-abortion messages about fetal heartbeats are so commonplace that they barely register anymore. The \u201cI\u2019ll Be Back\u201d billboards, however, are particularly arresting. My favorite\u2014if I can call it that\u2014is an absurd, poorly Photoshopped m\u00e9lange of Jesus, troops, tanks, and helicopters below the emblazoned reminder \u201cI\u2019m Still in Control,\u201d with an explosion in the background completing the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne.\n\nWhen an average road trip in the South involves driving past plantation gift shops behind a truck with a birther bumper sticker, a billboard that explicitly endorses white supremacy is really just filling in the blanks.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, white supremacist billboards don\u2019t stick out in the South\u2014they fit right in. Local leaders in Alabama can denounce the billboards all they like, but paranoid predictions of white genocide are a logical addition to the tapestry of ideologies that is already on display on Southern highways. When an average road trip in the South involves driving past plantation gift shops behind a truck with a birther bumper sticker, a billboard that explicitly endorses white supremacy is really just filling in the blanks. The Southern Interstates have one and only one redeeming sight: the \u201cPeachoid\u201d along I-85 in Gaffney, South Carolina, which got its well-deserved 15 minutes of fame in an episode of House of Cards. But peach-shaped water tower aside, what is going on down here, y\u2019all?\n\nIn the South, rural billboards have become a bizarre battleground for tired culture wars. Roadside attractions act as towering testaments to the ideologies that once shaped the U.S. even more overtly than they do now: Christianity, sexism, and down-home racism. To be sure, fundamentalist and anti-abortion billboards can be found in most swaths of rural America. There\u2019s even a giant cross in Illinois at the intersection of I-70 and I-57 that\u2019s taller than the one in Texas. But I\u2019ve driven through almost every state but the Dakotas and trust me, nothing compares to the South\u2019s combination of cultural conservatism and lingering Confederate presence. The South is where the irrepressible subconscious of white America waves to you from the side of the road.\n\nBut why does it manifest itself in the form of billboards, flags, and crosses? And why is the roadside such prime real estate for incendiary rhetoric in the first place? Billboards remain relatively effective forms of commercial advertising in cities with a large commuter presence but billboards with social messages are not advertising a product, nor are they typically placed in urban areas where ad space would be more expensive. Driving past a loud billboard in the middle of nowhere feels a little bit like watching someone shout impotently into the void. As for flags and crosses, well, they\u2019re just sort of there, aren\u2019t they? What is anyone who rents a cheap billboard or who snatches up land on an access road hoping to accomplish?\n\nI can think of a no more useless pissing match than one between fundamentalist Christians and atheists that takes place on bargain basement billboards in the backwoods of America.\n\n\n\nThe driving factor behind these ads, flags, and attractions seems to be the simple urge to be seen. The Southern Party of Georgia, for example, brags that the Confederate flag outside Tifton is \u201chighly visible to traffic from both directions.\u201d The Sons of Confederate Veterans similarly note that the flag has been \u201cstrategically placed\u201d so that it can \u201cbe easily seen by the millions who travel Georgia\u2019s main interstate back and forth to Florida.\u201d Cross Ministries, the church affiliated with the Texas cross, claims that \u201c10 million people pass by [the cross] every year\u201d and that it \u201ccan be seen from 20 miles away.\u201d The farmer and welder who bought the land for the Confederate flag outside of Tampa was looking for a \u201chigh-profile site\u201d that he could still afford. But these roadside sights are nothing more than last-gasp bids for cultural relevance in a world that is, quite literally, passing them by. The people who buy them are playing a no-stakes game of \u201cmade you look\u201d with a dogmatic twist.\n\nAnd while this dogmatic twist is most often a conservative one, atheists are now entering the Southern billboard wars. Last month, the American Atheists organization developed a billboard campaign for Bible Belt cities like Memphis, Nashville, and St. Louis that shows a young girl writing to Santa Claus, asking him to allow her to \u201cskip church\u201d for Christmas. And an atheist coalition in Mississippi just placed an expensive billboard on I-10 in Jackson country that reads, \u201cDon\u2019t believe in God? You\u2019re not alone.\u201d While atheists are definitely the underdog in this turf war\u2014a Pew study found that atheists are the least-liked religious group in the U.S. second only to Muslims\u2014the tactic of erecting a billboard is still an asinine one. I can think of a no more useless pissing match than one between fundamentalist Christians and atheists that takes place on bargain basement billboards in the backwoods of America.\n\nThe rural Southern political billboard is truly the dick pic of the Interstate, a surefire way to force others to witness your own self-satisfaction but an ineffective way to accomplish anything other than that. These billboards and roadside displays aren\u2019t a form of rhetoric so much as they are what Walt Whitman might call \u201cbarbaric yawps,\u201d inchoate assertions of presence in the wilderness. They are bumper stickers for people who don\u2019t feel like bumper stickers are big enough. But as futile as these roadside displays may be, they do have cultural consequences. For non-white Alabamans, white supremacist billboards are a reminder that they live among people who perceive them as a threat. For black travelers on the Interstate, a Confederate flag evokes an all-too-recent history that many white Southerners still wish was their present. And when I drove past South of the Border with a Latina friend, her discomfort was much more palpable than my own.\n\nBut the fact that the dying gasp of fundamentalists, secessionists, and supremacists is taking place along the Interstate, of all places, is perhaps a heartening sign. These groups are much more adept at buying useless physical ad space then they are at, say, influencing public opinion on a platform like Twitter, although the most recent Alabama billboard tried to start the hashtag #WhiteGenocide. With social conservatism on a downward trend across every generation of Americans and faith in God plummeting among those born after 1981, these roadside displays come across more like death throes than they do as declarations of faith or confident warnings of the apocalypse. You can put a fundamentalist Jesus on a big poster with guns and tanks and claim that he\u2019s still in control but that doesn\u2019t make it true. And sure, you can paint a message about the impending white genocide on an Alabama billboard, but you\u2019d only be hanging your own cultural irrelevance out to dry.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:11.684+0000"}

Can this ever change? Not likely.\n\nSo who wants to take a stab at explaining why Barack Obama couldn\u2019t adjust his schedule to attend a massive march in Paris dedicated to the values of the Enlightenment, but somehow did manage to find a way to make exactly such a schedule change to pay his respects to a regime that is one of the most implacable foes of Enlightenment to be found on our morally creaky little planet?\n\nFor the trip he did make, to Saudi Arabia yesterday, he not only managed a schedule change but miraculously enough, the last-minute schedules of roughly 30 very important people\u2014James Baker, Condi Rice, Susan Rice, John Kerry, Nancy Pelosi, John Brennan, John McCain\u2014who accompanied the president to Riyadh, were also changed.\n\nNow to be sure, I wrote that Obama should not have gone to Paris for security reasons. But I did say he should have sent his whole Cabinet. It\u2019s apparently not so much that that couldn\u2019t have been put together as it is that no one bothered to think of it. But when a Saudi king dies, by God, the White House pulls out all the stops and thinks of everything.\n\nIt was just a bit stomach-turning, wasn\u2019t it, to watch Obama drop everything and go genuflect to these superannuated reactionaries who refuse to shake his wife\u2019s hand. Ditto the experience of hearing his rather flaccid rationale for evidently not raising with his new highness, King Salman, either human rights generally or the case of blogger Raif Badawi specifically, which I wrote about two weeks ago. Such discussion, the president told Fareed Zakaria, \u201cmakes some of our allies uncomfortable. It makes them frustrated. And you know, some of them listen and some don\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s pretty clear which category the Saudis fall in.\n\nIt\u2019s an awful regime. And lots of Americans, especially people on the left, say we should have nothing to do with it. But the world of foreign-policy making, especially in the Middle East, doesn\u2019t leave much room for choices based on morality. There are two sides in the Middle East when you get right down to it. One side is Iran, Russia, Syria, and Hezbollah (and also, although in a different way, the Muslim Brotherhood). The other consists of various Sunni regimes and movements, some really radical and some merely run-of-the-mill radical, led by Saudi Arabia. And there\u2019s no way not to choose.\n\nPeople think the Saudi relationship is all about oil, and of course, that\u2019s the historical basis of it all. Oil is still a big factor, but these days our dependence on Saudi oil has lessened while the crises that demand our attention have increased. If the United States absents itself from the region, it simply leaves a vacuum that will be filled by far more malign actors than us.\n\nSo we have to choose. And we\u2019re certainly not going to choose Iran. Or\u2026 are we? I confess to wondering why Obama seems so set on getting this nuclear deal with Iran. I\u2019m confused about what it\u2019s supposed to accomplish. To ensure that Iran will use nuclear power only for peaceful purposes? You don\u2019t have to be an Obama-hater to be skeptical of that idea. To bring Iran into the family of respectable nations? It\u2019s going to need a lot more than this deal for that to happen. The best explanation is that the negotiations are essentially defensive\u2014that is, if we weren\u2019t negotiating with the Iranians, they\u2019d just go off and develop the capacity without any global input or oversight, and eventually they\u2019d have a nice little arsenal on their hands; and someday they\u2019d even smuggle one or two warheads over to Lebanon. Hezbollah and Israel staring each other down with nuclear weapons on their backs is pretty much the single last thing the world needs. So Obama and his people feel that a deal is the best chance for peace in our time.\n\nAll right, that makes sense. But in the meantime, Obama\u2019s determination to consummate this deal has already been costly. It\u2019s basically the reason the administration vacillated for so long on helping the Syrian rebels, and why it still gets all contorted on the question of whether Bashar al-Assad\u2019s ouster is or is not U.S. policy. The Syria policy has cost the United States huge amounts of trust and good will among the kinds of people in the region we want to have good will with.\n\nBeyond a deal that\u2019s essentially defensive in nature, does Obama really aim more generally to tilt away from Saudi Arabia and toward Iran?\n\nBeyond a deal that\u2019s essentially defensive in nature, does Obama really aim more generally to tilt away from Saudi Arabia and toward Iran? Given that we\u2019ve been allies with the Saudis for 70-plus years and that Iran has been calling us the Great Satan for 35, that seems a nearly impossible maneuver to pull off. Especially at a time when we\u2019re asking Saudi Arabia to play a key, maybe the key, role in the fight (which one presumes is going to last for quite a while) against the Islamic State\u2014providing the facilities for the training of the moderate Syrian rebel fighters.\n\nThere\u2019s one more upcoming wildcard here, as my colleague Eleanor Clift reported recently. The next few months may see the release of the famously redacted 28 pages of the 9/11 commission report. What\u2019s apparently in those pages is evidence that will show how the Saudi government or elements within it provided a \u201cnetwork of support\u201d for the 9/11 hijackers. If those pages are as iron-clad and shocking as some people who\u2019ve seen them say they are, then Iran is probably going to start looking pretty good to most Americans by comparison.\n\nSo\u2026 talk about lesser-evilism. It\u2019s not every day I find myself on the same page as Max Boot, but he made a decent analogy yesterday when he wrote that choosing between the Saudis and the Iranians is like choosing between Hitler and Stalin in the 1930s. Boot says Iran is still Hitler, and we need to choose Stalin. I agree. Obama hauling 30 dignitaries over to Riyadh seems to indicate that he does, too, at least until the June deadline for the Iran talks.\n\nAll the choices are bad\u2014but we have to make them and hope for the best. Isolationists and moralists, whether on the right or the left, are fantasizing about a world that doesn\u2019t exist. Choosing among competing extremisms is going to be our reality for a good 20 years, seemingly. That may seem immoral. But trying to pretend they aren\u2019t there, and ceding the ground to others\u2014that\u2019s the real immoral choice.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:12.193+0000"}
{"entityId": 1485, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Yes, every Kansas senator since 1940 has been a Republican. But Pat Roberts is in trouble for the same reasons incumbents usually are.\n\nIn December 1930, in the depths of the Great Depression, Kansas voters chose Democrat George McGill to complete the unexpired Senate term of Charles Curtis, who\u2019d been elected as Herbert Hoover\u2019s vice president. Two years later, Kansas helped oust Curtis\u2014and Hoover\u2014by voting for Franklin Roosevelt and re-electing McGill. Six years later, after one more dance with FDR, Kansans returned to their normal political axis. They threw out McGill\u2014and haven\u2019t looked back since. No state\u2014not Utah, not Wyoming, not Idaho\u2014has gone nearly that long sending only Republicans to the Senate. (In presidential elections since \u201936, the state has gone Democratic exactly once\u2014LBJ in his 1964 landslide.)\n\nThat\u2019s why the national press has been flocking to the Sunflower State in numbers suggesting the appearance of an alien spacecraft. The state that has gone more than three-quarters of a century without ever defeating an elected GOP senator is seriously threatening the tenure of three-term Senator Pat Roberts. In the just-released USA Today/Suffolk poll, Roberts trails his opponent by five points. (By contrast, Roberts won re-election in 2008 by 24 points). To add to the \u201cHoly Smokes!\u201d quality of this election year, Republican Governor Sam Brownback, who won office four years ago by 31 points, trails his opponent by four points.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked longtime Kansas City Star reporter David Helling what he would have told someone who\u2019d predicted this development eight months ago, he said simply: \u201cthat they\u2019re smoking something that\u2019s legal in Colorado, but not in Kansas....All the statewide offices are Republicans. All four congressmen are Republicans. The party has had by and large hegemony in Kansas for decades.\u201d Outsiders\u2014myself included\u2014have taken to grasping for the set of familiar Kansas references to paint a picture of what\u2019s happening.\n\nIt\u2019s another \u201cbleeding Kansas,\u201d reaching back to the murderous battles in the years before the Civil War between those who wanted Kansas as a free state and those who wanted a slave state. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Kansas?\u201d we ask, harkening back to a famous editorial by Emporia Gazette editor William Allen White, or the more recent bestseller by Tom Frank. Or maybe we just exclaim in wonder: \u201cI have a feeling we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore.\u201d\n\nSo permit a bit of perspective: What\u2019s happening here is not all that bizarre. Pat Roberts is in trouble for the same reasons that have afflicted many other senators. At 78, Roberts has been a part of Washington for more than half his life\u2014he began as a staff aide in 1967, and won a House seat in 1980. He long held the title of the funniest man in the Senate\u2014Al Franken may have taken that away\u2014but he still does a more than passable Jack Benny imitation, and is startlingly familiar with the work of legendary radio comedians Bob and Ray.\n\nYou get a sense of how far back he goes when you ask him to describe himself. \u201cI would say probably an Eisenhower Republican,\u201d he told me, using a label that has likely not been heard for several decades. \u201cI know Bob Dole\u2014a dear friend\u2014so I\u2019m a Bob Dole Republican. But,\u201d he hastens to add, \u201cI\u2019m also the fourth-most conservative senator in the State. \u201c\n\n\n\nWhile Roberts narrowly survived a primary against a Tea Party foe, his rightward move alienated moderates like former Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum\u2014who refused to cut an ad for him.\n\nThat voting record is key: In a state that is often described as having both a \u201cmoderate\u201d and a \u201cconservative\u201d Republican Party, Roberts was target by the same Tea Party movement that took down Senate Republicans like Richard Lugar and Robert Bennett. While he narrowly survived a primary against a Tea Party foe, his rightward move alienated moderates like former Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum\u2014who refused to cut an ad for him.\n\nPerhaps more harmful was the charge that Roberts had \u201cgone Washington\u201d\u2014that he was too much a part of \u201cthe system,\u201d too far from his roots. It was an idea buttressed by a devastating New York Times piece last February revealing that Roberts had no home in Kansas\u2014that he rented a room in a condo on a golf course from supporters. He did not help his cause when he said on a radio show, \u201cEvery time I get an opponent\u2014I mean, a chance\u2014I come home to Kansas.\u201d\n\nA month or so ago it appeared that Roberts\u2019 best asset was the divided nature of his opposition; he faced both a Democrat and an independent, 45-year-old businessman and investor Greg Orman, with the wealth to fund his own campaign. Then Democrat Chad Taylor dropped out; and Orman took the chance to carefully separate himself from both major parties, whose approval ratings mirror that of Roger Goodell.\n\n\u201cI think both parties are really to blame for what\u2019s going on in Washington,\u201d Orman told me as he worked the Kansas State football crowd. \u201cBoth parties take extreme positions the way Harry Reid is running the Senate. He\u2019s running the Senate like a dictatorship. He\u2019s not allowing compromise, he\u2019s not allowing debate. We got the same problem in the House with the Republicans, so I think both parties are really to blame for the dysfunction that we have in Washington today. And if we don\u2019t do something different, if we don\u2019t fundamentally change Washington, we\u2019re not going to be able to solve problems, and that\u2019s going to be a real issue for the American people.\u201d\n\nWhat that \u201csomething different\u201d might be is not exactly clear. He is vague on what to do about the Keystone pipeline, what to do about Obamacare\u2014even what party he\u2019ll caucus with should he be the deciding vote on who controls the Senate. He treats it as a golden opportunity to flex Kansas\u2019 muscle.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he told me as I nabbed a couple minutes with him after a speech at a VFW, \u201cI think it's a wonderful opportunity for the voters of Kansas and what I've talked about is we will caucus with whichever party0will be willing to promote a pro-problem-solving, nonpartisan agenda.\u201d\n\nRoberts has staked his survival on branding Orman with the label most likely to unsettle undecided Kansans.\n\n\u201cHe is a liberal Democrat, and that's why you have Jeb Bush, John McCain, you have Rand Paul...I think about everybody in the party is coming\u2014conservative, I don\u2019t say moderate\u2014regular Republicans knowing how important this race is because they know Greg is a liberal Democrat.

{"entityId": 1486, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The ex-president\u2019s brother thinks he shouldn\u2019t have to address all the bloodshed his brother caused. Sorry, Jeb: That\u2019s insane.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to talk about the past either, if I were John Ellis Bush. I trust you caught that little moment last Friday, when he said, in response to questions about his \u201cmajor foreign policy speech\u201d coming this Wednesday, that running for president is not about \u201cre-litigating anything in the past.\u201d\n\nRight. As Daniel Larison pointed out, no one running for president should be allowed to get anywhere near the Oval Office without giving voters a very full understanding of their assessment of American foreign policy in these last tumultuous and sanguinary 15 years. But for someone named Bush, that goes triple. It would be like Bernie Madoff\u2019s brother trying to get a seat on the stock exchange while insisting that the past was irrelevant.\n\nAll right, Madoff is a bit of a stretch, I guess. But only a bit. We\u2014the United States of America, under George W. Bush and his lieutenants\u2014unleashed oceans of mayhem on the world, leading to many tens of thousands of deaths; leading to the rise of ISIS, which grew directly out of the failure of our favored government in Baghdad to deal reasonably with the Sunni population; and leading, finally, to some of the most shameful moments in modern American history (torture, black sites, and the rest). Gee, now that I put it that way, I think I actually insulted Madoff, who only stole money. The George W. Bush government did that too, in essence, with its $2 trillion, off-the-books war, on a scale Madoff could never have dreamed.\n\nNow, Jeb Bush is of course his own man and is not his brother. But by God you\u2019d better believe that voters have a right to know whether he thinks the wars his brother started were just, whether they were prosecuted intelligently or badly, what the particularly egregious errors were, and most of all what lessons he takes away from it all. Hillary Clinton is going to be asked, and asked, and rightly so, about her vote for the Iraq war. Jeb didn\u2019t cast any such vote, true. But at the same time, one doubts he sat around the Christmas dinner table in 2001 trying to persuade his brother that invading Iraq was a lousy idea.\n\nHe should not even be taken seriously on the subject of foreign policy if he doesn\u2019t address these matters. Since he says he\u2019s not going to in Wednesday\u2019s speech, so much for that. And anyway, everyone seems to have forgotten that he already gave a semi-major foreign policy speech barely more than two months ago, which you can watch here, before the Cuba Democracy PAC in Miami. The emotional points of the speech were 1) to demonstrate his fluency in Spanish and 2) to reiterate the reactionary position on Cuba that he\u2019s held for many long years, and which only a minority of even Cuban Americans share.\n\nOne doubts he sat around the Christmas dinner table in 2001 trying to persuade his brother that invading Iraq was a lousy idea.\n\nBut there were many other elements to it, notably his seven-point plan for how America can reclaim its rightful yada yada yada. And of course it was larded with rhetoric about Obama\u2019s weakness and America\u2019s alleged retrenchment under a president who\u2019s bombed at least as many countries as Dubya did. Jeb actually did make one good point, one totally fair criticism of Obama\u2014that words have to mean something. He cited the \u201cred line\u201d on Syrian chemical weapons. And I applaud him for saying that it\u2019s wrong for politicians to thunder about \u201ctaking out ISIS.\u201d I wrote a column last fall reproving Obama for that empty and counter-productive talk about \u201cdestroying\u201d ISIS, so I\u2019m with Jeb on that one, although he did not say in the Miami speech whether his criticism meant a) that we should be content to contain ISIS, if we can even do that, or b) we should send troops in and get into a real war. Perhaps he\u2019ll give a clue Wednesday.\n\nThe larger problem\u2014not so much for Bush as for those of us who might have to live under his presidency, both here and in the world\u2019s hot spots\u2014is this. Of course, Bush and all the rest of them have to bash Obama as weak and at the end of the day not really concerned with American strength and credibility since he is, as their base voters believe, not actually American. That\u2019s job number one for any Republican presidential candidate\u2014Obama is the devil. But then where do they go from there?\n\nWhere they go from there is to highly untenable destinations where most Americans have no desire to tread. Let me put it more bluntly: They go from there to greatly increasing the likelihood of more war, and this time with U.S. troops on the ground.\n\nTake the Islamic State as the most obvious example. All right, Obama\u2019s plan relies on a lot of what ifs. So what would they do that didn\u2019t rely on a lot of what ifs? Answer: nothing. Because it\u2019s impossible. The United States can\u2019t make Saudi Arabia or Iran or Turkey do anything. As Scott Walker discovered on TV a couple of Sundays ago, when ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz boxed him in, if you want to say Obama isn\u2019t doing enough, the only logical end point for you is to be willing to put U.S. troops on the ground.\n\nI mentioned Iran above. So speaking of Iran: All the Republicans scorn Obama\u2019s negotiating posture. Okay then. So\u2026what? You won\u2019t negotiate with Iran? How does that not mean that Iran will just develop a bomb anyway, but this time with utterly no chance of international supervision? How does that make anybody safer? Oh. You\u2019re going to prevent the Iranians from getting the bomb. I see. By doing what? By not being a secret Muslim like Obama? Sorry, that\u2019s not going to work. The only way is by being willing to start a war with them. The same goes for Putin in Ukraine. Nobody likes him, or what he\u2019s up to. The question to Bush and all the GOP candidates is whether what he\u2019s doing in Ukraine is potentially worth American blood.\n\nObama has had his failures, particularly with regard to not doing more sooner to stop Bashar al-Assad\u2019s slaughter of his own people in Syria. But a president\u2019s first job is to ask him or herself: If this leads to my having to send our soldiers in, will the deaths be justified? If nothing else Obama takes that question seriously. Jeb Bush and his fellow candidates seem likely to be willing to box themselves into a rhetorical corner from which the commitment of troops may someday be inevitable, all because they have to stroke the base, and certain money people like Sheldon Adelson.\n\nThe first-job question is one they ought to take more seriously. And I know a certain predecessor of Obama\u2019s who sure as hell should have taken that question more seriously. And if his younger brother believes the rest of don\u2019t have the right to know what he thinks about all that, he doesn\u2019t have a much better idea of what the presidency is than his brother did.", "score": 4, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:12.668+0000"}
{"entityId": 1487, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The libertarian senator is famously skeptical of foreign wars. So why are his advisers suddenly comparing him to the coldest of Cold Warriors?\n\nWhen it comes to international affairs, Rand Paul is the new Ronald Reagan.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what the junior Kentucky senator\u2019s foreign policy advisers would have you believe.\n\nThroughout Paul\u2019s short political career, he has tried to position himself as someone less inclined to wage war or intervene in other countries than the Obama or Bush White Houses. He claimed the U.S. created a \u201cjihadist wonderland\u201d by over-involving itself in the affairs of the Middle East, and opposed the idea of toppling the dictators in Syria and Libya. Paul has advised that America should resist those who want to \u201ctweak Russia all the time.\u201d And for the crisis in Iraq, he has blamed the Bush administration\u2014namely Dick Cheney, whose ties to Halliburton, Paul suggested in 2009, were driving U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThose positions made it look, to many, like Paul\u2019s worldview mirrored most closely that of his father, the famously doctrinaire libertarian Ron Paul. And maybe that was true, once upon a time. But these days, Paul is publicly entertaining the idea of bombing Iraq, while his advisers have touted him as the second coming of Cold Warriors like Dwight Eisenhower (who authorized coups in Guatemala and in Iran), George H.W. Bush (the Gulf War\u2019s Commander-in-Chief), and Ronald Reagan (the president who presided over Iran-Contra, El Salvador, Lebanon, Grenada, and the Mujahideen insurgency in Afghanistan as part of his multi-pronged offensive against the Soviet \u201cEvil Empire\u201d).\n\nIf these don\u2019t sound like the role models of an isolationist libertarian, you are paying attention. As the Republican convention nears, Paul is moving closer to a perceived conservative middle-ground on foreign policy. It is a recasting that is deeply at odds with how Paul is perceived by his enemies and by many of his supporters. But to hear his advisers tell it, he barely changed at all.\n\n\u201cTo begin, I guess you could say what he\u2019s not: he\u2019s not a neoconservative, a unilateralist on the one hand; and he\u2019s not what some people call a liberal interventionist on the other,\u201d Richard Burt, a former ambassador to Germany and State Department adviser to Ronald Reagan, who acts as an unofficial foreign policy adviser to Paul, told me. \u201cI would put him in the mold of a traditional, Republican internationalist\u2014more along the lines of a kind of Dwight Eisenhower, to some extent, Ronald Reagan, and maybe George H.W. Bush, in the sense that he, I think, he certainly is not an isolationist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would put him in the mold of a traditional, Republican internationalist\u2014more along the lines of a kind of Dwight Eisenhower, to some extent, Ronald Reagan, and maybe George H.W. Bush, in the sense that he, I think, he certainly is not an isolationist.\u201d\n\nBurt is part of an informal, unpaid foreign policy team who regularly briefs Paul on international issues. In addition to Burt, the group includes Rob Givens, a retired U.S. Air Force brigadier general from Kentucky, and Elise Jordan, Condoleezza Rice\u2019s one-time speechwriter, and Lorne Craner, a former John McCain staffer and the head of the International Republican Institute. Hardly a collection of pacifists.\n\n\u201cI would say that he is quite a realist, in that he does have a very high bar for military intervention as, I think, Reagan and Bush did. I would also cite Eisenhower,\u201d Craner said.\n\nBut Paul has not always appeared confident as he followed in these presidents\u2019 footsteps.\n\nTake Iraq. When Paul arrived to his home state of Kentucky on Monday, four days had passed since Obama became the fourth consecutive U.S. president to initiate military action in Iraq. During that time, the senator, widely considered the early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, had remained confoundingly silent. When he finally spoke\u2014first in Campbellsville, where he said he has \u201cmixed feelings about\u201d re-engagement but he is not \u201ccompletely opposed to helping with arms or maybe even bombing,\u201d and then in Louisville, where he informed he has an \u201copen mind\u201d about what course of action the U.S. should take\u2014he fell victim to needling from the left wing, for what was interpreted as a flip on his supposed anti-interventionist ideals, and from the right wing, for what some saw as a misguided attempt at hawkishness from someone with an inherently isolationist worldview.\n\nThose interpretations of Paul\u2019s position have earned him staunch enemies in more mainstream Republican interventionists (and to an extent, it seems Paul\u2019s enemies have exploited that interpretation for their own benefit). Texas Governor Rick Perry\u2014widely considered a likely future primary challenger for Paul\u2014has called Paul\u2019s \u201cisolationist\u201d leanings \u201ccuriously blind\u201d; former Vice President Dick Cheney publicly chided him by saying, \u201cRand Paul, with all due respect, is basically an isolationist. He doesn\u2019t believe we ought to be involved in that part of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all due respect\u201d because \u201cisolationist,\u201d Cheney knows, is a deeply politically damaging insult.\n\nPaul\u2019s camp, of course, rejects the term wholeheartedly. They\u2019re even careful to tiptoe around the term \u201canti-interventionist\u201d: \u201cI think even that is going a little far,\u201d Craner told me. \u201cThe term has connotations of a category that he does not fall into.\u201d\n\nStill, Paul\u2019s history and record have made his \u201cisolationist\u201d reputation hard to shake, and it threatens to toxify the air surrounding his all-but-certain presidential campaign.\n\nAs I outlined last month, Paul\u2019s political career was launched, in no small part, with the strength of his father\u2019s supporters who took him at his word that their views were \u201cvery, very similar.\u201d The elder Paul has also balked at the I-word, but nonetheless, was frequently branded with it throughout his decades-long political career in Congress and as a presidential candidate. He memorably called to end all foreign wars and shut down all foreign military bases. He has blamed U.S. foreign policy for a myriad of global issues\u2014from the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 in Ukraine to the September 11 terror attacks. On the anniversary of the latter, in 2013, he wrote on Facebook: \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to believe that the perpetrators of 9/11 hated us for our freedom and goodness. In fact, the crime was blowback for decades of U.S. intervention in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nBurt told me that the elder Paul contributes to the misconceptions about Rand: \u201cIt\u2019s the obvious point, It\u2019s the elephant in the room\u2014that he\u2019s his father\u2019s son. I think there\u2019s a tendency to believe that his approach to foreign policy is similar to his father\u2019s\u2014and, to a limited degree, I think it is.\u201d\n\nBen Friedman, a research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, offered: \u201cPeople are just kind of assuming that he starts off with the same views as his father, so every time he says something that\u2019s more in line with the conventional wisdom, he\u2019s betraying those views\u2014and I think that\u2019s not really fair.\u201d\n\nIt was during one of his father\u2019s presidential campaigns, in 2007, that the younger Paul addressed supporters in Virginia, telling them, \u201cOur national security is not threatened by Iran having one nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, when he was a candidate for Senate, the comment was seized upon by his primary opponent, Trey Grayson, who (not that it helped much) secured the support of the establishment GOP\u2014like Cheney. At the time, Grayson told the Louisville Courier-Journal: \u201cHe\u2019s much more of an isolationist on a whole host of issues...Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Patriot Act...I\u2019m much more of a peace-through-strength kind of Republican.\u201d (It should be noted that libertarians think the notion that someone could be a degree of isolationist is like being half-pregnant.)\n\nAsked about Paul\u2019s view of the previous administration, Craner explained: \u201cI think the issue he has there is the Iraq War and how we got into it. He\u2019s never criticized Cheney to me, and I\u2019ve spent quite a bit of time with him. I think he\u2019s spent some time with Bush 43 and is quite fond of him, but I think the big issue for him is \u2018How did we get into Iraq?\u2019 and we need to be a lot more careful in the future.\u201d\n\nSince entering the Senate, Paul has staked out a number of positions that have emboldened critics who are eager to dismiss him as an isolationist.\n\nMemorably, Paul conducted a 13-hour filibuster in 2013 on the nomination of Obama\u2019s CIA director, John Brennan, to protest drones strikes of Americans in the U.S. Paul\u2019s filibuster resulted in the administration clarifying that drones would not be used on American citizens on American soil. Paul angered some of his supporters when he came out to say something very different: \u201cIf someone comes out of a liquor store with a weapon and fifty dollars in cash, I don\u2019t care if a drone kills him or a policeman kills him.\u201d Paul has since clarified that he would not, in fact, support drone use in normal criminal situations.\n\nIn 2011, Paul proposed ending all foreign aid as a means of helping to close the budget deficit (foreign aid, by the way, accounts for less than 2 percent of the budget)\u2014including foreign aid to Israel, which caused some trouble for him on the not-yet-campaign trail in Iowa last week, when he claimed he had \u201cnever\u201d suggested such a thing. Indeed, it would be difficult to imagine Reagan or Bush making a proposal like that.\n\nWhen Paul suggested cutting aid to Pakistan last month, he used as reasoning the \u201cpersecution\u201d of Christians\u2014a theme that often arises when he talks foreign policy.\n\nA senior aide of his explained that weighing what impact intervention would have on Christians would be a major factor in decision-making: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot you can point to [that suggests] we have made the situation remarkably worse for Christians over the last 10 years\u2026 Right after we went into Iraq, hundreds of thousands of Christians fled the country with fear of religious persecution.\u201d In part because of this, Paul is \u201cnot going to be looking to jump around the globe.\u201d\n\nPaul fervently opposed involvement in Syria, and he was against intervening in Libya (which he referred to as \u201cHillary\u2019s war\u201d while in Iowa last week)\u2014even as dictators there slaughtered thousands. These are positions that, at least at first glance, don\u2019t seem to fall in line with the notion that the senator is anything like the internationalist commanders-in-chief his advisers like to cite.\n\nBut, \u201cthere are different forms of intervention,\u201d as Burt notes. \u201cI was thinking today, for example, I remember during the Reagan administration, when in response to a Libyan terrorist attack in Berlin\u2026 Ronald Reagan launched an airstrike against Tripoli in Libya. That was one, discreet military action. [But] that\u2019s vastly different than the sustained bombing campaign that the Obama administration undertook with the European allies that led to Qaddafi\u2019s downfall a year ago.\u201d\n\nPaul said he would have voted against using force in Syria, and claimed Obama was unconstitutionally waging attacks. He openly worried that by arming rebels, the U.S. was \u201cfunding the allies of Al Qaeda\u201d who, he charged, were persecuting Christians. Speaking at the Values Voters Summit in 2013, Paul told the audience that in Syria, American tax dollars were being used to prop up the war on Christianity.\n\n\u201cWe have made the situation remarkably worse for Christians over the last 10 years\u2026 Right after we went into Iraq, hundreds of thousands of Christians fled the country with fear of religious persecution.\u201d In part because of this, Paul is \u201cnot going to be looking to jump around the globe.\u201d\n\nPaul also explicitly called for the preservation of the Assad regime, which has at times been an ally of the country\u2019s Christians. Paul warned that \u201cif we were to get rid of Assad, it would be a jihadist wonderland in Syria. It\u2019s not a jihadist wonderland in Iraq, precisely because we got over-involved, not because we had too little involvement, but too much involvement.\u201d\n\nBut when he spoke on Monday about the airstrikes in Iraq, Paul said, \u201cISIS is big and powerful because we protected them in Syria.\u201d If there is any evidence to support that claim, Paul\u2019s camp would not say. They did not respond to multiple requests for clarification.\n\nMeanwhile, it is easy to argue that laying off of Assad\u2014Paul\u2019s position as of last month\u2014is, in effect, a form of protection for ISIS. Assad\u2019s forces have repeatedly declined to shell ISIS positions in Syria; and ISIS sells its captured oil to the regime in Damascus. Many American politicians\u2014from Hillary Clinton to John McCain\u2014have called for the arming of the so-called \u201cmoderate rebels\u201d of the Free Syrian Army, who fight both Assad and ISIS simultaneously. Paul is in the other camp.\n\nAgain and again, Paul and his foreign policy advisers have been consistent in saying that he would support using military force when necessary\u2014like in the case of the war in Afghanistan. They\u2019ve tried to portray him as an old-school statesman, supportive of a muscular, if limited, American role in the world. But all too often, Paul\u2019s words seem to undo all the positioning work.\n\nWith a certain boastfulness, and as if to fill in the gaps of his publicly known worldview, his advisers all noted\u2014separately\u2014that Paul is a student of George Kennan\u2019s philosophy. Kennan was the legendary Cold War strategist who authored the doctrine of containment. That doctrine committed the United States to military alliances like NATO and aimed to stop the spread of communism. And perhaps a bit ironically, considering the attempt to cast Paul as a skeptical interventionist, at times the containment doctrine meant engaging in proxy wars with the Soviet Union and relied heavily on the intelligence agencies like the NSA that Paul has taken aim at as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nIn a 2013 speech at the Heritage Foundation, Paul said: \u201cNo one believes that Kennan was an isolationist, but Kennan did advise that non-interference in the internal affairs of another country was, after all, a long-standing principle of American diplomacy.\u201d The bar for what warrants intervention set by Kennan, Paul suggested, was \u201ca sufficiently powerful national interest,\u201d and possessing \u201cthe means to conduct such an intervention successfully and can afford the cost.\u201d (Craner noted that the senator has not only read Kennan\u2019s two-volume memoir, but also the scholarly biography of Kennan by John Lewis Gaddis.)\n\nBecause Paul has made clear that his bar for intervening is set very high, I was curious about what, specifically, that meant. Why be open to intervening in Iraq, but not in Syria? Asked about this, his advisers said American action had to depend the level of interest the U.S. has, and if there can be a clearly defined objective. As a senior aide put it, Paul \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to be everywhere all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican interests have to be directly threatened, and part of that is in the interest of an ally...all of our reactions should be defensive in nature,\u201d Givens added. (Critics of Paul\u2019s suggest that only intervening when America faces a direct threat would be ignoring the root of the issue, and the reality that international conflicts tend to impact one another.)\n\nSpecifically, Burt offered, \u201cHe clearly opposed the invasion of Iraq, and he, I think, questioned the military action in Libya, but, I think, in the case currently in Iraq, he sees this as limited, to some extent humanitarian, but also to the extent that it supports the Kurds who we have shared interest with, I think he sees this as a discreet, limited used of effective American power.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s advisers paint the picture of a would-be candidate who understands he has a lot to learn, and that he needs to learn it quickly. About a month ago, Burt told me, the team brought in experts on Iran and nuclear issues, so that they could discuss prospects for reaching an agreement; more recently, a group collected to talk about China\u2019s economy and its conflicts with Japan and other countries in Southeast Asia. \u201cHe\u2019s getting up to speed on foreign policy,\u201d Burt explained.\n\nGivens, who told me he first met with Paul around February and discussed the situation in Iraq with him a few weeks ago, recalled: \u201cWhen we first started talking [about] the airstrikes in Iraq, there were a lot of questions about, \u2018OK, what can we do with airstrikes? How would they work? What\u2019s a threat to our aircraft?\u2019 You know, \u2018What can we accomplish? What can the pilot see?\u2019 Those types of very specific questions.\u201d\n\n\n\nAsked if the briefings seemed like practice, Givens said, laughing, \u201cWe\u2019re never playing the game of \u2018OK, you\u2019re the president! What would you do?\u2019 Or anything along those lines.\u201d\n\nBut then, Givens gave a bit of a different answer. \u201cIs part of this, perhaps, a preparation for a White House run? Clearly, it\u2019s got to be,\u201d he said. And maybe Givens isn\u2019t the only one changing course.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrection: a previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Rand Paul's comments about Russia were made in the days after the invasion of Crimea.

The next day, he took a much more significant step involving another Bluegrass State icon: hiring a Kentucky political legend who for decades has crossed the aisles to build bridges\u2014literally\u2014with the president\u2019s chief antagonist.\n\nAnd this appointment could perhaps prove to be a small step toward bipartisan problem-solving in our polarized and paralyzed nation\u2019s capital.\n\nJerry Abramson, Kentucky\u2019s lieutenant governor and formerly Louisville\u2019s longest serving mayor, was named Thursday as the new White House Director of Intergovernmental Affairs. He\u2019s no stranger to Washington: After volunteering on Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s 1968 presidential campaign, Abramson subsequently attended law school at Georgetown University.\n\nDuring that latter stint, he\u2019d trudge over weekly to the Capitol Hill office of Kentucky Senator Marlow Cook (R), who generously allowed him the opportunity to use his free WATS line to report home to mom and dad. During those visits, Abramson stoked the embers of a relationship with Cook\u2019s administrative assistant, a young lawyer named Mitch McConnell. (Ironically, Abramson at the same time developed a friendship with another young Cook aide, John Yarmuth, now a liberal Democratic congressman who prides himself as McConnell\u2019s leading in-state adversary.)\n\nAlas, there will be no buddy movie to capture the Abramson/McConnell rapport. Personality-wise, the two native Louisvillians are polar opposites: The former \u201cMayor for Life\u201d is a dynamic extrovert, with Clintonian interpersonal skills and a booming, enthusiastic charisma; while McConnell\u2026 well, my sources report that he might have even cracked a tiny smile after his landslide reelection victory on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, from a political perspective, they\u2019ve always been in opposite camps: Indeed, in several cycles, Democrats passionately urged Jerry to run against the senator, and undoubtedly he would have proven a much stronger challenger than any of Mitch\u2019s eventual opponents.\n\nDespite any partisan enmities, the two top politicos maintained a cordial relationship. Abramson says that he and his wife have run into the McConnells too many times to recount, most memorably at neighborhood grocery stores, and often share friendly bonhomies about family, life outside of the spotlight, and their mutual passion for University of Louisville sports.\n\nDuring the two decades the two overlapped in office, Louisville\u2019s infrastructure was dramatically improved, the leading example involving a multibillion-dollar project to build new bridges to span the Ohio River.\n\nMuch more significantly, while Abramson served as mayor during McConnell\u2019s tenure as U.S. senator, to quote the president\u2019s new mantra, they got stuff done, together. During the two decades the two overlapped in office, Louisville\u2019s infrastructure was dramatically improved, the leading example involving a multibillion-dollar project to build new bridges to span the Ohio River. While Abramson provided the public leadership and worked with state officials to secure the essential political, regulatory, and financial support, McConnell help earmark necessary federal dollars to complete the initiative.\n\nThe two men\u2019s most publicized alliance involved an effort critical to Louisville\u2019s economic growth and development into a leading national urban center\u2014the merger of city and county government. In the last half of the 20th century, Jefferson County was plagued by redundant bureaucracies and elected official infighting that was inherent to a political system in which dozens of small city fiefdoms imposed their territorial will. For decades, the city\u2019s civic and business community leaders fought to establish a merged city/county political infrastructure to enable efficient, transparent, and workable government.\n\nBut with small town officials fighting fiercely for continued control of their political and financial turf, voter referendums over four decades soundly rejected the proposed consolidation.\n\nThat is until 2000. Abramson, who at the time was on the political sidelines having been term-limited, joined forces with McConnell to co-chair efforts to pass merged government. McConnell appealed to the Republican minority that was naturally hostile to bigger government; Abramson pleaded with his political base, which gleefully understood that they could send him back into power in a new, consolidated mayoral office. And by a 54 to 46 percent margin, the merger measure passed, propelling Louisville\u2019s status to one of the largest 18 cities in the nation.\n\nOf course, Abramson told The Daily Beast that \u201cliaison to the Senate Majority Leader\u201d is not in his new job description: He will be focusing on working with governors, mayors, tribal leaders, and other local officials on efforts to improve infrastructure, promote affordable housing, and secure better health-care opportunities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely excited because I feel my 35 years of public service in local and state government give me a leg up in efforts to implement the administration\u2019s agenda at the grassroots,\u201d Abramson said. \u201cOur state and local governments are the laboratories of our democracy, and I can\u2019t wait to bring my energies to bring change to our nation\u2019s communities.\u201d\n\nThe timing of Abramson\u2019s hiring, however, as well as his new proximity in the West Wing, imply that Obama might at least be a little curious about the former Louisville mayor\u2019s advice on dealing with his prominent adversary.\n\nMore significantly, Abramson\u2019s appointment could prove to be an important signal toward Obama finally fulfilling his post-partisan promise in his last two years. Lyndon Johnson famously complained that none of John Kennedy\u2019s \u201cbest and brightest\u201d advisers had ever run for sheriff\u2014that the country\u2019s top intellectuals did not understand the lives of ordinary Americans, nor had they ever had the training provided by the hand-to-hand combat of local politics. Some critics have made the same sorts of arguments about the remote and effete president.\n\nIndeed, one of those critics had some very positive things to say about the Abramson appointment: \u201cThis is a great honor for Jerry, who I have known for many years,\u201d Mitch McConnell told the Louisville Courier-Journal. \u201cWe have worked together on important issues impacting the commonwealth, and it is always good to have a Kentuckian in the White House. I wish Jerry well in his new role.\u201d\n\nIs this a signal of d\u00e9tente from a man who has finally reached his dream job and may be looking to a familiar working partner to help burnish his political legacy? Perhaps.\n\nBut regardless of McConnell\u2019s next steps, with Jerry Abramson, Obama has found himself someone who understands that policy progress most often results from non-ideological, bipartisan problem-solvers shedding their labels, rolling up their sleeves, and taking action on the issues that desperately need our attention. He\u2019s also found himself an ally with longstanding intelligence about the enemy, and an even deeper understanding that when we stop viewing the other side as the enemy\u2014and work together on the common good\u2014great things can happen.\n\nIn Jerry Abramson, a new sheriff is in town. Let\u2019s hope the president uses him wisely.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:13.599+0000"}

Wow wow wow!\u201d Trump bellowed like a baritone Sally Field. \u201cUnbelievable! Unbelievaaaaable! Ugh, thank you. That\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d\n\nThen, he said, \u201cNow I know how the great Billy Graham felt, because it\u2019s the same feeling.\u201d Billy Graham, the conservative Christian evangelist and presidential spiritual adviser, got his start preaching outdoors on street corners, in front of bars, and in the parking lot of a dog racetrack. \u201cWe love Billy Graham,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe LOVE Billy Graham.\u201d In 2013, Trump attended Graham\u2019s 95th birthday in North Carolina, along with Rupert Murdoch, Glenn Beck, and Sarah Palin.\n\nAccording to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released hours before Trump\u2019s stop in Mobile, almost 32 percent of Republicans surveyed support Trump\u2014Jeb Bush, his establishment rival, boasts the support of just 16 percent of the GOP.\n\nHe said his book is his \u201csecond favorite book of all time,\u201d and then asked the crowd what his first favorite book is. He seemed to smirk before he shouted, \u201cTHE BIBLE!!!\u201d\n\nTrump explained to the crowd that he needed to host his event in the partially-empty stadium because initially, when it was scheduled to take place in a hotel, they were only expecting between 250 and 300 people. But in case you haven\u2019t been listening, Trump is a yooooge deal. When word got out about Trump\u2019s event, according to Trump, the hotel called to say they couldn\u2019t accommodate everyone. Next, Trump said, the campaign tried the Convention Center, but the size of Trump\u2019s expected crowd grew so much that it surpassed the venue\u2019s 10,000-person capacity. \u201cSo, we came here!\u201d Trump exclaimed, throwing his arms out. \u201cWe came here.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Philip Bump surmised that Trump chose Mobile because it \u201clies on the Gulf Coast\u201d in close proximity to \u201cother big population centers\u201d like New Orleans and Tallahassee, and, less close but still not far, Birmingham and Atlanta.\n\nWhatever his reason for being there, Trump sure seemed at home. He laughed and joked with the crowd. At one point, he walked around to the front of the podium, reached down into the audience, and plucked a copy of his book, The Art of the Deal from the hands of a female fan. Trump, ladykiller, called her \u201cbeautiful.\u201d He said his book is his \u201csecond favorite book of all time,\u201d and then asked the crowd what his first favorite book is.

And that\u2019s as good as evangelicals are going to get from him.\n\nAt another point, Trump took his \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d hat off his head and ran his fingers through his hair, joking that he would prove to the skeptics that it\u2019s real.\n\nLater, a plane flew overhead, and he glanced up to the sky. Earlier in the day, a pro-Jeb Bush plane had flown by, with the message, \u201cTRUMP 4 HIGHER TAXES. JEB 4 PREZ.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh, somebody stole my plane!\u201d Trump smiled, \u201cDammit.\u201d\n\nMost candidates give more or less the same exact speech everywhere they go.\n\nThey tell the same heartfelt anecdotes and the same jokes with the same inflections to poor saps in state after state, county after county, day after day. But Trump, as he noted in Mobile (in a speech which lasted over an hour), is yoooge and popular and therefore every single time he speaks, it\u2019s carried live on multiple television networks. So while he basically maintains his bullet points\u2014immigrants are bad, America is getting beat by China, I\u2019m really rich, Mexico is making America look bad, my military will be fabulous, did I mention I\u2019m really rich\u2014he rarely says the same thing twice.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s for that reason that Trump speeches never feel predictable, even though his biases are unwavering. He is a sputtering sprinkler of bigotry, flowery adjectives, and non sequiturs.\n\n\u201cIsrael? I loooooooove Israel,\u201d he said at one point while discussing foreign policy.\n\n\u201cWe have dummies we have dummies we have dummies!\u201d He complained of U.S. leaders.\n\nHis military, he said, will be \u201cso big and so great\u201d that \u201cnobody\u2019s gonna mess with us, folks\u2014nobody.\u201d\n\nWhile he warned that \u201cMexico is the new China,\u201d Trump informed his public that Nabisco, the creator of such beloved childhood snacks as Oreos, plans to move its factory there. \u201cI LOVE OREOS,\u201d Trump shouted.

That time desperately needs to be spent on transforming the classification system and modernizing electronic records retention policies, as promised in the Obama administration\u2019s second National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership nearly two years ago.\n\nIt is hard to reconcile Clinton\u2019s actions with her speech at the 2012 opening session of the Open Government Partnership: \u201cIn the 21st century, the United States is convinced that one of the most significant divisions among nations will not be north/south, east/west, religious, or any other category so much as whether they are open or closed societies. We believe that countries with open governments, open economies, and open societies will increasingly flourish. They will become more prosperous, healthier, more secure, and more peaceful.\u201d\n\nShe was right then. It is essential to maintain the records of our policymakers for historical analysis so that the public can know what actions have been taken in our name by our leaders. Clinton did not maintain these records. The fact is she indisputably broke the rules, and although that is not a criminal offense, it certainly is a political one.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Jason Amerine is being investigated by the Army Criminal Investigation Division over accusations of revealing classified information to Congress, which is permitted by law to receive disclosures about wrongdoing in the executive branch.\n\nEven more infuriating is the disparity of treatment between the politically powerful and everyday truth-tellers. High-level officials often receive little more than a tap on the wrist for mishandling classified information. But whistleblowers seeking to expose wrongdoing and protect the public are almost without exception subjected to overzealous investigations and prosecution.\n\nRather than focusing on the distinction between whether a person deliberately released classified information or not, the more appropriate lens is whether there was an intended public benefit for that disclosure, such as protecting public health or safety or revealing wrongdoing.\n\nOf course the Secretary of State had some classified information in her emails. As Bill Leonard, former director of the federal Information Security Oversight Office, told Reuters, information that foreign officials give U.S. officials in confidence is \u201cborn classified.\u201d\n\nAnd yes, the government is dramatically overclassifying information. Clinton herself tweeted that the government\u2019s ridiculous classification rules are the \u201creal problem.\u201d But rather than tackling the many problems with the classification system, or investigating Clinton through the post-Wikileaks \u201cinsider threat\u201d program created to investigate individuals who exploited, compromised, or made an unauthorized disclosure of classified information, the State Department has spent weeks defending their former boss and claiming dismissively that nothing was classified at the time anyway.\n\nGeneral Petraeus, who deliberately gave classified information to his lover/biographer, was afforded similar latitude, with Senator Feinstein going so far as to make a public plea for clemency in his case. In the end he was only given a paltry fine\u2014one that he will be able to pay off with less than one of his speaking engagement fees.\n\nThe Department of Defense Inspector General (IG) tried to bury, and then gutted, its own report that concluded then-CIA Director Leon Panetta had released classified information about the Osama bin Laden raid to the Zero Dark Thirty Hollywood producers. Panetta was never penalized despite the IG\u2019s findings.\n\nIn stark comparison, even national security whistleblowers who worked through proper channels, including reporting to their superiors, Inspectors General, and the Congress, are faced with a white-hot vindictive frontal attack from the government.\n\nNSA whistleblower Tom Drake and Justice Department whistleblower Thomas Tamm both had armed FBI agents raid their homes. Drake reported to the Pentagon IG and Congress about the NSA\u2019s unconstitutional and wasteful overreach through its domestic surveillance program (years before Edward Snowden). Tamm also challenged the legality of the government\u2019s warrantless wiretap program.\n\nTamm lost his clearance and his government career. Drake was prosecuted for espionage and lost his career after pleading to the misdemeanor of \u201cexceeding the authorized use of a computer.\u201d Both spent a fortune on attorneys.\n\nAir Marshal Robert MacLean had to take his case all the way to the Supreme Court to prove that he had a right to reveal unclassified information to a TV reporter about the TSA\u2019s decision to remove air marshals from high-risk flights after 9/11. His disclosure forced the TSA to reverse their plan and to better protect the public by keeping air marshals on cross-country flights. MacLean won, but he and his family had to put their lives on hold while he fought his case for years without a paycheck.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Jason Amerine is being investigated by the Army Criminal Investigation Division over accusations of revealing classified information to Congress, which is permitted by law to receive disclosures about wrongdoing in the executive branch. His disclosure to Congress led the White House to overhaul its hostage recovery policies. Yet his retirement from the military, after an extraordinary and decorated career in the Army, has been put on hold indefinitely as the investigation drags on.\n\nOur system now protects the powerful and attacks the heroes, both of which are fundamentally un-American.\n\nSo let\u2019s stop wasting time making politically expedient proclamations that serve no purpose but to score points for candidates. There are real issues all the campaigns should address: We need to dramatically shrink the incidence of and incentives for overclassification. We also need to apply a public interest balancing test so that when there is an alleged breach of classified information, the violation is weighed against the benefits of the information becoming known. And we need to level the playing field so that there aren\u2019t different accountability standards for those with clout and those without.\n\nIf the dialogue doesn\u2019t change, most federal employees who witnesses waste, fraud, or abuse will feel the chill and decide against stepping forward while the politically powerful class will continue to be rewarded and see their transgressions forgiven.\n\n\n\nDanielle Brian is the executive director of the Project on Government Oversight (POGO)\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:14.646+0000"}

Former Pastry Chef Roland Mesnier said he \u201cmade many, many mocha cakes\u201d during this period, and that Hillary would often call up \u201cin a small, unassuming voice\u201d and ask for a mocha cake that night.\n\nThe staff thought Hillary knew about Monica.\n\nIn the eyes of some of the staff, Monica Lewinsky was not part of some vast right-wing conspiracy, and Clinton \u201cknew about Lewinsky long before it came out.\u201d\n\nChelsea Clinton called the Secret Service \u201cpigs.\u201d\n\nFormer White House florist Ron Payne told the author that he overheard an exchange between Chelsea and a Secret Service agent.

In 1916, Boetcker published the list of \u201c10 Cannots,\u201d a collection of personal truisms largely centered around the benefits of laissez-faire capitalism. The axioms have been mistakenly attributed to Lincoln for decades.\n\nSo why do Kasich and others tie these quotes to Lincoln? It stems with Boetcker himself, according to Did Lincoln Own Slaves? And Other Frequently Asked Questions About Abraham Lincoln, a book by Gerald Prokopowicz, a Lincoln expert at East Carolina University.\n\nIn 1916, Boetcker published leaflets that had a real Lincoln quote on one side and his \u201ccannots\u201d on the other. A reader could easily assume these were also Lincoln quotes, and they did.\n\nProbably the best-documented misuse of these quotes came from President Reagan at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston.\n\nInterestingly, Lincoln\u2019s position on taxes doesn\u2019t even appear to line up with the quote Kasich misattributed to him.\n\nLincoln signed the first federal income taxes into law in 1861 in order to fund the Civil War. What\u2019s more, these taxes were progressive\u2014meaning that the wealthier people paid higher tax rates on their income. The highest rate, 5 percent, applied to incomes roughly equivalent to $1 million today, Prokopowicz told us.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that signing the bill indicated his approval, Lincoln thus approved of the concept of higher taxes on the wealthy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is consistent with Lincoln\u2019s politics generally.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s claim rates Pants on Fire.\n\nElsewhere, ABC\u2019s pundit panel discussed the road ahead to 2016, as well as the political ground Democrats have lost over the past six years.\n\nAt one point Cokie Roberts dropped a headline-grabbing statistic that we thought warranted a closer look. She said that since Obama has been president, \u201cHe\u2019s lost more than 900 state legislators.\u201d\n\nHave that many Democrats left the halls of state capitols across the country?\n\nActually, yes. Our analysis of data from the National Conference of State Legislatures shows Democrats have lost 910 seats since Obama took office.\n\nWe compared the number of Democratic seats in early 2009, when Obama took office, to the number of seats after the 2014 midterms. The bottom line: Republicans now control about 56 percent of the country\u2019s 7,383 state legislative seats, up 12 percentage points since 2009.\n\nThirty-five states posted double-digit seat losses for the Democrats in state legislatures, including more than 50 seats each in Arkansas, New Hampshire, and West Virginia. Democrats actually gained a few states over the course of Obama\u2019s presidency in New Jersey (one) and Illinois (three), and the number of Democratic seats stayed the same in California.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s national and local resurgence under the Democratic-controlled White House is not surprising, in part, because of the historical trend for two-term presidencies. Political analysts say it\u2019s a sure thing that a political party prospers when it wins the White House but loses its influence across the country soon after.\n\n\u201cYou have a pretty consistent pattern of surge and decline, and you can trace it throughout the two-party era in American politics,\u201d said Larry Sabato, a political expert at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\n\nWhat is surprising about losses under Obama is, with two years to go, they are worse than usual.\n\nThe shedding of U.S. House seats, state legislative seats, and statehouse control is at least twice the average two-term losses from Presidents Truman through George W. Bush, Sabato told us.\n\nAs for Roberts\u2019s claim, it rates True.\n\nKatie Sanders contributed to this report.

But the Republicans are no longer that stupid.\n\nWith Labor Day now behind us, Americans returning from their summer break are just starting to pay attention to the looming midterm election. If you listen to congressional Democrats, they will tell you that we are just days away from a Republican-led government shutdown. Republicans, they would have you believe, would take such a drastic action in retaliation over President Obama\u2019s expected amnesty that would allow millions of undocumented aliens to stay in the United States without fear of deportation. To show their disapproval, the thinking goes, the Republicans would shut the government down in an act of petulance to retaliate against Obama and show their constituents they were standing up to the president.\n\nAs far as a strategy goes, the Democrats would be on to something\u2014if only that\u2019s what congressional Republicans were planning to do in the coming days. Unfortunately for them, Republicans have no plans to shut down the government in time to avert what many Democrats believe will be a tough referendum on them and the president in November. If you listen to prominent Republicans such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) or Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) they will tell you that a government shutdown isn\u2019t going to happen. Ditto with House Speaker John Boehner on the other side of the Capitol.\n\nTo be fair, there have been a few Republicans who have offered commentary in recent days that has given Democrats hope their partisan opponents will self-implode over a government shutdown. Rep. Steve King (R-IA) has not shied away from linking a government shutdown to potential amnesty should President Obama proceed to do so in the coming days. Ditto Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL). I won\u2019t question the sincerity of either man of trying to draw a line in the sand, but this is a strategy that will fail to garner widespread support. I remember sitting in a House Republican leadership meeting in 1995 when then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-GA) sought to rally his colleagues that a shutdown would draw clear distinctions between Republicans and the Democrat in the White House. Well, it drew a distinction all right, and it was one that tarnished the GOP brand for some time.\n\nNearly 20 years later the result will remain the same\u2014the president will muster the bully pulpit and deploy his Cabinet to explain why hard-headed Republicans have shut down the government, ruined family vacations, and canceled school field trips. I trust Republican leaders aren\u2019t anxious\u2014or stupid\u2014enough to fall into the trap Democrats hope they\u2019ll fall into.\n\nThe last thing Democrats want voters thinking about right before an election is their lockstep solidarity in supporting Obama\u2019s deeply unpopular policies.\n\nAnd to be fair, there is a divide between mainstream conservative Republicans and their fringe counterparts who would seek to shut down the government to signal their disagreement with the budget agreement forged with President Obama through 2015 as well as efforts to de-fund the Export-Import Bank.\n\nAll that being said, does any of this make me believe that the GOP might shut down the government? No. Still, there could be a rebellion in the House caucus. But mostly, I think the Democrats are cynically pushing this shutdown talk as a way to scare their base. There are three main reasons why Democrats persist with the myth the Republicans will shut down the government in the coming days:\n\nThey Have No Solid Issues to Run on in November: Between the phony \u201cWar on Women\u201d and the charge that Republicans are \u201crolling back the clock on voting rights\u201d while planning to impeach President Obama, Democrats have largely tried to scare the electorate in hopes of staving off a Republican takeover of the Senate, which would largely derail the remaining two years of the Obama administration. I was a guest on CNN Monday and anchor Carol Costello asked whether black anger following the tragedy in Ferguson would translate into increased black voter turnout. One problem here: Blacks voted at a greater percentage of the population than whites in the 2012 election. In the key battleground state of North Carolina, for example, blacks outpaced white voters by 7.5 percent in 2012; whipping up phony outrage to \u201cenrage\u201d blacks is a cynical ploy by the Democrats to play the race card and further divide the country. Put another way, why are black leaders such as Rep. John (D-GA) Lewis railing loudly to ensure blacks votes are counted when blacks are already going to the polls in record numbers?\n\nObama Is an Anchor Around the Necks of Democrats Up for Reelection This Fall: With his approval numbers hovering in the low 40s, Obama remains an albatross around the neck of Senate Democrats hoping to retain control of the chamber. Fighting for their political survival, incumbents in North Carolina, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Alaska have taken to the airwaves to criticize the president on a host of issues ranging from the Veterans Administration to energy to health care to immigration. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) went so far in recent days to comment on the record to The New York Times that Senate Democrats \u201cdon\u2019t have much of a relationship\u201d with the leader of their party. The last thing Democrats want voters thinking about right before an election is their lockstep solidarity in supporting Obama\u2019s deeply unpopular policies.\n\nRepublicans Have a Remarkable Ability of Committing Political Suicide: Congressional Democrats undoubtedly get on their knees every night to pray that Republicans will do something stupid to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. From the government shutdown for which they were blamed in the media last year to the gaffes from flawed candidates (think \u201cforcible rape\u201d), Democrats can only hope that Republicans will find a way to blow up their electoral fortunes this November. This year, it isn\u2019t likely to happen. From McConnell to Boehner on down, Republicans recognize they have a better than 50 percent chance to control both chambers of Congress. Staying on message discussing the sluggish economy and Obama\u2019s detachment in addressing the mounting terrorist threat posed by ISIS, Republicans will avoid the errors that could extinguish their political tailwinds heading into November.\n\nDemocrats can wish upon a star that talking up a government shutdown or impeachment of President Obama will dramatically alter their prospects in the midterm elections. Their sympathetic allies in the media will give them all the airtime they need to spread this fiction; the question remains, what will voters think when Democratic claims of Republican chicanery fail to materialize? I suspect they know the answer and are fighting for their political lives.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:15.486+0000"}
{"entityId": 1495, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "No lasting jobs, no cheaper gas, and a chance to kill off one-fourth of U.S. farmland and maybe the planet. Why are both parties going all out to get such a crappy deal?\n\nThe Senate will vote Tuesday on whether to authorize the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. The Republican-led House approved the initiative Friday by a wide margin. The Senate\u2019s still-Democratic majority will bring the bill to the floor for the first time because of newfound support for the initiative within the party, mostly to boost Sen. Mary Landrieu\u2019s bid for reelection in Louisiana as she heads into a runoff with Rep. Bill Cassidy, a Republican. Cassidy leads in every poll of likely voters in that race by an average of 5 percentage points.\n\nSupport for the pipeline has surged among Democratic legislators in the wake of the midterm elections, when Democratic senators in red states were swept out of office. Those that remain\u2014among them Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and Claire McCaskill of Missouri\u2014are eager to boost their pro-energy, pro-business bona fides.\n\nIf Democratic support is new, Republicans\u2019 enthusiasm for the project is not. Friday\u2019s vote was the ninth time the House has approved the pipeline under a Republican majority. As soon as the midterm results had rolled in, the victorious party\u2019s messaging shifted en masse. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus made the TV rounds on Election Night, and by the time he arrived on The Daily Show\u2019s live edition, he had his message down to a T: \u201cI think that what we\u2019re going to see is that the president\u2019s got to come to the table, and both parties are going to have to work together to get things done\u2026 It\u2019s going to take the president saying \u2018I want to work with you, I want to pass some of these jobs bills, I want to pass the Keystone Pipeline and get things done.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a well-worn, exceedingly vague message. From his phrasing, it seems that the pipeline is a no-brainer, a job-creation machine that enjoys support from Republicans and Democrats alike. Priebus mentioned it in seemingly every post-election appearance, references made their way into victory speeches from the GOP\u2019s biggest power players, and they\u2019ve since declared the project\u2019s approval a top priority.\n\nIt seems America\u2019s two major parties are finally coming together in favor of a significant legislative initiative. But should they be?\n\nKeystone XL would be an addition to the existing Keystone Pipeline System. It would be built by TransCanada Corp. and would run from Alberta\u2019s tar-sands fields through Montana and South Dakota to link up with the system in Steele City, Nebraska. It would transport bitumen and liquefied natural gas drawn from the tar sands to refineries on the Gulf Coast, mainly in Texas.\n\nThe XL addition was proposed in 2008, and studies on the project\u2019s potential economic and environmental impact were commissioned in 2010 and 2011. President Obama rejected the project\u2019s application in 2012 amid protests that it would hurt Nebraska\u2019s Sand Hills region. An adjusted route through Nebraska has since been proposed, and a State Department report declared the project\u2019s environmental effect was \u201cnot significant,\u201d but the Obama administration announced in April 2014 that the review of the project has been extended indefinitely.\n\nSo why, you might ask, are many of our leaders so eager to build it? The answer is straightforward: money and political gain.\n\nWhy, if the project will create a lot of jobs and have little environmental impact, does it continue to be met with opposition? To begin with, it won\u2019t actually create many jobs. According to a George Mason University study, via Bloomberg, the pipeline\u2019s construction could create between 2,500 and 20,000 jobs. More likely (PDF), it\u2019ll be between 2,500 and 4,650, assuming that a huge chunk (as much as 50 percent) of steel production will be outsourced to China, Canada, and India. Moreover, when construction ends, the number of permanent jobs could fall to 20. Yes, 20.\n\nA rosier estimate, from the State Department\u2019s report and Newsweek, puts the number of permanent jobs at 35. A study by Cornell\u2019s Global Labor Institute claims that the project may actually kill more American jobs than it creates due to pipeline spills, additional fuel costs in the Midwest, and other factors. It also claims that 85-90 percent of people hired for the line\u2019s construction will not be from the areas through which the pipeline is running.\n\nSo, it won\u2019t create that many jobs. After all, it\u2019s merely taking oil drilled in Canada to pre-existing refineries on the Gulf Coast. But it\u2019s a $7 billion project, and the State Department has said it will have a minimal negative effect on the environment. Plus, it could increase America\u2019s energy independence and strengthen our position in the Middle East and beyond. These are all good reasons to move ahead with the plan, but unfortunately, none of them are actually true.\n\nThe pipeline is a $7 billion project, but only $3 billion-$4 billion of that would be headed to the U.S. The rest is going to wherever that steel is getting outsourced. The claim of reduced dependence on foreign oil suppliers is also suspect. China has already invested billions in Canada\u2019s oil sands, and Chinese corporations are upping their stakes all the time. Much of the oil transported by the pipeline will be refined in Port Arthur, Texas, where the main refinery is half-owned by the state-owned oil company of Saudi Arabia (PDF). The Keystone project is not an American one, but a global one, financed and favored by major multinational oil interests. Besides, real domestic oil production\u2014oil drilled and refined in the U.S. by nominally American companies\u2014has already increased 70 percent under the Obama administration.\n\nAll of this means that the pipeline\u2019s approval would essentially be a continuation of the status quo, with a few billion dollars kicked the U.S. economy\u2019s way. Except that the project would, in spite of the State Department\u2019s claims, have drastic effects on the environment on both local and global levels. That study published by the State Department was conducted by Environmental Resources Management (ERM), a firm that listed TransCanada, the would-be pipeline builder, as a client in its marketing materials a year before it began the Keystone contract.\n\nBoth ERM and TransCanada told the State Department at the time that they had not worked together for at least five years, a term of the contract meant to limit conflict of interest. Of course, any doubts about a conflict of interest evaporated when it emerged that up until the summer of 2013, a division of ERM had been \u201cworking alongside TransCanada on the Alaska Pipeline Project.\u201d These are two in a laundry list of troubling connections between the two companies.\n\nConsidering, then, that the State Department study was conducted by TransCanada\u2019s business partner, it\u2019s little surprise that it failed to find any environmental consequences for the project. The reality is far different. On a local level, pipeline leaks and spills could have a number of drastic effects. Recent leaks from similar lines have been bad. Really bad. A New York Times article cites a 2010 leak of 840,000 gallons of bitumen into Michigan\u2019s Kalamazoo River. The cleanup has cost $1 billion so far, and continues today.\n\nIt also mentions an Arkansas leak that sent 210,000 gallons of bitumen running through the streets of small-town Mayflower and left local residents with respiratory problems, nausea, and headaches. The proposed Keystone route would see it \u201cpass over the Ogallala Aquifer, the lifeblood of Great Plains agriculture,\u201d where the water table is close to the surface. A major leak could poison the water supply of large swaths of the Midwest that add up to one quarter of the nation\u2019s farmland.\n\nThe pipeline also has environmental consequences on a larger scale. The pipeline would encourage accelerated extraction of Canada\u2019s tar sands, which have greenhouse gas emissions 81 percent greater than those of conventional oil. By most measures, it is the dirtiest fossil fuel on the planet. James Hansen, formerly of NASA, claimed in a 2012 op-ed that the tar sands contain twice the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by global oil use in our entire history. If true, its exploitation along with our continued use of fossil fuels at present levels would bring carbon concentration in the atmosphere above the 500 parts per million threshold often discussed by climatologists as the point of no return. That would create an irreversible cycle wherein the climate is beyond our control. Hansen describes it as \u201cgame over for the environment.\u201d\n\nEven if that\u2019s an alarmist prediction, and Canada will exploit their tar sands with or without the Keystone XL Pipeline, there is no question that its construction will not help with controlling emissions, boosting energy independence, or creating jobs. The only people it will benefit are TransCanada, the Canadian oil companies (many part-owned by Chinese and Mideast interests) working in the tar sands, the multinational oil companies who will refine what it brings to the Gulf Coast, and a few thousand workers. Temporarily.\n\nSo why, you might ask, are many of our leaders so eager to build it? The answer is straightforward: money and political gain. The Democrats, feeling vulnerable after a midterm rout, are eager to move to the pro-business center and push through a \u201cjobs plan.\u201d A Nov. 12 Pew Research poll shows 59 percent of Americans favor building the pipeline, which provides some political cover from the backlash Democrats will likely get from environmentalists and other sections of the party\u2019s base.\n\nIt also conveniently caters to the interests of Big Energy, some of the biggest campaign donors to both parties. Republicans, in the House especially, have been pushing Keystone for some time and raking in donations in the process. Now, Blue Dog Democrats like Mary Landrieu are happy to hop on board. After all, some of the world\u2019s biggest energy firms, like Exxon Mobil, have been paying her campaign bills for some time.\n\nAn initiative most thought would be pushed by the Republican majorities in the next Congress will come to the floor in the current lame-duck session. In a rather pathetic political maneuver, the Senate Democrats will try to force the president\u2019s hand before the new Republican majority gets the chance, apparently to help in a single Senate runoff election that will not in any way alter the upper chamber\u2019s political landscape. After all, the Democrats have no chance of keeping their majority even if Landrieu wins.\n\nFor his part, Obama has said he will veto the measure. Pundits widely expected that he would insist on the need to wait for the results of further studies and the Supreme Court ruling on land use in Nebraska. Instead, he came out Thursday with an unequivocal rejection of the premise on which the argument for the pipeline is built: \u201cUnderstand what this project is: It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. It doesn\u2019t have an impact on U.S. gas prices. If my Republican friends really want to focus on what\u2019s good for the American people in terms of job creation and lower energy costs, we should be engaging in a conversation about what we are doing to produce more homegrown energy.\u201d\n\nThe president is right in his criticisms, but wrong to reserve them only for the Republican Party.

It creates revenue, investment, and opportunity. Then there\u2019s the Mexico that deals in misery. It generates tragedy, violence, and a windfall for undertakers.\n\nPe\u00f1a Nieto, the affable and telegenic 48-year-old who put the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) back into power after a dozen years on the sidelines, went to Washington to promote the first vision of Mexico \u2014 that of a friend, ally, neighbor and trading partner.\n\nIn fact, Mexico buys and sells more US goods than any other country on the planet except for Canada. The take comes out to more than $500 billion per year. This is the Mexico that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and most major U.S. corporations, are eager to call amigo.\n\nAnd so, it\u2019s no wonder that, according to senior officials with the Obama administration, the agenda for the meeting between Obama and Pe\u00f1a Nieto will center on economic issues like expanding trade, spurring more development in Mexico, cutting wait times and ensuring the freer flow of people and goods across the U.S.-Mexico border, and providing Mexico with more U.S. dollars to fight its drug war under the Merida Initiative.\n\nImmigration will also come up, according to the officials. Obama is eager to tout his executive action to delay the deportations of perhaps as many as 3 million illegal immigrants. Two-thirds of those who likely to benefit from the new policy are Mexican. While this deferred action is controversial in the United States, in Mexico, what Obama did is universally popular. So he\u2019ll try to get as much mileage out of it as possible.\n\nFor Mexico, the economics are clear. There are an estimated 6-7 million undocumented Mexicans in the United States, whom the Mexican economy doesn\u2019t have room for anyway. And as a bonus, they send home more than $20 billion in remittances each year. So, as far as Mexican officials like Pe\u00f1a Nieto are concerned, the goal is to keep their countrymen here \u2014 and keep them happy.\n\nBut one thing that probably won\u2019t be on the agenda, and, in fact, isn\u2019t likely to be discussed at all is the elephant in the room. Actually, this time, the elephant will be in the street.\n\nWhile Obama and Pe\u00f1a Nieto visit in the White House, there are expected to be thousands of protesters \u2014 most of them Mexican nationals who live in the U.S., both legally and illegally \u2014 screaming and waving placards just outside the gate. They\u2019ll be calling Pe\u00f1a Nieto corrupt, incompetent, sinister, and worse. These protests are an extension of the massive and sometimes violent demonstrations that have roiled Mexico over the last few months. To the protesters on both sides of the border, el presidente is a murderer \u2014 or at least someone who covers up for murderers to help them escape punishment.\n\nYou see, there is another Mexico, one that is not so appealing to business but well known to law enforcement.\n\nTo the protesters on both sides of the border, el presidente is a murderer \u2014 or at least someone who covers up for murderers to help them escape punishment.\n\nThis is the Mexico that U.S. college students would be wise to steer clear of on spring break.\n\nThis is the Mexico that often seems trapped in the Third World, the one that is hopelessly corrupt and where the criminal justice system is a dysfunctional relic. This is where criminals \u2014 even those who commit the most heinous of crimes \u2014 usually escape punishment because they\u2019ve been shrewd enough to partner with powerful elected officials who protect them.\n\nThis is the Mexico that has been called a \u201cfailed state\u201d \u2014 most recently by Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Mujica, the president of Uruguay. When the Mexican government protested, Mujica walked back that comment. In fact, the very term \u2014 \u201cfailed state\u201d \u2014 has been sensitive for Mexicans since it first appeared in 2009, in a published study by U.S. military planners. The U.S. Joint Forces Command said that our southern neighbor was one of two countries on the globe that could face a \u201crapid and sudden collapse.\u201d The other country on the list? No less a trouble spot than Pakistan.\n\nThis is the Mexico where you\u2019ll find a real war against women. According to the National Citizen Femicide Observatory, a consortium of 43 groups that seek to document the murders of women, six women are murdered every day in Mexico. Yet only 24 percent of the 3,892 femicides the group identified in 2012 and 2013 were looked at by authorities. And only 1.6 percent of the cases led to someone being arrested and sentenced. Most Mexicans don\u2019t have faith in the country\u2019s criminal justice system, because they\u2019ve never seen it work properly.\n\nAnd lastly, this darker and scarier version of Mexico is the place that appears to have recently swallowed up 43 student teachers in the small town of Iguala, about 120 miles southwest of Mexico City.\n\nOn September 26 \u2014 just 10 days after the festivities celebrating Mexico's Independence Day, a group of young men, between the ages of 18 and 25, who were studying at a nearby teachers college, traveled to Iguala to protest what they claimed were the school's discriminatory hiring practices. The young men were at one point, according to eyewitnesses, apprehended by local police officers. Their bodies were later found incinerated and buried in mass graves outside of town.\n\nEven for a country like Mexico, which has seen its share of bloodshed \u2014 including more than 60,000 dead, and another 40,000 missing, in the first years of the drug war from 2006 to 2012 \u2014 the deaths of \u201cthe 43\u201d was too much to bear. A huge political crisis has ensued, with regular and sometimes violent street protests demanding Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s resignation.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet known whether federal law enforcement officers or the Mexican military played a part in what happened in Iguala, or if they knew it was going to happen beforehand and did nothing to stop it.\n\nWhat is known is that Pe\u00f1a Nieto bungled his response to the crisis. He hasn't bothered to visit Iguala, the place where the students were abducted and killed. He did travel to China and Australia while the story was unfolding. And he didn\u2019t even meet with the grieving parents for several weeks after the students went missing. He appeared heartless and tone deaf.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Mexicans who are protesting outside the White House are enraged. Wouldn\u2019t you be?\n\nIt\u2019s surreal to hear senior administration officials talk about the meeting between Obama and Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u2014 and in fact, the whole relationship between the U.S. and Mexico \u2014- in purely economic terms, as if they were playing Monopoly.\n\nDo you think that, at a moment like this, Mexicans care about how much money some Americans are going to make by doing business with the homeland? Or how much richer a few rich Mexicans are going to get in the process?\n\nThese people are in pain. They\u2019re not thinking about pesos. They\u2019re looking for peace of mind.\n\nAnd so it is that the United States finds itself caught between two Mexicos \u2014 one that looks enticing to the Chamber of Commerce, the other resembling a chamber of horrors.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:16.350+0000"}

What struck me over the course of our conversation is that a violent conflict seems almost inevitable given a few startling revelations.\n\nFirst, the local CBS News affiliate reported a few days ago that a Ferguson resident noted the town \u201cis getting prepared for war\u201d if the grand jury doesn\u2019t indict Officer Darren Wilson in the death of the 18-year-old Michael Brown. Never mind that the autopsy report that was recently released indicates wounds sustained by Brown are consistent with apparent statements by Wilson and six African-American eyewitnesses who claim the teen charged the officer and a scuffle for the gun ensued inside the patrol car. That these six eyewitnesses have remained anonymous for fear of their personal safety is revealing in and of itself.\n\nIn the same news account, civil rights activists from the Don\u2019t Shoot Coalition have asked local prosecutors to provide them with a 48-hour advance notification of the grand jury decision to \u201chelp prevent widespread violence if they have 48 hours to prepare for protests.\u201d The Coalition is comprised of labor unions, anti-war activists, clergy, and so-called black empowerment groups.\n\nQuestion: Does anyone believe this coalition will use a 48-hour window to quell violence? Or will it or seek to incite it? I tend to believe the latter rather than the former given what we saw in the weeks following Brown\u2019s tragic shooting.\n\nSharpton\u2019s view of justice seems to be prejudged and preordained: if Officer Wilson isn\u2019t indicted, justice will not have been served.\n\nIn anticipation, the local police have spent nearly $200,000 to replenish tear gas, less-lethal ammunition, and plastic handcuffs in anticipation of the grand jury\u2019s verdict. Do you think they would have done so if they didn\u2019t anticipate unrest?\n\nThe worst part of all of this is that is seems entirely necessary. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon recently outlined how 1,000 local law enforcement officials received an additional 5,000 hours of training to mitigate potential violence, and the National Guard will be ready at a moment\u2019s notice to step in to assist.\n\nMy question is simply this: where are the Reverends Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson in seeking to quell potential violence? The same is to be asked of our Attorney General, and of the President of the United States, both of whom had no problem calling for a civil rights probe of the shooting but have thus far failed to preemptively warn against potential protests from spiraling out of control.\n\nSharpton and Jackson have indeed spoken out about the situation in Ferguson\u2014but in a manner that appears to inflame rather than calm matters. Just last weekend Sharpton returned to Ferguson for several days of events to call for \u201cjustice\u201d for Michael Brown. At one such event Sharpton offered: \u201cIf there is not justice for this family, then we have not achieved the goals of this movement.\u201d A less provocative approach would have been to appeal for calm and respect the rule of law and the grand jury\u2019s deliberations regardless of its decision. Sharpton\u2019s view of justice seems to be prejudged and preordained: if Officer Wilson isn\u2019t indicted, justice will not have been served.\n\nMuch the same can be said for Jackson\u2019s contributions to calm tensions in the suburban St. Louis city. Writing in USA Today last August, Jackson declared: \u201cMany are observing in Ferguson and witnessing the anger, demonstrations, looting, and vandalism and calling for quiet. But quiet isn\u2019t enough. The absence of noise isn\u2019t the presence of justice\u2014and we must demand justice in Ferguson and the other Fergusons around America.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t think of a more bombastic, irresponsible, and reprehensible set of remarks offered by an alleged civil rights leader. Quiet and the absence of noise (and presumably violence) isn\u2019t enough for Jackson. Only the desired outcome he seeks is the correct one\u2014the work of the grand jury be damned. Apparently peace, calm, and quiet don\u2019t fulfill Jackson\u2019s narrative\u2014perhaps violence, unrest, and racial animus have only driven his agenda all along.\n\nWhile our first African American Attorney General was quick to condemn America for being a \u201cnation of cowards\u201d on matters of race, I find it cowardly that he has not consistently spoken out to respect the work of the grand jury and the rule of law. He was too busy, apparently, seeking to bring federal civil rights charges against the charged officer whose fate has not yet been determined by the grand jury. So much for his impartiality.\n\nAnd where is the President\u2014one so quick to interject himself where race is involved (the Cambridge, Massachusetts police officer acted \u201cstupidly\u201d) but absent when a violent confrontation appears likely if a grand jury does not indict a white officer for the death of a black teenager. He should be speaking out forcefully and frequently about the need for calm as the jurors conclude their work. His silence is both deafening and disheartening.\n\nI find it a sad commentary that the beginning of the Obama era encouraged millions of Americans to think that we had entered a post-racial phase in our evolution as a country from the dark stain that slavery has placed upon our collective history and heritage. As we enter the waning years of the Obama Administration, America remains as divided as ever on matters of race.\n\nResponsible leaders must speak out immediately and urge non-violent reaction to the work of the grand jury investigating the conduct of Officer Wilson. The cornerstone of our democracy is that justice is to be colorblind in its administration. Rather than seek to divide this community and our nation on matter of race, those who speak out for justice for Michael Brown should also respect the rule of law and the decision reached by a jury of their peers whether the determination is made to indict or not.\n\nLet us pray for peace, not violence for Ferguson and our country no matter what the jury in their wisdom might decide.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:16.621+0000"}

Naturally, the Cruz family is involved.\n\nRafael Cruz, the fiery pastor and father of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, is well known for his conservative and Christian bona fides, and now he has inserted himself into a local city council issue in Plano, Texas, claiming an anti-discrimination measure is an \u201cattack on Judeo-Christian beliefs in America.\u201d\n\nThe measure that has Cruz so fired up is an equal rights ordinance passed late last year by the City Council of Plano, Texas. When it was passed, the ordinance\u2019s backers on the Council did not predict much commotion. The measure, after all, merely extended existing provisions forbidding discrimination in housing and employment to include sexual orientation and gender identity, putting the city largely in line with federal law.\n\nInstead, Plano, a city of under 275,000 on the outskirts of Dallas, is quickly becoming a suburban Stonewall.\n\nOpponents of the ordinance say preventing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is against their religious beliefs as Christians, and that being required to follow the new rules is an assault on their personal liberty. That\u2019s an expansive interpretation of religious liberty, but one which has been used across the country by religious conservatives to deny wedding services to same-sex couples and, most famously, for owners of privately held companies who oppose abortion to deny insurance coverage of birth control to women employees.\n\nIn this case, losing the ability to deny gay people access to public housing projects \u201cis an attack on religious freedom, an attack on freedom of speech, an attack on freedom of thought,\u201d said Cleve Doty, counsel at the Liberty Institute, a Plano-based organization \u201cdedicated solely to defending and restoring religious liberty in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law prohibits anyone from offending people based on their sexuality or sexual orientation, sexual identity, those types of things,\u201d Doty said. \u201cThey should call it \u2018The Plano Non-Offense Ordinance\u2019 but I guess that doesn\u2019t sound so good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an attack on Judeo-Christian beliefs in America. It\u2019s time people of faith become involved in the political arena.\u201d\n\nWhen the measure passed 5-3 last month, outraged opponents catcalled council members at a packed public hearing, vowing to vote out of office the five offending lawmakers. One pastor warned the meeting that the measure would \u201cchange the social fabric of the city.\u201d\n\nWhen one attendee yelled out, \u201cSee you in November!\u201d a reference to conservatives\u2019 plans to vote the lawmakers who voted for the bill out of office, first-term Mayor Harry LaRosiliere yelled back, \u201cIt\u2019s May, by the way, not November\u201d\u2014a reference to the fact that municipal elections in Plano occur in the spring, not the fall.\n\nBefore the vote, LaRosiliere, a Democrat, gave a searing defense of the bill, comparing it to efforts to eradicate slavery and segregation.\n\n\u201cFrankly, the question is not, \u2018Why now?\u2019\u201d he told the audience. \u201cThe question is, \u2018What took us so long?\u2019\u201d\n\nConservatives are battling back. The city\u2019s churches are organizing a drive to put the measure to a referendum on the May ballot. They have until Tuesday to turn in the equivalent of 20 percent of residents who voted in the last election: several thousand signatures.\n\nAnd of course, they have Cruz on their side.\n\nAt a press conference announcing the formation of the Texas Pastor Council, an organization dedicated to overturning the measure, the elder Cruz, who lives nearby, said, \u201cThis is an attack on Judeo-Christian beliefs in America,\u201d adding that \u201cIt\u2019s time people of faith become involved in the political arena.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a group calling itself the \u201cPeople in Support of the Equal Rights Policy of Plano, TX\u201d has been distributing flyers that they say call out opponents of the measure on their untruths. Some of these include the ideas that \u201cthe policy promotes \u2018deviant\u2019 sexual behavior,\u201d that it \u201cis part of a \u2018radical left agenda,\u2019\u201d and that it \u201callows \u2018biological males\u2019 to enter women\u2019s restrooms.\u201d\n\nInstead, supporters say, the new policy excludes restrooms, exempts religious organizations, political organizations, non-profits, and businesses with fewer than 15 employees from compliance, and that it \u201cdoes not regulate people\u2019s beliefs,\u201d adding that \u201cif someone\u2019s beliefs result in a conflict with compliance, there is a process for obtaining a waiver.\u201d\n\nDoty, of the Liberty Institute disagrees. He says that under the new law, \u201cIf you look at someone the wrong way, or fail to look at someone the right way,\u201d the \u201cun-elected city manager\u201d can institute an investigation, which could lead to a fine, and if the fine is not paid, imprisonment.\n\n\u201cI hear all kinds of offensive things all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cNow those things are subject to a city investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, this is not a problem here,\u201d Doty added. \u201cThis is Plano, Texas. People generally treat people pretty well, as far as anyone can tell.\u201d\n\nOpponents say that it was passed quickly, under the cover of darkness just before the Christmas season to prevent churches and religious-minded residents from being able to organize. They say that it is remarkably similar in its language to non-discrimination ordinances other cities have passed: proof, they say, that liberal groups in Washington, D.C. are behind the push. They point out that Plano\u2019s representative in the state legislature publicly stated that he had not heard about the measure until the Council brought it up for a vote. That lawmaker, Rep. Matt Shaheen, a Republican, is now planning to bring a bill up for a vote in the state legislature that would prohibit local governments from extending civil rights beyond what is enshrined in the state constitution.\n\nMayor LaRosiliere did not return a request for comment, and backers of the measure appear to be laying low in hopes that the storm will pass.\n\nAt least until Tuesday, that does not seem likely.\n\n\u201cBureaucrats are trying to force us to accept sexual behavior as a protected class alongside race or religion and there are those of us who disagree with that,\u201d said Dave Welch of the Pastor Council. \u201cLGBT people do not meet that standard. They are highly privileged, highly educated. There is no evidence of discrimination against them as a class. Now is there anecdotal evidence of people saying something to them? Yes, but Christians have dealt that with that too.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:16.885+0000"}
{"entityId": 1499, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Senate was set to confirm a new leader for the State Department\u2019s human rights agenda. But at the last minute, Obama\u2019s ambassador to Saudi Arabia cut in\u2014just in time for Obama\u2019s trip to meet the Saudi King.\n\nLast week, Secretary of State John Kerry made calls to senators urging them to confirm the State Department\u2019s top human rights official; he thought the Senate leadership was on board. But suddenly, the White House stepped in and bumped the human rights nominee in favor of Joseph William Westphal, the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, only days before President Obama is set to visit the country to repair a damaged relationship.\n\nWestphal was confirmed Wednesday night. Tom Malinowski, the nominee to become Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, has lingered in limbo after being nominated over 250 days ago.\n\nHaving quit his job as the Washington Director of Human Rights Watch, Malinowski now waits for the glacial pace of the new Senate confirmation process to put him back on the payroll. Meanwhile, the most senior position in the Obama administration for human rights remains vacant, while crises from Syria to Ukraine make the need for American advocacy on human rights more crucial than ever.\n\nPresident Obama gave a landmark speech Wednesday in Brussels, touting the American legacy of human rights and democracy promotion and prodding European countries to increase their advocacy for the downtrodden and defend Western values in the face of Russian aggression.\n\n\u201cI believe that over the long haul as nations that are free, as free people, the future is ours. I believe this not because I\u2019m naive. And I believe this not because of the strength of our arms or the size of our economies. I believe this because these ideals that we affirm are true. These ideals are universal,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd I believe that if we hold firm to our principles and are willing to back our beliefs with courage and resolve, then hope will ultimately overcome fear, and freedom will continue to triumph over tyranny, because that is what forever stirs in the human heart.\u201d\n\nThe speech was a call to action. But the human rights community sees a disconnect between the speech and the policies his administration has pursued since coming to office in 2009. There\u2019s hope that Obama might be turning over a new leaf in the wake of the Crimea invasion and could raise the priority of human rights and democracy promotion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping this speech will in fact mark an increase of attention emphasis and priority on these issues, which we haven\u2019t seen in the past five years,\u201d said David Kramer, who held the State Department human rights post during the Bush administration and now is the president of Freedom House. \u201cTom\u2019s nomination has sort of fallen through the cracks, which is particularly unfortunate considering the President\u2019s speech today. If we had Tom in place, he would in a position to take the lead on a lot of the issues.\u201d\n\nInside the State Department, there\u2019s a lot of frustration with the overall chaos that has become of the Senate confirmations process, ever since Majority Leader Harry Reid changed the rules to require only 50 votes to confirm a member of the administration. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has been using his power to slow the flow of confirmations to a trickle.\n\nBut each week, some nominations do get through. The process for choosing these lucky nominees is anything but democratic.\n\n\u201cMcConnell determines how many people go through every week and Reid determines who is on that list, in consultation with the White House,\u201d one administration official explained.\n\nSeveral officials and Senate aides told The Daily Beast that McConnell, Reid, and the White House had all agreed to let Malinowski get confirmed in this last round, but then the White House intervened to get Westphal on the list alongside four federal judges, at Malinowski\u2019s expense. Obama arrives Friday in Riyadh.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time an ambassador got to skip the line because a White House official was about to visit their country. Ambassador to Chile Mike Hammer got confirmed just before Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s trip there. Last week, the Senate confirmed Tim Broas to be ambassador to the Netherlands, just before Obama\u2019s trip to The Hague.\n\nA Senate Democratic leadership aide said that nominees are stalled at agencies all over the federal government and argued the overall problem was Republican intransigence.\n\n\u201cYou could write 140 different stories about nominees (including 32 ambassador nominations) that are pending because of Republican obstruction. Unfortunately Mr. Malinowski is one of many,\u201d the aide said. \u201cWe\u2019d vote on him tomorrow if Republicans agreed to drop the procedural roadblocks. We hope that the Republicans who support him will help get the rest of their team on board.\u201d\n\nA Republican leadership aide said that it was up to Reid when to schedule Malinowski for a vote. The State Department blamed the Senate overall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re determined to see Tom Malinowski confirmed very soon and we\u2019re confident his long wait is almost over. The only thing that stands in the way of his confirmation is the United States Senate,\u201d State Department Spokesman Alec Gerlach told The Daily Beast. \u201cSecretary Kerry has personally made the case that with so many pressing human rights issues on the agenda, and strong bipartisan support for Tom, it is urgent to get him confirmed.\u201d\n\nMalinowski has broad, bipartisan support, including the vocal support of some Republican senators, including John McCain and Lindsey Graham. He also has widespread support in the broader foreign policy and human rights communities in Washington. Over a dozen senior former officials from David Petraeus to Madeleine Albright wrote a letter last week to Reid and McConnell urging them to let Malinowski take up his post.\n\n\u201cMr. Malinowski\u2019s confirmation is particularly urgent given the number of challenges the United States faces in the world that are closely linked to issues of governance and human rights: the crisis in Crimea and Ukraine, the consolidation of authoritarian rule in Russia, and the continuing turmoil in Syria and elsewhere in the Arab World,\u201d they wrote. \u201cLeaving this position vacant handicaps our diplomacy in crucial areas and sends a deeply unfortunate message about our priorities in the world.\u201d\n\nDozens of leading NGOs and human rights organizations followed this week with a letter of their own. The human rights community is also engaged in an effort this week to persuade Obama to raise the issue of human rights while in Riyadh.\n\nAccording to the State Department\u2019s own human rights report for 2013, Saudi Arabia is guilty of massive and systematic human rights violations, including \u201c'citizens\u2019 lack of the right and legal means to change their government; pervasive restrictions on universal rights such as freedom of expression, including on the Internet, and freedom of assembly, association, movement, and religion; and a lack of equal rights for women, children, and noncitizen workers.\u201d\n\nThe White House declined to comment on why they chose to request the Senate confirm Obama\u2019s envoy to Saudi Arabia ahead of his lead official on human rights.\n\n\u201cWe are eagerly looking forward to Tom being confirmed and becoming part of the Administration,\u201d said Spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. \u201cAs we have made clear, time and again, that agenda is central to our foreign policy. It\u2019s what our history and values demand, and we know that our commitment to human rights and democracy reinforces our national security.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:18.192+0000"}
{"entityId": 1500, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "In the 1960s, Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley were having the same political arguments we\u2019re having today\u2014and had a lot more fun making them.\n\nIn Hillary Clinton\u2019s first economic policy speech this past week in New York, she tracked the income gap between the super-rich and middle class back 15 years. It\u2019s been going on way longer than that.\n\nI recently saw a preview of a fascinating documentary, Best of Enemies, about the 1968 political debates between the two original ideologues of our polarized cultural wars. William F. Buckley, a staunch Catholic, was then the leading light of the conservative movement. Gore Vidal, a cousin of Jackie Kennedy, was a brilliant novelist, playwright, and a scathing left-wing satirist. Way back then, Vidal raised the issue of \u201cincome disparity.\u201d He pointed to a statistic that was shocking fifty years ago. \u201cFive percent of Americans own twenty percent of the nation\u2019s wealth.\u201d\n\nThose were the good old days.\n\nToday, it\u2019s the top one percent of Americans who hold 22 percent of the nation\u2019s wealth. CNBC makes an even more startling prediction: By 2016, the combined wealth of the world\u2019s richest one percent could overtake that of the other 99 percent.\n\nWhen ABC-TV pitted the two patrician public intellectuals against each other in ten debates aired during the Republican and Democratic national conventions, audiences of 10 to 12 million couldn\u2019t get enough of Buckley and Vidal. TV news was never again the same bland comfort food swallowed by all Americans.\n\nWhat astonishes about the film, which opens at the end of this month, is how utterly recognizable are the opposite poles of American identity represented by these two men. This is where our culture wars began, and watching Vidal and Buckley do battle across so many fronts reminds us that culture and economics are in fact inextricably linked.. Where, oh where, are intellects like these today \u2013 courageous women and men who could strip the lying flesh off the financial manipulators, the climate deniers and the unrepentant bigots and birthers?\n\nBest of Enemies took producer-directors Morgan Neville and Robert Gordon five years to make, because investors couldn\u2019t believe that political debates held fifty years ago would be relevant to audiences of today. Wrong.\n\nIn language that was anything but politically correct, the rivals got down to the visceral level of what was bugging the public. The opposing political poles given voice by Buckley and Vidal excited the public, in much the same way that the unapologetic socialist Bernie Sanders and the raging egomaniac Trump do today.\n\nBuckley, with his intimidating lizard tongue flick, dismissed the poor as \u201cfreeloaders.\u201d Then he would pop a disarming smile like cubes from an ice tray to extol the virtues of free market capitalism. His wit made him mesmerizing to watch in well-chosen archival clips. Lowering himself to appear on \u201cLaugh In,\u201d he was rudely confronted by an audience member: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever stand up? Can\u2019t you think on your feet?\u201d\n\nBuckley gave his sideways sardonic smile. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stand up when you carry the weight of knowing so much.\u201d\n\nVidal, fleshy-lipped and sloe-eyed, came to the first debates prepared with pages of razor-sharp digs, but he led into them with seductive words that often caught his opponent off guard.\n\nWhat astonishes about the film, which opens at the end of this month, is how utterly recognizable are the opposite poles of American identity represented by these two men\n\nBy their tenth match in these heavyweight bouts of brainy blood sport, Vidal is calling Buckley a \u201ccrypto-Nazi.\u201d An enraged Buckley, who\u2019d fought in World War II, bares his pointy teeth to call Vidal a \u201cqueer\u201d \u2013 surfacing sexual orientation as a slur for the first time on national TV. Vidal had recently published a scandalous novel, \u201cMyra Breckenridge\u201d, which depicted the first transgender heroine. Buckley wound up warning the nonplussed Vidal: \u201cI\u2019ll sock you in the face and you\u2019ll stay plastered.\u201d\n\nBeyond Vidal\u2019s prescient mention of income disparity, he and his rival were not concerned with class warfare. Both were rich white men in a social stratum where wives or gay partners usually stayed home and planned dinner parties and hired nannies. Today, almost two-thirds of mothers with children under six are in the work force. But we\u2019re still arguing about all the \u201cculture war\u201d issues that broke out in the early 90s when the Clintons first ran as co-presidents and Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan used them as targets.\n\nThe polarization that has transformed American politics was dubbed the \u201cculture wars\u201d in 1991. A year later, Buchanan stunned the Republican National Convention with a speech claiming that the country was in a \u201creligious war for the soul of America.\u201d He would name abortion, sexual orientation, radical feminism, gun politics, and even clashes over the Confederate flag as \u201chot-button issues.\u201d\n\nAnd here we are, 35 years later, with a wider chasm than ever between \u201cprogressives\u201d and \u201cconservatives.\u201d Class warfare linked with the culture wars pit presidential candidates like Senator Ted Cruz \u2013who wants to abolish the IRS and let citizens fill out their taxes on a post card\u2014against Senator Bernie Sanders, who could easily comply, never having held a fulltime job before he entered politics at 40 and whose estimated net worth is $330,000.\n\n\u201cBill [Buckley] wouldn\u2019t have liked the Tea Party at all,\u201d says Neville. Buckley\u2019s greatest achievement was to cleanse the right from the John Birch Society and make it respectable, founding the National Review as its mouthpiece. \u201cThe swing of the pendulum [to the extreme right] began after 1980.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Hillary Clinton is way ahead of Republicans in recognizing the impact of our fast-spreading \u201cgig economy.\u201d Companies are continuing to cut full time jobs with benefits, and replacing them with freelancers and contract workers paid for piece work with no benefits. That\u2019s both positive and negative. It means lots more innovation in our economy by well-educated self-starters who make up today\u2019s growing entrepreneurial class.\n\nBut the \u201cEnd of Work,\u201d as The Atlantic has called it, also means the marginalization of many middle-class white and blue collar workers. Clinton sees that the economic mission of our times is to raise incomes for the vast majority of Americans so they can afford a middle-class life.\n\nHere\u2019s a stunning prediction by AARP\u2019s chief brand officer, Emilio Pardo: By 2020, more than 40 percent of Americans will be working as freelancers or entrepreneurs\u2014not as paid full-time workers with benefits.\n\nClinton fingered by name a few of the \u201ctrickle down\u201d troglodytes\u2014Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Marco Rubio\u2014who are still pushing policies from the old Reagan and George W Bush regimes that sank our country in national debt. As Hillary said, \u201cTwice now in the past 20 years, a Democratic president [Clinton and Obama] has had to come in and clean up the mess left behind\u201d from the Republican habit of cutting taxes for the rich and letting big corporations write their own rules.\n\nCorporate profits are soaring as paychecks continue to shrink. Clinton\u2019s solution is a new \u201cFairness Economy,\u201d starting with a resurgent movement of women into the American workforce. Over the past 40 years, she points out, working women pumped $3.5 trillion of growth into our economy. The U.S. used to rank 7th out of 24 countries in women\u2019s labor force participation. By 2013, we had sunk to 19th place. That engine of growth is seriously stalled.\n\nClinton promises to fight for fair pay and fair scheduling, paid family leave and earned sick days.

She cited \u201cbooks filled with unsubstantiated attacks against us, and they admit they have no evidence.\u201d\n\nAnd Clinton once again trotted out her creakily baroque defense of the private email server she used as secretary of state (in apparent contravention of Obama administration regulations), and the massive deletions she ordered upon leaving office.\n\nWidening her eyes and nodding at times like a bobblehead doll\u2014occasionally emitting a percussive laugh\u2014Clinton dodged one policy question after another, pretended Sanders barely exists, and proclaimed her \u201ctotal respect\u201d for the pesky press\u2014the same press that her campaign aides actually lassoed with ropes in the middle of a New Hampshire street to keep them away during a July 4th parade.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running my campaign for the press. I\u2019m running it for voters,\u201d Clinton explained to Keilar, an edge to her voice. That at least sounded truthful. But then Clinton added, with apparent insincerity: \u201cI totally respect the press, and what the press has to do.\u201d\n\n(What \u201cthe press has to do,\u201d in Clinton-speak, is not to serve as an information resource for the voters she wants to reach, but instead to pepper her with one-sided, irrelevant and exasperating queries that have nothing to do with the will of the people.)\n\nClinton begged off from revealing if she favors Sanders\u2019s call for higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations\u2014saying she isn\u2019t going to be addressing that issue until a scheduled speech on the economy next Monday.\n\nBeyond twitting the Republican candidates, especially her onetime friend and Senate campaign contributor Donald Trump, for their hostility to immigration reform and a path to citizenship, she had little to say about what she wants to do if elected president, instead taking refuge in processed answers about process.\n\nShe bragged about her campaign organization in Iowa, claiming an ardent supporter in each of the state\u2019s 1,600 precincts.\n\nOne of the few times Clinton took a firm stand\u2014under Keilar\u2019s tough but eminently fair interrogation\u2014was to support the proposal for a woman\u2019s face on U.S. currency, although she couldn\u2019t quite bring herself to say whether she believes it should be on the $10 bill or the $20 bill.\n\n\u201cI want a woman on the bill,\u201d she stoutly declared. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t like the idea that\u2019s a compromise\u2026and basically have two people on the bill\u2026That sounds pretty second-class to me.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, in the designated \u201clight\u201d section at the end of the interview, Clinton refused to say whether she prefers Amy Poehler or Kate McKinnon as her Saturday Night Live doppelganger.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m the best Hillary Clinton,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna be my own little self and keep going along and saying what I believe\u2026I\u2019m not looking for ratings.

The irony is that Obama isn\u2019t asking Congress for formal authorization.\n\nSen. James Inhofe will introduce a formal congressional authorization Tuesday for the use of American military force against ISIS using any means, including using boots on the ground, and in any country, including Syria. A copy of the legislation obtained by The Daily Beast follows the requirements of the War Powers Resolution, a law the White House is attempting to skirt and Congress is struggling to enforce.\n\nInhofe\u2019s \u2018\u2018Authorization for Use of Force Against the Organization Called the Islamic State\u2019\u2019 would grant Obama authority \u201cto use all necessary and appropriate force in order to defend the national security of the United States against the threat posed by the organization called the Islamic State (or \u2018IS\u2019), formally known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, as well as any successor organization.\u201d\n\nInhofe wants to get the resolution filed before Obama\u2019s Wednesday speech in which he has pledged to clarify the U.S. strategy to defeat ISIS, a strategy administration officials told reporters this week would involve three stages and take years to accomplish, probably more time than Obama has left in office.\n\nThe president and his staff have made clear that they don\u2019t feel they need congressional authorization to go after ISIS, but leaders in both parties disagree, and a long list of congressional figures believe the president must come to Congress for explicit authorization within 60 days of when he began striking ISIS in Iraq, on August 8.\n\nThe White House is using legal maneuvers, such as filing a new report under the War Powers Act for each individual set of strikes, to undermine the 60-day deadline and avoid any congressional vote of approval for Obama\u2019s ISIS war. There has been consultation with the Hill about the strikes but no cross-branch discussion about a legal authorization to underpin them.\n\nThe Oklahoma senator thinks his resolution could put pressure on the president to act and give him added flexibility to expand the ISIS war.\n\nEven Inhofe agrees with Obama that the president has the authority to act against ISIS under Article 2 of the Constitution, but the Oklahoma senator thinks his resolution could put pressure on the president to act and give him added flexibility to expand the ISIS war. The bill would require the administration to report to Congress about its ISIS strategy, a widely popular request since Obama acknowledged, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a strategy yet.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little chance the Senate will vote on any authorization bill for Obama\u2019s ISIS war before the election, because the administration doesn\u2019t want it, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid isn\u2019t interested in it, and just two weeks of legislative days remain before the next congressional recess.\n\nBut after the election, the issue could come up again in the lame-duck session, in which the Defense Authorization bill is sure to move. Inhofe, as the GOP head of the committee that controls that bill, is in a good position to influence its contents. Other senators also could try to add ISIS language to the defense bill before it passes in December.\n\nLawmakers who have written ISIS war authorization bills include Sen. Bill Nelson and Rep. Frank Wolf. A team of senators including John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, Tim Kaine, Chris Murphy, and Bob Corker have been working on a broader replacement for the 2001 authorization for the use of military force Congress passed after al Qaeda perpetrated the 9/11 attacks. That effort could be combined with the plans to assert Congress\u2019s role in overseeing the current anti-ISIS mission.\n\nBut not all Senate Republicans support holding a vote on authorizing Obama\u2019s ISIS war now. Graham told The Daily Beast on Monday it might do more to hinder the president than to help him.\n\n\u201cWhat if [Obama] comes here and [Congress] can\u2019t pass it?\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be a disaster. And what if you put so many conditions on it that it makes any military operations ineffective? That\u2019s what I worry about.\u201d\n\nIn his speech Wednesday, Obama is expected to lay out a three-stage strategy for eventually defeating ISIS. The first stage would be continuing the airstrikes in Iraq that are going on now. The second would begin soon and involve arming and training Iraqi forces, Kurdish forces, and maybe some Iraqi Sunni tribes. The last phase, which would take three years, would involve combating ISIS inside Syria, its primary base.\n\nSpeaking Sunday to Chuck Todd on Meet the Press, Obama made clear he doesn\u2019t think he needs Congress\u2019s sign-off for any of that. \u201cI do think it\u2019s important for Congress to understand what the plan is, to have buy-in, to debate it,\u201d he said.\n\nObama did seek congressional authorization when he decided to strike Syria in September 2013, before cancelling the strike at the last minute. \"While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,\" the president said at that time.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that there might not be a whole lot in the speech that administration officials haven\u2019t said before.\n\n\u201cWell, the speech isn\u2019t written yet. So I don\u2019t want to get ahead of describing a speech that hasn\u2019t been written yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t rule out that there might be something new in the speech.\u201d", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:20.417+0000"}

But there\u2019s a smarter way they can play defense.\n\nHere\u2019s an under-discussed reality of the new, Mitch McConnell-led Senate that\u2019s about to take over: The Senate Republican caucus is very likely to be far more conservative than anything we\u2019ve seen. Nine new Republican senators will swear their oaths of office. By my measurement, only one, West Virginia\u2019s Shelley Moore Capito, is what you\u2019d call a basic mainstream conservative. The other eight are varying degrees of out there.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s Thom Tillis ran against an even more extreme Tea Partier, so the media sometimes called him mainstream or even moderate, but as speaker of the state House he helped push through the radical-right agenda of Gov. Pat McCrory that led to the Moral Monday protests. The new senators from Louisiana and Arkansas are about what you\u2019d reckon. And then there are the people no one gave a thought to in October and November because their races weren\u2019t contested. But people like Nebraska\u2019s Ben Sasse and Montana\u2019s Steve Daines are going to be senators, and they ran with Tea Party backing.\n\nSo not only will the GOP have control in the Senate, it will move the center of gravity on Capitol Hill hard to starboard. What can the Democrats do?\n\nThe true answer is \u201cnot much.\u201d Forty-five seats, which they\u2019ll have, will give them enough to block stuff, but obviously nothing positive will be enacted. So Democrats will just have to play defense, mostly. But they need to play smart defense.\n\nTo me that means taking Chuck Schumer\u2019s recent advice, which I wrote about at the time.The Democrats have to get over their fear of defending government. The central distinguishing feature of this new Republican Congress will probably be that it\u2019s going to launch attacks on government across virtually all of its domestic functions: programs for the poor (and for the middle class, which Medicaid now basically is to a considerable extent); public investment in infrastructure and the like; regulation of all types, especially the environmental kind; and on and on and on. President Obama will veto most of it, but the Republicans will be happy to force every veto, confident that every manufactured showdown over government will be a win for them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like America developed an auto-immune disorder a few decades ago and we began attacking the vital organs of our democracy.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ll be confident of that for one reason: Recent history teaches us that the Democrats won\u2019t forcefully defend government. They\u2019ll say things like \u201cSuch-and-such Republican initiative goes too far.\u201d Most of them won\u2019t say it\u2019s just morally and practically wrong. That is what Democrats have to spend the next two years doing. And a certain presumed presidential candidate needs to be doing it, too.\n\nHappily, they\u2019re about to get some help. In that first column I wrote about Schumer\u2019s important speech in early December, I argued, as I often have, that it\u2019s infuriating that in all the sprawling liberal infrastructure of groups dedicated to every cause known to humanity, there was no group, none, devoted to the cause of defending the government.\n\nSince writing that column, I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019m not the only person in America who\u2019s been fretting about this black hole and about Democratic fecklessness when it comes to defending government. Dianne Stewart has been, too. That\u2019s how we\u2019re alike. But here\u2019s the difference between us. Whereas I\u2019ve been writing grumpy columns about the problem, arguing that someone ought to go out and raise the money to start a nonprofit group whose sole and explicit mission is the defense of government, Stewart, who has recently been the head of the liberal nonprofit group Public Works, went out and raised the money and did it. Her organization, to be called Indivisible, is starting to launch right now, and I think it\u2019s just what our discourse has needed and has sorely lacked. (The website, which as of now consists of just a homepage stating general principles, is indivisible.us.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like America developed an auto-immune disorder a few decades ago and we began attacking the vital organs of our democracy,\u201d Stewart told me just before Christmas. \u201cIndivisible is the antidote, helping Americans remember why we need healthy public institutions through which we can solve challenges we can\u2019t possibly tackle alone.\u201d\n\nWhat most impressed me in my chat with Stewart is that she sounded committed to the idea that this group and its work can\u2019t be stodgy but should be engaging, witty, edgy, and all the things one never associates with nonprofit political groups. I hope she\u2019s able to remain true to that vision, because as badly as this country needs this organization, a predictable approach would disserve the important task before the group in a really disappointing way.\n\nI believe that it is possible to make government interesting and appealing, and to surprise people with all that government does for them every day that they take for granted and just assume was the handiwork of the \u201cmore efficient\u201d private sector. Go to virtually any town of a decent size in the country, especially a college or university town where the research dollars flow, and the government is doing all kinds of good things people don\u2019t know about. Someone just has to tell them. Changing public opinion, of course, will be the work of a generation or maybe two, but kudos to Stewart for getting it started.\n\nIn the meantime, Democrats in the Senate need to find ways to take the right stands. When the Republicans come after the EPA, Democrats need to be ready to talk about all that the EPA has accomplished over the years\u2014the rivers and lakes made swimmable and fishable, the polluting power plants made cleaner, and all the rest. I never hear a Democrat talk about these goods, which are, in the literal sense, indivisible\u2014for us all.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:20.707+0000"}
{"entityId": 1505, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The right has a history of hyperventilating over social issues it doesn\u2019t like. But do recent critiques of Supreme Court decisions on gay marriage go too far?\n\nWhen the Supreme Court last week declined to rule on lower court rulings striking down bans on same-sex marriage, the familiar cries from the right over judicial activism were just the start. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee said he hoped state officials would defy the federal courts, and threatened to leave the Republican Party unless it did more to resist gay marriage. The dean of Liberty University\u2019s law school foresaw the \u201cend of western civilization.\u201d\n\nThen there was Matthew Franck at National Review, who described the series of marriage cases as \u201ca slow-motion Dred Scott for the 21st century.\u201d\n\nThat was a good way to get commentators\u2019 attention. Dred Scott v. Sandford was the decision that 1) entrenched slavery and 2) set the nation on a path to Civil War. Slavery and the Civil War having been more horrible than most things happening in America lately, libertarian lawyer/author Timothy Sandefur has proposed that comparisons to Dred Scott should trigger American law\u2019s version of the Internet\u2019s \u201cGodwin\u2019s Law\u201d under which whoever brings in Hitler has lost the argument.\n\nFollowing a storm of criticism, Franck dug in on the comparison in two further posts. It wasn\u2019t, he said, that he\u2019d meant to liken gay marriage to slavery\u2014critics were unreasonable to suggest any such thing. No, he\u2019d had in mind other parallels\u2014parallels, to be sure, that critics soon assailed as arbitrary and flimsy in the extreme\u2014of which the most interesting was his claim that the marriage rulings, like Dred Scott, pose a \u201ccomprehensive threat to republican government.\u201d\n\nNote what he\u2019s asserting here. It\u2019s one thing to object to a Supreme Court decision as restricting what laws the democratic process can make. That\u2019s what Supreme Court decisions do, at least when they recognize constitutional rights that curtail government power. (Conservatives, like liberals, have their favorite Court decisions that do this, on topics that include freedom of education, gun liberty, and freedom of campaign speech.) It\u2019s another thing to claim a given decision will make it impossible for republican government itself to function in the future in some sort of \u201ccomprehensive\u201d way.\n\nIt happens that Dred Scott is one of the very few Supreme Court decisions you could describe without hyperbole as doing this, since in a nation closely divided between slave and free, it entrenched the slave power in a way that tended to paralyze political action in general. In the cataclysm that followed, the survival of republican government indeed was in peril.\n\nSo will letting Rebecca and Rhonda get hitched paralyze republican governance in the United States in some similar way? Franck has not, as they say, spelled out a mechanism by which this could happen.\n\nBy his third post, Franck acknowledges that he might as easily have likened the marriage decisions to many other cases that legal scholars in the tradition of the late federal judge, law professor, and unsuccessful Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork have criticized as activist over the years, such as Lochner v. New York (striking down limits on working hours in bakeries) or Griswold v. Connecticut (striking down laws against contraceptives). Well, yes. Griswold was undeniably an incursion on democratic powers with a definite whiff of activism. But Griswold provoked only passing public controversy when handed down in 1965 and no significant movement has ever arisen to reverse it. Not the message Franck meant to send, I think.\n\nThere are few signs that most Americans on either side wish to enlist in the contemplated culture war.\n\nI suspect he chose the Dred Scott comparison precisely because of its overblown, grandiose nature. The American people cared so much about the principles raised in that case that they were willing to go to war over them. Today, by contrast, there are few signs that most Americans on either side wish to enlist in the contemplated culture war over these issues.\n\nEven as the ranks of culture warriors on the right diminish, their zeal seems to intensify. Indeed, the chatter for the past year on the anti-gay fringe has been of resistance. Pat Buchanan greeted last week\u2019s ruling with a call for \u201cmassive civil disobedience.\u201d Now that the rulings are reaching into core conservative states in the South and West, so goes the thinking, surely the American heartland will at last rise up and Do Something. What that something will be\u2014who it will hurt, and who will do the hurting\u2014remains somewhat vague.\n\nHuckabee, Buchanan, and their co-thinkers need to keep the rhetorical level up not because doing so will convince anyone in the middle, but because the warlike spirit might otherwise begin to flag among their own dwindling troops.\n\nWhere will they turn if it turns out there is no John Brown on the way, nor any Harper\u2019s Ferry raid to look forward to?", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:20.966+0000"}

In another, he stared down at ripped, tanned abs, dressed in nothing but American flag-printed swim trunks and sneakers.\n\n\u201cOlivia ... Thanks for emailing me about your interest in Advocare,\u201d the message began.\n\nFounded in 1993 by Charles E. Ragus, an insurance salesman who had worked for Herbalife, a nutrition company which may or may not be a Ponzi scheme, AdvoCare is a \u201cwellness\u201d brand that \u201cBuilds Champions \u00ae\u201d and is \u201cbacked by the latest science,\u201d according to its website. Ragus died in 2001, at 58. His obituary doesn\u2019t cite a cause.\n\nAdvoCare products, just like Herbalife, are not available for purchase in traditional stores, which is why they are successful: The goods are given to \u201cindependent Distributors,\u201d who then sell them to people they know, and if they recruit other people to hawk the products, they make a commission on their sales. This is technically called \u201cmulti-level marketing,\u201d but you may call it a gigantic scam.\n\nI had not, in fact, emailed Brown about my \u201cinterest in Advocare.\u201d I had contacted him to request an interview about his diet after he took to Facebook last week to tell the world about it.\n\nOn June 25, Brown wrote to his 300,000 fans (?) to \u201canswer a few questions that people have had about my recent weight loss.\u201d He explained that he and Gail realized they had gained weight and they decided to embark on a diet together. Luckily for them, Brown said, their son-in-law \u201cturned me onto a product called Advocare,\u201d which he claimed \u201cguaranteed\u201d a 15-pound weight loss in 24 days.\n\nBrown said he liked that it was \u201call natural\u201d and only cost him \u201cpretty short money, about $180 in total.\u201d\n\n\n\nBrown says the products helped him lose 42 pounds. He included two photos as proof: the same sunburned \u201cbefore\u201d picture, which appeared in my email, and a different \u201cafter\u201d photo: sinewy and tan in tight Spandex workout clothes, a triathlon medal around his neck and his thumb raised.\n\nHe encouraged people to talk to him about healthy living at scottbrowntri@gmail.com.\n\nIt was not supposed to end this way for Scott Brown, emailing strangers pictures of his pecs and waxing poetic about diet supplements.\n\nBrown rose to prominence in 2010, when he defied the odds of his long-shot Republican candidacy and won the special election to fill the Massachusetts Senate seat vacated by the death of Teddy Kennedy. Brown went from unknown to instant star, due almost entirely to the fact that, in 1982, he won Cosmopolitan\u2019s \u201cAmerica's Sexiest Man\u201d competition and posed nude in the June issue.\n\nBut Brown\u2019s Senate career would not last. In 2012, he was ousted by Democrat Elizabeth Warren. Two years later, he ran for the Senate again\u2014except this time, from New Hampshire. Dogged by charges of carpetbagging, he was narrowly defeated.\n\nAnd now he's in my inbox and who knows how many other inboxes without a shirt.\n\n\u201cI am here to help you get started,\u201d Brown\u2019s email read. \u201cAs you can see from my story and pictures, these products from Advocare really do work.\u201d\n\nIt was not supposed to end this way for Scott Brown, emailing strangers pictures of his pecs and waxing poetic about diet supplements.\n\n\n\nBrown went on to say that \u201cas a fitness advocate\u201d (he\u2019s competed in half a dozen triathlons) \u201cI am very skeptical about many products out there,\u201d but his son-in-law, Keith, \u201cused Advocare products through his 8 year professional baseball career\u201d and that was enough to convince him to jeopardize his well-being for vanity.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re ready to get your health back on track,\u201d Brown said, \u201callow Keith and me to get you signed up today!\u201d\n\nBrown is offering me the following: \u201c20-40% off products\u201d if I become an AdvoCare distributor; \u201cNutrition and Fitness guidance to maximize your results\u201d; and \u201cproduct regimens to help you reach your goals.\u201d\n\nIn the comment section of Brown\u2019s Facebook post, he wrote, \u201cFYI I'm not a paid spokesman for them. Neither is Gail,\u201d and in a separate post, two hours after the initial post, he reiterated, \u201cJust as an update which I put out as a comment on the original post, neither Gail nor I are paid spokesrepresentatives for Advocare [sic].\u201d He added, \u201cSome of you have to relax a little bit. Go for a nice bike ride or something.

{"entityId": 1507, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "For a not-insignificant portion of the online right, a new form of white nationalism is taking root\u2014and it coincides with the rise of Donald Trump.\n\nThe newfangled slur \u201ccuckservative\u201d\u2014a portmanteau which combines the word\u202c \u201ccuckold\u201d (which has both sexual and racial overtones) with the word \u201cconservative\u201d\u2014has been gaining steam online these last few days.\u202c So much so that, the other day, it\u202c reached a threshold where I felt it warranted comment. So I did, and that\u2019s when the fun began.\n\nWho knows when these things reach a tipping point? But this new term\u2014typically employed in defense of Donald Trump\u2014was especially seedy. The danger is that otherwise well-meaning grassroots conservatives might mistakenly think\u202c this term, which, at best, is meant to be emasculating, was merely an\u202c anodyne synonym for RINO. Instead, it\u2019s a rallying cry for white supremacists and \u201cneoreactionaries\u201d who, for whatever reason, seem to back Trump.\n\nAt least, although I had seen it bandied about in the\u202c fever swamps of Twitter before, its mainstreaming (to the degree it has been mainstreamed) seems to have coincided with the rise of \u202c Trump as a political force. I\u2019m not suggesting he\u2019s behind it\u2014just that his comments about Mexicans being rapists might have awakened an unsavory crowd, and that they\u2019re falling for him in a major way.\n\nAnd there were two mentions by prominent\u202c conservatives that led me to believe this was about to start trending.\u202c First, on Wednesday, Rush Limbaugh averred\u202c that \u201cIf Trump were your average, ordinary, cuckolded Republican, he\u202c would have apologized by now.\u201d\n\nThe next day, conservative blogger and\u202c talk radio host Erick Erickson noticed the term, which he, to his\u202c credit, dismissed as \u201ca slur against Christian voters coined by\u202c white supremacists.\u201d\u202c\n\nIn any event, it was after posting my Daily Caller blog about this\u202c that the white supremacists came out in force. It seems that, according to several\u202c bloggers and people on Twitter (many of whom have Confederate flag\u202c avatars),\u202c by virtue of writing this piece, I had outed myself as a\u2026cuckservative. (And\u202c so had Erick Erickson for speaking out against the slur.)\n\nI also began to learn some\u202c interesting facts about who is and who isn\u2019t a cuckservative. Did you know that a Jewish conservative cannot\u202c be a cuckservative? Neither\u202c did I. Gentile support for Israel, on the other hand, is a defining\u202c trait. It turns out that supporting Israel (or immigration reform, or probably criminal justice reform) is tantamount to your wife getting pregnant by another man\u2014and then you\u202c supporting that child.\n\nIf this all sounds very base and evil and\u202c primitive, that\u2019s because it is.\n\nBut I don\u2019t want to stop with just discussing the etymology of the\u202c term, and the story of how I was personally impacted. I think it\u2019s\u202c worth digging a bit deeper and exploring why this became a \u201cthing\u201d\u2014and why it\u2019s important to confront what it represents.\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that we on the center-right have been defending ourselves and our movement against charges of racism for so long that we\u2019ve forgotten that, well, our side has some racists.\n\nThe fundamental worldview behind the slur, it seems, is one of\u202c tribalism. I suspect this is a reaction to the economic displacement and riots and\u202c chaos and the general unease and malaise that has permeated America\u202c for what seems like an eternity now. Sadly, we\u2019re seeing the rise of\u202c this on both sides of the political spectrum. And on the fringe right, we\u2019re seeing a philosophy that says whites\u202c should stick together.\u202c\n\nAs a conservative who believes in such quaint things as the rule of\u202c law\u2014and a colorblind and a pluralistic society (I know, I\u2019m such a\u202c rube!), this all disgusts me. Here\u2019s an insight into the thinking of these anti-cuckservatives, which comes from an open\u202c letter to yours truly: \u201cIt\u2019s\u202c perfectly okay for every race and ethnic group on the planet to look\u202c out for their own interests, love their own people, have their own\u202c borders (or at least wish for independent statehood), and want to\u202c perpetuate a better future for their children\u2026except Whites.\u201d\u202c\n\n\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, conservative ideas are the best ideas for\u202c helping everyone flourish\u2014regardless of race or religion. But, then\u202c again, I\u2019m not a white supremacist\u2014I\u2019m a cuckservative!\u202c\n\nI also think Erickson is on to something when he talks about his\u202c faith. This kind of cynical tribalism doesn\u2019t just thrive in a world\u202c based on scarcity and fear (which is the opposite of faith), but it\u2019s\u202c also contrary to all the teachings of Christ. As a rising leader of\u202c the conservative movement, kudos to Erickson for demonstrating moral\u202c courage here.\n\nSometimes people rise to the occasion, and I think it\u2019s notable that we now have people who made their names as big RINO-hunters\u2014that is, the bloggers and pundits who made their name attacking Republican moderates and movement sellouts\u2014are now, for the first time I\u2019ve seen, actively trying to police the far right. Conservatives are waking up to the fact that the racists on our side need to be killed with fire.\n\nThe other positive thing is that, in response to this, several mainstream\u202c conservatives have begun appropriating the term, embracing\u202c it for comedic purposes, and thus, taking away the power of using it\u202c in a derogatory manner. We are all cuckservatives now.\u202c\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that we on the center-right have been defending ourselves and our movement against charges of racism for so long that we\u2019ve forgotten that, well, our side has some racists. \u201cThe truth is, there are always racists in the movement, or, not even in the movement, actually, as they tend to be outside of the movement, but there are racists adjacent to the movement, always hoping and pushing the conservative movement to become what they think it really should be, a champion of the White Race and Protector of Peoples of European Descent, or whatever they\u2019re calling it this week,\u201d is how the conservative blogger Ace of Spades put it last week.\n\nSo these\u202c people have always been around. But whereas they were once confined to\u202c the nether regions of the Internet, now Twitter allows them to spread\u202c their pernicious message, and Trump has given them a candidate to get behind. This might make them seem more powerful than\u202c they really are, but I do worry that this white nationalism business is starting to take off\u2014that\u202c it\u2019s not just the term \u201ccuckservative\u201d that\u2019s being mainstreamed.\n\nI\u202c fear that more people on both ends of the political spectrum are\u202c embracing what should be fringe\u202c views in America. I can\u2019t police the left, but my hope in writing this\u202c is to sound the alarm on the right. And message is simple: Be\u202c optimistic about America. Embrace our pluralistic society. And don\u2019t let these vile goddamn racists pollute our message. They are not our friends, they are not on our team, and conservative leaders must roundly condemn them.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:21.933+0000"}

But those rules weren\u2019t in place when she\u2019s alleged to have broken them.\n\nIt looks bad for Hillary Clinton\u2014again. This New York Times story alleging that she might have violated federal rules by using a personal email account instead of an official government one for her communications seems to raise all the old questions about Clintonian corner-cutting and is sure to make Democrats flail their arms and cry, \u201cOh God, this again?\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s hold on a second. A close reading of the Times piece reveals one potential big hole in the case. I\u2019m not saying the Times is wrong here. It\u2019s still a foggy situation. I am, however, saying this: You have to know how to read these things, and if you do know how to read them, there\u2019s a big question here that could\u2014potentially\u2014exonerate Clinton to some or maybe even a considerable extent.\n\nThe article says that there were \u201cnew\u201d regulations that Clinton was supposed to abide by. It notes that one past secretary of state, Colin Powell, who served from 2001 to 2005, sometimes used his personal email account \u201cbefore the new regulations went into effect.\u201d\n\nSo, a key question would seem to be this: When did the new regulations go into effect? If 2007 or 2008, then Clinton would appear to be in direct violation of them, depending on what precisely they said. If later, it gets a little murkier.\n\nOddly, the Times article doesn\u2019t say. It doesn\u2019t pin the new regs down to a specific date or even year.\n\nNow, I know enough about reporting to know how this works. If you\u2019ve got an airtight case, then you lay it all out there. You include the date. Indeed you emphasize the date, you put it high up in your story. The fact that it\u2019s not in there is a little fishy.\n\nWell, this might be the explanation: The new regs apparently weren\u2019t fully implemented by State until a year and half after Clinton left State. Here\u2019s the timeline: Clinton left the State Department on February 1, 2013. Back in 2011, President Obama had signed a memorandum directing the update of federal records management. But the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) didn\u2019t issue the relevant guidance, declaring that email records of senior government officials are permanent federal records, until August 2013. Then, in September 2013, NARA issued guidance on personal email use.\n\nSo if these new regulations went into effect after she left State, then what rule did she violate, exactly?\n\nA senior State Department official emailed me to say that \u201cin October 2014, a Department-wide notice was sent out which explained each employee\u2019s responsibilities for records management. Consistent with 2013 NARA guidance, it included instructions that generally employees should not use personal email for the transaction of government business, but that in the very limited circumstances when it is necessary, all records must be forwarded to a government account or otherwise preserved in the Department\u2019s electronic records systems.\u201d\n\nSo if these new regulations went into effect after she left State, then what rule did she violate, exactly? And, if this is true, why did the Times not share this rather crucial piece of information with its readers? No one could possibly argue that this fact isn\u2019t germane to the story. It\u2019s absolutely central to it. Why would the Times leave it out?\n\nHere are a few other specifics surrounding this matter that the Times article doesn\u2019t make clear. These facts are already making the rounds on the Internet:\n\n1. Clinton was not the first Secretary to use a private email account. In fact, John Kerry is the first Secretary to use \u201ca standard government email address,\u201d according to The Washington Post.\n\n2. Clinton turned over her emails to the State Department. It\u2019s not clear whether her predecessors did the same.\n\n3. The Times article says the \u201cexistence of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s personal email account was discovered by a House committee investigating the attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi.\u201d This is incorrect. Gawker reported this first, in March 2013.\n\n4. At the time Clinton was Secretary, the Federal Records Act didn\u2019t require federal employees to use government accounts, only to preserve records of their communications. This, Clinton seems to have done.\n\nSo what, exactly, did she do wrong here? Maybe something\u2014I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s totally in the clear. She and her people still should answer the question: Why no government email address at all? What would have been the good and straightforward reason for not having one? It\u2019s a little too early to know exactly what the facts are, and how culpable Clinton is here of any possible wrongdoing. But of course it\u2019s not too early for people to read the Times story and start making noise about a \u201cpattern\u201d of Clinton behavior that this falls into.\n\nMaybe. But this seems like a good time to remember another pattern of behavior: namely, that of the Times. I remember clear as a bell reading that initial Jeff Gerth story on Whitewater back in March 1992. It seemed devastating. But on top of it, media and political operators hostile to the Clintons piled all sorts of phony accusations that took millions of dollars and many years to unravel. When it was all over, courts both literal and of public opinion found that the Clintons did nothing wrong on Whitewater -- except to be na\u00efve enough to let themselves be lured into a money-losing venture by Jim McDougal.\n\n\n\nIf they had done something wrong, with all the prosecutorial firepower thrown at them by a prosecutor (Ken Starr) who clearly hated them, don\u2019t you think they\u2019d have been indicted? Of course they would have been. But Starr couldn\u2019t turn anything up on Whitewater and was about to close down his investigation empty-handed until he got wind of a gal named Monica.\n\nSo that\u2019s a pattern too. The Times, for those with short memories, has never loved the Clintons. Remember Howell Raines and his ceaseless, thundering editorials against them. And today, it smells like the Times may have been rolled by the Republican staff of the Benghazi panel. And hey, great work by them and Chairman Trey Gowdy to use the nation\u2019s leading liberal newspaper in this way.\n\nClinton still has some questions to answer, two that I can think of: Why did she not take a state.gov address? And is the Times accurate in writing that \u201cher aides took no actions to have her personal emails preserved on department servers at the time, as required by the Federal Records Act\u201d? If she can\u2019t put forward persuasive answers to these two questions, then there may still be something here.\n\nBut the Times has some questions to answer to: Did you know that the new regs went into effect after Clinton left office? And if you didn\u2019t, why not? And if you did, why did you leave that fact out of the story? One can imagine Clinton coming up with decent answers to her questions, but it\u2019s kind of hard to see how the Times can.\n\nUPDATE 3/24/15: This story has been updated to more accurately reflect what was in the original 1992 Times article about Whitewater.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:22.682+0000"}

It feels like it was yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were just kids,\u201d Mitchell smilingly agreed.\n\nSitting opposite each other in a studio done up to look like some garish real estate mogul\u2019s ostentatious living room, nearly swallowed up by humongous white chairs, they were so close together that their shoes occasionally touched.\n\nApparently these two women of the same generation know each other pretty well\u2014Mitchell covered Clinton at the State Department\u2014and not just on a professional basis. After all, Mitchell\u2019s husband is Alan Greenspan, who was chairman of the Federal Reserve during the Bill Clinton presidency and a frequently consulted economic policy adviser.\n\nSo the candidate seemed unfazed even when Mitchell was asking if she wished to \u201capologize to the American people\u201d for the email screw-up. (Not really; unless \u201cI am sorry this has been confusing to people\u201d constitutes an apology).\n\nShe did, of course, repeatedly express regret, in a seemingly more heartfelt manner than her earlier pro-forma expressions of regret, for making such a lousy\u2014and politically damaging\u2014choice concerning her electronic communications.\n\nOne listens to her Jesuitical contortions about what was permitted or not permitted, what was marked classified and what was not, or which of her predecessors did nearly the same thing, with growing numbness and boredom\u2014as good a strategy as any, perhaps Clinton believes, to get her past this controversy.\n\nThe one moment when Clinton really herniated my credulity was when Mitchell asked about the private server: \u201cDid anyone in your inner circle say, \u2018This isn\u2019t such a good idea. Let\u2019s not do this\u2019\u201d?\n\nAnd the candidate responded: \u201cYou know, I was not thinking a lot when I got in. There was so much work to be done. We had so many problems around the world. I didn\u2019t really stop and think what kind of email system will there be? I just didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTo state the obvious, if Secretary of State Clinton actually hadn\u2019t given any thought to her emailing methods, then she would have done the easiest thing and used her government account. What\u2019s more, it is simply hard to believe that this image-parsing, outwardly scrupulous public official\u2014a self-described \u201cpolicy wonk\u201d who never saw a heap of details she didn\u2019t dive into\u2014\u201cdidn\u2019t really stop and think what kind of email system will there be.\u201d\n\nThat said, Clinton clearly appreciated that the barrage of email questions\u2014including her scheduled October 22 appearance (\u201cgrueling,\u201d as she expects it to be) before the Republican-run House committee investigating Benghazi and other missteps\u2014constitutes a door she must walk through, however painfully, in order to arrive at the White House.\n\nClinton took every opportunity to pivot to her core issues such as income inequality and championing the middle class. Although we are supposedly in the midst of an election cycle in which pissed-off voters are resonating to candidates who channel populist rage but otherwise don\u2019t seem to know a whole lot about much of anything, some might ultimately find Clinton\u2019s calculated and policy-heavy rhetoric reassuring if not particularly exciting.\n\nHer attempts to humanize herself\u2014playing along with a \u201clightning round\u201d in which she complained of sleep deprivation, admitted to a yen for chocolate, and revealed that she prefers, yes, emailing to texting\u2014seemed a tad contrived, though the contrivance was Mitchell\u2019s, not Clinton\u2019s.\n\nWhen Mitchell asked about Donald Trump, and his attacks on Clinton\u2019s closest aide, Huma Abedin, the candidate replied: \u201cWell, he\u2019s attacked so many people\u2026From great basketball players to people who express different opinions from him. I think it\u2019s an unfortunate development in American politics\u2014that his campaign is all about who he\u2019s against, whether it\u2019s immigrants or women broadcasters or aides of other candidates.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI also believe the president of the United States does have to be careful about what he or she says. You know, I do know sometimes people say, well, I\u2019m careful about what I say. That\u2019s because for more than 20 years I\u2019ve seen the importance of the president of the United States, the leader not only of our nation, but of the world, having to send messages that will be received by all kinds of people. Loose talk, threats, insults\u2014they have consequences. So I\u2019m going to conduct myself as I believe is appropriate for someone seeking the highest office in our country.\u201d\n\nThat was one of Clinton\u2019s better moments.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:23.514+0000"}

Perry is trying to claim the faux moral high ground here by arguing that he held out for a more substantive meeting and got it, but come on. It\u2019s not as if that meeting wouldn\u2019t have happened if the governor had shown up on the runway. What exactly does Obama get out of a public handshake with a hard-right, not that bright, confusingly optometrized Texas Republican?\n\nThis might be a paragraph you can wave in my face on January 21, 2017, and God knows I\u2019ve written a number of them, but: Rick Perry ain\u2019t never gonna be president. We\u2019ve been watching him on the national stage for a while now. Forget the third thing he forgot. The problem is that his instincts are wrong, his timing is bad, his hand is heavy. Accusing the White House of orchestrating a \u201ccoordinated effort\u201d to help the movement of tens of thousands of children? That\u2019s just Tea Party nonsense. He\u2019s a guitarist who never knows what notes not to play. Now, guitarists like that have fans, sometimes millions of them. But they don\u2019t ascend the plinth of greatness. He just has \u201cgovernor but nothing more\u201d written on his face.\n\nNow let\u2019s turn to the guy who did ascend the plinth, at least in terms of becoming president. What is he doing on this issue of the immigrant children? They were asking on Hardball Tuesday night whether this might be Obama\u2019s Katrina. We\u2019ve had a string of little crises that were all supposed to be Obama\u2019s Katrina, and they\u2019ve mostly been jokes. Slate\u2019s Dave Weigel counted up nine of \u2019em. It\u2019s been silly. But somehow, this one didn\u2019t ring so false to me when Matthews et al were discussing it Tuesday night.\n\nFor one thing, there is the specific parallel of the flyover: Obama was going to Texas for a fundraiser but wasn\u2019t planning on going to the border? I usually try to ask myself what I\u2019d be saying if a Republican did X, and if a Republican did that, I\u2019d be teeing off. It\u2019s not defensible.\n\nSecond, Obama is at a really vulnerable point in his presidency, I think, not dissimilar to the point George W. Bush was at in August 2005, when Katrina hit. Then, Bush\u2019s approval rating was generally in the mid-40s, as Obama\u2019s is now. Hanging on, but vulnerable to one straw that could break the camel\u2019s back. Obama is in that place now. And this is pretty far afield, but keep an eye on Aleppo in Syria. Aleppo has been a stronghold of the more legitimate opposition to Bashar al-Assad. It might be about to fall to Assad\u2019s forces. This, two weeks after Obama announced a big aid package for the moderate rebels. Syria is Obama\u2019s biggest foreign policy failure\u2014he should have delivered that $500 million to those forces long ago, but he delayed. When Assad\u2019s recapture of Aleppo is consummated, Obama is going to look played again.\n\nWould it be too much for Obama to go to one of these horrid shelters and read these children a story? Kick a soccer ball with them? Would that really kill him in the polls?\n\nThat delaying is a pattern. I don\u2019t understand it. I covered New York mayors. When a crisis hits, you go. If it\u2019s 3 in the fucking morning and way out in some part of Staten Island you\u2019ve never even heard of, you go. Obama should have been in Texas or California or Arizona last week.\n\nBut saying what? That\u2019s the problem. If we lived in a better country, we\u2019d take these kids in. It\u2019s obscene that we don\u2019t. Used by jackals, no life to go back to at all. Yes, I guess we can\u2019t encourage 200,000 or 300,000 to come. But we could at least be housing them in circumstances better than 20 of them sharing one toilet. It\u2019s disgusting and makes me ashamed, and it should you.\n\nBut Obama is the last person in America who can say that. He\u2019d be pilloried. Maybe impeached (reason, what, five, to the right?). And that tells us what\u2019s really tragic about this crisis. We have a political system that not only can\u2019t solve this particular crisis, it is virtually guaranteed never to solve it. That\u2019s almost all the Republicans\u2019 fault. Anything that embarrasses Obama they\u2019re going to play up, of course, but it\u2019s also the raging xenophobia of their base.\n\nStill, this is the kind of situation where the people who voted for Obama want him to do...something. They understand the political constraints. They know he can\u2019t do a lot. But a Pope Francis-esque gesture of some kind: As the pope washed the feet of women, would it be too much for Obama to go to one of these horrid shelters and read these children a story? Kick a soccer ball with them? Would that really kill him in the polls? Most liberals aren\u2019t unrealistic, contrary to what you normally read. But they want to see little manifestations of courage from the man they voted for. This is a prime moment for exactly that.\n\nI think the White House in these circumstances underestimates the American people. The American people, thank God, aren\u2019t right-wing bigots and blowhards. They\u2019re actually pretty decent. You just have to find that yin of decency and locate the gestures and words that smother the yang of fear. It can be done. The media poke fun at \u201chope,\u201d but what hope meant was that many Americans just wanted Obama to be able to do that\u2014to say to the world, \u201cWe are this generous people, not that fearful people.\u201d It didn\u2019t, and still doesn\u2019t, seem too much to ask.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:23.763+0000"}

The congressman says Chris Christie proved them right.\n\nNew Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone said Republicans in Washington may have been right to vote against federal aid for Hurricane Sandy relief in late 2012 because they worried the money would be mishandled.\n\nRepresentative Pallone called the Christie administration\u2019s handling of federal relief \u201cdisturbing\u201d outside of a union hall in Wall Township, New Jersey Sunday. Pallone was there with Senator Cory booker to accept his nomination for a fourteenth term in Congress from Monmouth County Democrats.\n\nAs he chomped on an apple, Pallone explained to The Daily Beast: \u201cWhen we were trying to get the money for Sandy, part of the opposition that was coming from the Western and Southern states was that they claimed the money would go down a rat hole and be mismanaged.\u201d\n\nPallone said it was embarrassing \u201cthat it actually happened\u201d like those Republicans said it would. \u201cI have to go back to the very people who said \u2018I didn\u2019t want to vote for this because it wasn\u2019t going to be managed properly\u2019 now that they\u2019ve been proven right.\u201d Pallone took a bite of his apple. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad.\u201d\n\nThe road to recovery after Hurricane Sandy has been bumpy from the beginning.\n\nIn late January 2013, Congress finally approved a $50 billion emergency relief package for storm victims of after weeks of Republican opposition. Many Republicans who voted against doling out federal aid\u2014like the 67 in the House who opposed allotting $9.7 billion to help pay flood insurance\u2014represented districts which had received aid after Hurricane Katrina. Others, like Susan Brooks and Steve King, had received campaign support from Governor Christie while on the trail, making the \u201cno\u201d vote something of a personal betrayal in the governor\u2019s eyes.\n\nLast May, the Christie administration entered into an $86 million, three-year contract with Louisiana-based Hammerman and Gainer Inc. to distribute relief funds to New Jersey residents.\n\nPrior to winning the contract, HGI\u2019s New Jersey law firm, Capehart Scatchard, made a $25,000 contribution to the Republican Governors Association, which in turn contributed nearly $2 million to Christie\u2019s reelection campaign and of which Christie now serves as chairman.\n\nHGI faced criticism for their performance, and in December, the Christie administration quietly terminated their contract. The governor did not address the company\u2019s firing until late February, saying \u201cwe had fundamental disagreements about how this should be done\u2026we\u2019re moving on to another contractor. This happens all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHGI was a disaster,\u201d Palone said, \u201cI asked, several months ago, HUD to investigate HGI and see what happened to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again\u2026From what I can see [HGI was] not replaced, and the state is simply now handling the second round [of funding] on their own, without a contract\u2026I think they are [trying to settle] with HGI for $10 million. So, if they settle, the state would probably just lose $10 million.\u201d\n\nPallone explained that he was not sure why HGI was hired in the first place, \u201cthey were a disaster from the beginning, HGI! I don\u2019t know the circumstances, whether [hiring them] was political, or what the circumstances were. I didn\u2019t know much about them at first, so I didn\u2019t realize what the problems were, but gradually, they became manifested as more and more people came into our [congressional] office and said they were having problems.\u201d\n\nIn January, Pallone and fellow Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell sent a letter to HUD, asking them to investigate both the hiring and firing of HGI. \u201cWe fought too hard for these federal disaster recovery dollars to stand by while they are recklessly mismanaged,\u201d the congressmen wrote. They asked for HUD to appoint an official to monitor the distribution of recovery funds in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little transparency, and that\u2019s the problem,\u201d Pallone said. \u201cWe met with the DCA [Department of Community Affairs] commissioner [Richard Constable]. He said that they were trying to make improvements in the second round of funding. But I remain skeptical, and that\u2019s why I think HUD has to get involved, to make sure there\u2019s oversight.\u201d\n\nOversight might help answer questions many New Jersey residents are asking: Like why Christie funneled $6 million in Sandy funds to the development of a senior center in Belleville (not a particularly storm-ravaged place), fulfilling a plan that was in the works for years prior to the hurricane. Coincidentally, the plan to distribute the money to the town was announced just two weeks before Belleville\u2019s Democratic mayor endorsed Christie for reelection.\n\nPallone himself asked another Sandy question. Why \u201cpeople were told, when the storm occurred\u2026\u2018Go ahead and repair your home, do what you have to do. Apply for grants apply for loans'\u2026Now, when they try to get reimbursement for the work they\u2019ve done, they\u2019re told they\u2019re not going to get reimbursed?\u201d Pallone told The Daily Beast: \u201cwe want to make sure [HUD] say[s] to the Christie administration \u2018we want to make are you know exactly how to do this.\u2019 There are just so many people who come into our [district] office and don\u2019t know where they stand. They were denied [help], and they shouldn\u2019t have been.\u201d\n\nLast week, PEER, a nonprofit environmental watchdog group, concluded that Christie\u2019s proposal for additional recovery aid \u201cconflicts with its own announced projects, ignores known threats, and contains numerous flaws.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:24.252+0000"}

The Trump confidant also bragged to The Daily Beast about how he \u201cdestroy[ed]\u201d the life of a young beauty queen\u2014a woman Cohen called an \u201cidiot.\u201d\n\nThe ultra-aggressive tactics of Trump and his inner circle have raised questions about the GOP front-runner\u2019s character and judgment. Fellow Republican candidate Rick Perry called on Trump to drop out of the race after he questioned the heroism of former prisoner of war Senator John McCain. The Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, called Cohen\u2019s comments \u201cdespicable,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is a new low. Rape is rape. Full stop. End of story.\u201d\n\n\n\nTeam Trump\u2019s attitude towards female opponents has, at times, been particularly hostile. Legal papers revealed by The New York Times this week showed that Trump called a female attorney\u2014and new mother\u2014\u201cdisgusting\u201d after she took out her breast pump and said she needed to take a break from their deposition. On Wednesday, Trump doubled down on the remarks, calling the lawyer a \u201cvicious, horrible person.\u201d\n\nUntil Tuesday, when Donald Trump distanced himself from Cohen following his inaccurate remarks about spousal rape in The Daily Beast, the former Democrat had been one of his boss\u2019s most vocal public supporters, appearing on cable news shows to act as a surrogate for Trump and defend the campaign against the real estate mogul\u2019s more controversial claims including that Mexicans crossing the border are murderers and rapists and the insinuation that Senator John McCain\u2019s five years in captivity during the Vietnam War made him less of a hero.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s speaking for himself. He\u2019s not speaking for me, obviously,\u201d Trump said of Cohen on CNN.\n\nA campaign manager offered further clarification: \u201cMichael Cohen is a corporate employee and is not affiliated with the campaign in any way.\u201d\n\nThough threatening perceived enemies with lawsuits is a go-to response for Trump\u2014the plutocrat is particularly rankled by claims he is less wealthy than he claims to be\u2014the 2016 Republican front-runner often makes good. To prove his point during the call, Cohen invoked what he claimed were successful suits past like the recent $500 million suit against Spanish-language TV channel Univision after it decided not to air the Miss USA pageant following Trump\u2019s incendiary remarks about Mexican immigrants. But it\u2019s Trump\u2019s win over a beauty pageant contestant that Cohen seems to relish most.\n\n\u201cDo you want to destroy your life? It\u2019s going to be my privilege to serve it to you on a silver platter like I did that idiot from Pennsylvania in Miss USA, because I think you\u2019re dumber than she is,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cSheena Monnin, another one that wanted to defame Mr. Trump and ended up with a $5 million judgment. That\u2019s going to be nothing compared to what I do to you.\u201d\n\nSheena Monnin\u2019s father, Philip Monnin, told The Daily Beast that Cohen treated her with \u201carrogance and bullying and threats and intimidation\u2026delivered with basic impunity.\u201d The 30-year-old former Miss Pennsylvania (Favorite song: \u201cMemory\u201d from the musical Cats; Hobbies: geology and studying rock formations) resigned her title in 2012 after failing to make the top 16 in the national pageant. She was subsequently hit with a $5 million defamation penalty in arbitration for questioning the integrity of the pageant\u2019s results.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like it\u2019s their right that they can do this and treat people this way,\u201d Philip Monnin said.\n\nNeither Cohen nor the Trump campaign responded to requests for comment for this article.\n\n\u201cDo you want to destroy your life? It\u2019s going to be my privilege to serve it to you on a silver platter like I did that idiot from Pennsylvania in Miss USA, because I think you\u2019re dumber than she is.\u201d\n\nPhilip Monnin said that his daughter reached a settlement with the Miss USA organization in 2014 and no longer speaks publicly about the lawsuit. (She may be barred from speaking by a gag order.)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019s moved on with her life. She\u2019s not had to rescind what she said,\u201d he added.\n\nCourt records show the judgment against Monnin was satisfied in August 2014.\n\nWhat she said was this: While backstage at rehearsal for the Miss USA pageant, another contestant told her she had seen a list of the top five finalists. When those five names were indeed called, she said she knew the competition had been rigged from the start.\n\nSo Monnin resigned her title and took to Facebook, posting in part: \u201cIn good conscience I can no longer be affiliated in any way with an organization I consider to be fraudulent, lacking in morals, inconsistent, and in many ways trashy.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Monnin cited the organization\u2019s recent decision to allow transgender women to compete as a reason for her resignation.\n\nTrump responded quickly, appearing on Good Morning America to announce his intent to sue the ex-beauty queen and lobbing an insult for good measure: \u201cShe lost and she\u2019s angry about losing. And frankly, in my opinion, I saw her barely a second and she didn\u2019t deserve to be in the top 15.\u201d\n\nMichael Cohen called into TMZ to give her a public ultimatum: Apologize and retract her claim that the pageant results were predetermined, or face a defamation lawsuit seeking \u201cmassive damages.\u201d\n\nHe gave her 24 hours. When asked by host Harvey Levin about the size of the intended lawsuit (\u201cHow much money are you gonna get from somebody who works at the Sunglass Hut?\u201d) Cohen said, \u201cIt\u2019s not about the money. You understand that. You understand Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nBecause Monnin had signed a hefty contract with the Miss Universe Organization, the case was argued at arbitration. And because Monnin\u2019s lawyer was particularly terrible, according to a malpractice suit filed by Monnin and supported by a federal judge who later called his representation \u201cunconscionable,\u201d no one was there to defend her against Trump\u2019s main allegation: that her Facebook rants had caused the pageant to lose a $5 million sponsorship deal with BP and that young women who Googled Miss USA would see Miss Monnin\u2019s claims and not enter the competition, thinking that they didn\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nIn her request to have the $5 million award vacated, Monnin asked the court \u201cPlease do not enter a judgment that will financially devastate me for the rest of my life based on this record.\u201d Monnin later filed a malpractice claim against her attorney; a settlement from it helped her negotiate an end to her legal ordeal with Trump for a reported $1 million.\n\nAs Monnin\u2019s representative before she had legal counsel, her father spoke with Cohen twice over the phone in 2013. \u201cDuring our conversation there were threats and innuendo about what he would do to ruin her financially. For the rest of her life, he said she wouldn\u2019t be able to buy a car or have a credit card,\u201d Philip Monnin said.\n\nCohen appealed to her father to have Sheena Monnin delete all references to Trump or the pageant from her Facebook. The arbitration judge had refused to compel Monnin to remove the posts as part of the judgment against her.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to shut her down,\u201d Philip Monnin said.\n\nBut even in the face of a $5 million judgment, Monnin would not relent.\n\n\u201cAt first, he was not yelling,\u201d Philip Monnin said. But when he later called Cohen to relay her message, he said Cohen \u201cgot very angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe threw a fit on the phone,\u201d Philip Monnin said. \u201cHe basically said if I went along with my daughter I was an idiot. And said that she should apologize and if she didn\u2019t want to, then \u2018Game on,\u2019 and he slammed the phone down. And that was the end of the conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure if you check other people who have had to deal with him, you\u2019d hear the same. Just bullying tactics and intimidation.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Cohen himself explained the meaning behind his nickname, Trump\u2019s \u201cpit bull,\u201d in a 2011 interview with ABC News.\n\n\u201cIt means that if somebody does something Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t like, I do everything in my power to resolve it to Mr. Trump\u2019s benefit,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIf you do something wrong, I\u2019m going to come at you, grab you by the neck and I\u2019m not going to let you go until I\u2019m finished.\u201d\n\nThat attitude was on display when Cohen spoke with The Daily Beast. \u201cI will make sure that you and I meet one day while we\u2019re in the courthouse. And I will take you for every penny you still don\u2019t have. And I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else that you possibly know,\u201d Cohen told The Daily Beast reporter who reached out to the campaign for comment over ex-wife Ivana Trump\u2019s 1993 deposed assertion that she had been \u201craped\u201d by her then-husband, allegations she later softened in a statement in which she asked her comments not to be interpreted \u201cin a literal or criminal sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I\u2019m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting. You understand me?\u201d Cohen said.\n\nAnd that \u201cgrab you by the neck\u201d ethos was also demonstrated when Cohen tangled with the Monnin family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unsettling,\u201d Philip Monnin said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re up against someone with a lot of funds to carry out their threats. And most people don\u2019t even have the funds to defend themselves against nonsense.\u201d\n\nThough Cohen boasted that his legal prowess had poisoned the future of Monnin\u2014a model and entrepreneur with degrees in human service and psychology\u2014a federal court attributed Trump\u2019s win to her \u201cpoor choice of counsel\u201d and noted neither \u201csympathy, or apparent inequity,\u201d was enough to overturn the \u201cdevastating monetary award.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe gave Sheena some challenges, but he did not destroy her life,\u201d Philip Monnin said. \u201cHe can brag that he did, but she\u2019s not an idiot from Pennsylvania, she\u2019s a very intelligent young lady. When you take a stand for things that are right, it costs you.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:24.577+0000"}
{"entityId": 1513, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Jeb and Rubio are beating Hillary in the polls\u2014so why is the GOP so enthralled with guys like Trump and Carson?\n\nPresidential primaries are sometimes likened to dating; candidates try to woo voters, courting them, promising them the world, and then asking for their hand.\n\nIn the last two presidential elections, Republicans have dated around, seeing everyone from Rudy Giuliani to Herman Cain. But after a few summer flings, they\u2019ve always landed on the Very Nice And Responsible Choice.\n\nSo after having their hearts broken by John McCain and Mitt Romney, two candidates who promised \u201celectability\u201d and came up short, Republican primary voters may be ready to elope with the one their parents approve of least: Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nOr if not Trump, Ben Carson or Ted Cruz, two other candidates who are now sitting near the top of the GOP field but who political prognosticators expect would perform considerably less well against the Democratic nominee next November.\n\nYes, summer is often a silly time in a Republican primary, and the eventual nominees\u2014who seem inevitable in hindsight\u2014all had scares and moments buried in the pack.\n\nIn August 2007, Rudy Giuliani and Fred Thompson sat atop the GOP field; John McCain polled at a measly 7 percent. While Mitt Romney didn\u2019t have as terrible a summer in 2011, he was drowned out by Rick Perry for much of August and September and would later have to contend with a carousel of rising and falling opponents on his way to the nomination.\n\nBut the as far as summer flings go, the Summer of Trump takes the cake.\n\nRepublicans may have needed an \u201celectable\u201d candidate to beat the formidable political talent of Barack Obama, but to take on Hillary Clinton, maybe they think an out-there reality TV star and tabloid fixture could actually do the trick.\n\nThat\u2019s because, four years ago, electability really mattered to Republicans. Despite the rotating cast of characters on the upswing in the GOP race in 2011, Republican voters told Gallup that they preferred \u201csomeone who can beat Obama\u201d (50 percent) to \u201ca candidate who agrees\u201d with them on most issues (46 percent). Even more stunning, the Gallup data showed it was conservatives who were more focused on electability than were moderate and liberal Republicans (though presumably those moderates felt electability and their own views went hand in hand).\n\nToday, it isn\u2019t clear that electability matters all that much, or rather, that the definition of \u201celectability\u201d has changed.\n\nFirst, fewer voters today suggest that a candidate\u2019s ability to defeat the Democratic nominee is a major factor: Only 13 percent told the latest Fox News poll that they thought the ability to win in November 2016 was the most important factor in their choice. Strong leadership (29 percent) and conservative values (20 percent) topped the list. (Though, memo to Ted Cruz, \u201cWould shake things up in Washington\u201d also came in at only 13 percent.)\n\n\n\nNo doubt this is because, after having heard electability arguments in the last two presidential elections, Republicans have only seen \u201celectable\u201d candidates not get elected.\n\nFurthermore, though Hillary Clinton enjoys huge disdain from Republicans, perhaps Republicans are slightly less terrified by the specter of a Hillary Clinton presidency and don\u2019t view losing to her as being catastrophic\u2014a theory that seems crazy until you see that, in late 2014, polling showed Republicans liked her very slightly more than Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not the most bizarre explanation for the data. No, it is possible instead that the email scandals and her lackluster performance on the campaign trail have made her seem more vulnerable. Republicans may have needed an \u201celectable\u201d candidate to beat the formidable political talent of Barack Obama, but to take on Hillary Clinton, maybe they think an out-there reality TV star and tabloid fixture could actually do the trick.\n\nThe idea that Donald Trump actually is viewed as electable will strike most political pundits as insane. Yet \u201celectability\u201d may not only matter less\u2014it may have also been radically redefined after the respectable, responsible candidates failed to get the job done.\n\nThe most recent CNN poll asked Republicans to say which candidate best represented their values. Atop the pack? Ben Carson at 14 percent, followed by Donald Trump at 12 percent, Mike Huckabee at 11 percent and Ted Cruz at 10 percent.\n\n\n\nBut on the question of who \u201chas the best chance of winning in the general election?\u201d Trump actually increases to 22 percent, while Carson, Cruz, and Huckabee all fall out of the top tier, replaced by Jeb Bush (16 percent), Scott Walker (11 percent), and Marco Rubio (9 percent). Republican voters may be aware of Trump\u2019s apostasy on things like single-payer health care yet still think he\u2019s the guy with the big, terrific, huge plan to take out Hillary Clinton next year.\n\nSo what should make Republican leaders nervous isn\u2019t that voters are experimenting with a rebellious choice: It might be that they also genuinely think he\u2019s electable, too.\n\nPolls confirm that, at the moment, candidates like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush fare well against Hillary Clinton in matchups. But with the latest Fox News poll showing Trump down only five points to Clinton, these Trump-is-electable folks couldn\u2019t possibly be right, could they?\n\nAgainst a weakened Hillary Clinton, perhaps Republicans think just about anyone is electable\u2026 even Donald Trump.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:24.854+0000"}

{"entityId": 1515, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Is this the new McCarthyism? With the battle over gay marriage beyond hope, some conservatives say they fear being run out of public life for being on the losing side.\n\nThe war is over. Or at least it is nearing its end.\n\nIn November 2012, same-sex marriage was legalized at the ballot box in Maryland, Maine, and Washington, while Minnesota defeated a constitutional ban. Since then, bills legalizing same-sex marriage have been passed in Rhode Island and Delaware. Courts in deeply conservative states like Utah, Oklahoma, Texas, and Kentucky have ruled that marriage bans violate the Constitution. Nearly every Democratic officeholder in the land supports same-sex marriage, and each day seems to bring another Republican over.\n\nSavvy conservatives and evangelicals are acknowledging, often privately, that public opinion is not in their favor. And they fear what will happen in the future to those who fought against the rising tide of public opinion.\n\n\u201cWe have people who are losing their jobs, being smeared publicly because they hold the view that marriage is a union between one man and one woman,\u201d said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, an evangelical think tank and lobbying organization. \u201cThey are called bigots. Homophobes. That is not the way we operate in a free society.\u201d\n\nPerkins was speaking to The Daily Beast in the lobby of a New Orleans hotel in between sessions of the Republican Leadership Conference, a semi-annual gathering of conservatives from around the country. At an address to the delegates earlier in the day, Perkins railed against what he called \u201cThe New McCarthyism,\u201d which \u201cwould force every corporate leader, university official, public contractor, or media figure to answer a question: \u2018Are you now or have you ever been involved in an effort to preserve marriage as the union of a man and a woman?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll go further than that,\u201d Perkins continued. \u201cThis New McCarthyism demands, \u2018Do you now think or have you ever thought that marriage should remain the union of a man and a woman?\u2019 Answer incorrectly, and watch your career be taken from you and your reputation smeared on a thousand websites.\u201d\n\nMany of these fears burst out into the open earlier this year when Brendan Eich, the CEO of Mozilla, was run out of his position after it was revealed that he had donated money to the anti-gay marriage cause in California. Although some supporters of gay rights even thought the Eich affair was handled poorly, it sent a signal \u201cthat you have to be politically correct if you want to attain a higher position,\u201d said Warner Todd Huston, a conservative activist and writer.\n\n\u201cThat is the fear, that traditional American values are being criminalized as opposed to simply being out of fashion,\u201d he said.\n\nFor gay rights activists, such concerns appear overblown and can be used to stoke paranoia on the right.\n\n\u201cThis is a tactic. We have to call this out,\u201d said Alvin McEwan, author of How They See Us: Unmasking the Religious Right War on Gay America and a blogger at Holy Bullies and Headless Monsters, a site, he says, that is dedicated to showing \u201chow religious-right groups distort legitimate research and rely on junk studies to stigmatize the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities.\u201d The Eich case, McEwan said, was not proof of a witch hunt but proof that the American free enterprise system that conservatives extol was working properly.\n\n\u201cPeople have a right to boycott a business if they don\u2019t like you,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd even though McEwan said he does not think that gay-marriage opponents should be cast out of public life, conservatives, he added, have been warning the citizenry about \u201cthe gay agenda\u201d for years.\n\n\u201cThey have this entitlement thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a right to believe what they want to believe, but they have to share the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis notion that our position is one that doesn\u2019t belong in the public square is something we should all be worried about.\u201d\n\nSame-sex marriage is, of course, not the first issue to divide Americans. Slavery, segregation, and abortion led to civil war, vigilante violence, and massive protest movements.\n\nBut opponents of same-sex marriage say that even in those instances there was d\u00e9tente after passions cooled. One-time segregationists remained in the upper echelons of American public life through the 1990s. This time, opponents of same-sex marriage fear that supporters will not be happy until their side has been run out of polite society and forced to retract their previously held views.\n\n\u201cEven supporters of abortion don\u2019t go around saying that people who believe that life begins at conception are evil people,\u201d said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization of Marriage. \u201cBut this is not the case here, and the problem is that the establishment gay marriage groups have not condemned this view that those of us who favor traditional marriage are bigots and therefore should be abolished.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s group has fought to keep the names of its donors secret for just that reason. He has been threatened and targeted, he said, and pointed to an incident last year in which a gunman attempted to shoot up the headquarters of the Family Research Council while holding a bag of food from Chik-fil-A, the conservative Christian company that was a target of boycotts over its owner\u2019s anti-gay views. Brown noted that according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the FRC is a \u201chate group, in the same category as the KKK.\u201d\n\nAnother difference between earlier American civil rights conflicts and this one, he said, was that slavery, or discriminating against someone on the basis of race, was considered immoral around the world for centuries while the practice was ongoing in parts of the U.S. Hardly anyone in politics, on the other hand, was pushing for gay marriage \u201cuntil about 10 years ago, but the people who don\u2019t totally want to redefine a definition of marriage that has lasted for thousands of years need to be shunned.\u201d\n\nOpponents of same-sex marriage say that even liberals have started to feel the effects of the witch hunt. While to many listeners Hillary Clinton\u2019s interview with Terry Gross last week was an example of a politician fumbling through a response to a question about her evolution on gay marriage, to conservatives it was proof that everyone who once held a different view must now apologize and be publicly flogged for it.\n\nRyan T. Anderson, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has argued against legalizing same-sex marriage, said he does not think opponents will be treated the same way those who opposed, say, interracial marriage are now. And he cited an example that proponents of gay rights often use to describe the evolution of greater acceptance of their ideas.\n\nEven proponents of same-sex marriage, Anderson said, \u201cmay have family members who are against gay marriage. It is hard to believe that my mom or my great-uncle or someone is a bigot.\u201d\n\nYet Anderson himself was involved in an incident that anti-gay marriage activists point to as an example of the increasing threat they are under. After he was booked to speak at Stanford earlier this year, an uproar ensued and gay student groups demanded that the organization that invited Anderson be stripped of its funding to put on the event.\n\nAnderson said he had spoken at the university without incident the previous year, and he attributed the change in tone to Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s ruling in the Supreme Court\u2019s gay marriage case, in which he wrote that the purpose of bans was to \u201cdisparage and injure\u201d gay couples.\n\n\u201cHe was essentially saying that opposing viewpoints don\u2019t have a right to be heard,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nIn the meantime, as this particular culture war fades out, it is unclear when the soldiers will be free to leave their trenches, and conservatives know who to blame.\n\n\u201cThe pro-gay marriage people need to accept that even though we disagree, we are not hateful,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThis notion that our position is one that doesn\u2019t belong in the public square is something we should all be worried about.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:26.100+0000"}

And Rand Paul notwithstanding, most GOP insiders believe them, too.\n\nPeople seem mystified by Dick Cheney. What on earth is he doing, popping up with such regularity defending a wholly discredited position, as he did again Monday at a Politico forum? Why would he continue to say things like invading Iraq was \u201cabsolutely the right thing to do\u201d? The track record of utterances he compiled as vice president\u2014all of them collected on video for our present-day delectation, like his famous \u201cweeks rather than months\u201d prediction to CBS\u2019 Bob Schieffer right before we started the Iraq war\u2014would have a person of decency and modesty hiding in self-imposed exile in the Pampean Andes.\n\nI contend that there\u2019s nothing mysterious about him at all. Incredible as it may seem, he does still think he was right. The tactical mistakes, if there were any, were mere details. But the invasion of Iraq was the right thing to do, he still undoubtedly believes. And it\u2019s important that we understand the real reason he thinks it was the right thing to do, because Iraq failure or no Iraq failure, Rand Paul or no Rand Paul, Cheney\u2019s view will always be dominant in the Republican Party\u2019s higher echelons.\n\nThere were always a lot of misperceptions about the Iraq war, in the mainstream media and among liberal opponents of it. Oversimplifying a bit, the media bought that it was about 9/11; that we had to strike back. It was also, in this narrative, about Saddam Hussein\u2019s alleged weapons of mass destruction and his even more alleged nuclear capabilities. These were the reasons the Bush administration put forward to scare the public, and the media, to their everlasting dishonor, bought those arguments.\n\n\n\nAl Qaeda has receded; terrorism too. But the idea that the United States must maintain its hegemonic status in a unipolar world\u2014on the right, that has staying power.\n\nOn the broad left, people tended toward the fundamental explanations of political economy: that it was about oil, or Halliburton, or, in Michael Moore\u2019s interpretation, the Carlyle Group. Oil was a factor, a side benefit. But it wasn\u2019t about oil, and it certainly wasn\u2019t about Halliburton or Carlyle.\n\nIt was about establishing global American hegemony. To get this fully you have to go back to 1992, when Cheney was the secretary of defense. Cheney\u2019s world view was wholly formed by the Cold War. The bipolar world of U.S. v. USSR, good v. evil, was all he\u2019d known. It was the rubric under which all thought was organized. Then, suddenly, the USSR was gone! Now what?\n\nCheney\u2019s Pentagon\u2014including figures such as Paul Wolfowitz and even Colin Powell, who may be a good guy now but was fully implicated in all this at the time\u2014set to pondering that question, and by the spring of 1992, it came up with an answer: the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG), a white paper outlining future U.S. defense policy. Now that we were the only superpower in the world, it said, our main job was to make damn sure things stayed that way.\n\nRemember: This was precisely the moment, the end of the Cold War, when most Americans were thinking that maybe we could relax a little, step back from the war footing that had characterized the previous 45 years. But the DPG said the opposite. The new posture would require a certain new tough-mindedness. We might have to thumb our noses at traditional allies. We certainly would have to expand our global reach (and keep spending new billions). And most crucially, the DPG introduced, for the first time ever in American history, the idea that preemptive war should be an official part of our policy. (Yes, it\u2019s been unofficial policy plenty of times, but this was different.)\n\n\n\nThe DPG was enormously controversial at the time. Amid some media tumult, the first President Bush had to come out and say in essence, hey, kidding. But Cheney & Co. certainly weren\u2019t. (For a lot more on this history, read the great Harper\u2019s magazine piece by David Armstrong from 2002, \u201cDick Cheney\u2019s Song of America,\u201d still one of the finest pieces of Iraq war journalism we have.)\n\nThe Republicans lost the White House in 1992, of course, and were out of power for eight years. So they didn\u2019t have a chance to act on their scheme. But then they got back in. And then came 9/11. Lo and behold! What a gift! Of course I\u2019m not saying they were happy it happened, but imagine: If ever there were an event that could frighten the American people into embracing an aggressive foreign-policy posture that set out to establish the United States as the single global hegemon, 9/11 surely was it. It still didn\u2019t frighten the people enough, quite, which is why the Bushies had to lie about WMD and nukes and \u201cweeks rather than months,\u201d but the hegemonists knew that this was their only shot to act on those 1992 schemes, and bam, they took it.\n\nThat\u2019s why we went to war in Iraq. (We chose Iraq because of the \u201cunfinished work\u201d of the Gulf War, because it looked ripe for the taking, and because it was a medium-size dog whose quick whipping would scare the larger ones.) It wasn\u2019t about terrorism or anything like that. It was about, as James Bond once sighed to Dr. No, \u201cworld domination, the same old story.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that history today because the dream of establishing global American hegemony is much more enduring and powerful on the right than all the stated reasons. Al Qaeda has receded; terrorism too; WMD was just a handy thing lying around. But the idea that the United States must maintain its hegemonic status in a unipolar world\u2014on the right, that has staying power. And modern conservatism is organized in such a way that thousands of people are paid millions of dollars to make sure the staying power stays.\n\nThe Tea Party base, as we know, is less than enamored of these ideas. Sen. Paul articulates their views. So the feud between Paul and Cheney\u2014and John McCain and others\u2014is really a feud between the base and the elites. Paul is a savvy politician, and I certainly don\u2019t count him out as the possible 2016 nominee, but we all know that in both parties, especially the GOP, the elites usually win such feuds. So Cheney will keep at it as long as he draws breath. And someday, something awful will happen, and the Cheney wing will step up to the plate and swing for the fences again.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:26.366+0000"}

In wrestling, the grapplers talk trash before the match starts. In politics, they mostly do their trash talking after the match is over.\n\nIt\u2019s now been more than a week since Donald Trump encountered\u2014at what should have been a routine news conference at the Grand River Center in Dubuque, Iowa\u2014something the billionaire real estate developer is not used to seeing: an ego as big as his own.\n\nThe healthy self-image belongs to Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, perhaps the nation\u2019s most popular Spanish-language media figure and sometime activist.\n\nI\u2019m being careful not to use the \u201cj-word.\u201d While Ramos considers himself a journalist\u2014apparently a weird hybrid blend of anchor, reporter, analyst and commentator\u2014I\u2019m not sure, given how he conducted himself at the Iowa news conference, that the newsman can still lay claim to the title.\n\nFor one thing, Ramos trampled at least a dozen rules and customs dictating how journalists are supposed to behave. Ramos was unprofessional in his demeanor and impolite to his colleagues. He made himself the story, posed arguments rather than questions, and freely expressed his own opinions.\n\nHe also played the victim when challenged, and failed to disclose at that moment a potential conflict of interest\u2014that his daughter works for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nThe mainstream media\u2014including NBC News\u2019s Kasie Hunt, who was in the ballroom when the Ramos/Trump collision took place\u2014absolved Ramos of his sins, rationalizing his unprofessionalism as proof of how much he cares about the immigration issue.\n\nRamos has long been compromised by the fact that his employer, Univision, has such strong ties to the Obama administration and Democrats.\n\nTrump was surprisingly less forgiving. He doesn\u2019t think that Ramos is much of a journalist, as he made clear the next morning on NBC\u2019s Today Show. The newsman, Trump said, was \u201ctotally out of line\u201d when he \u201cstood up and started ranting and raving like a madman.\u201d\n\nRamos quickly returned fire. During an appearance a few days later on ABC News\u2019s This Week, Ramos called Trump \u201cdangerous\u201d and accused the GOP frontrunner of \u201cpromoting in his speeches bigotry and hatred against immigrants and Latinos.\u201d\n\nBoth men insist that they have received nothing but positive feedback from their respective fan bases.\n\nTeam Trump thinks Ramos was acting more like an advocate than a journalist; Team Ramos thinks Trump tried to stifle criticism. If the goal was to get attention, both men came out winners. So we can expect more mutually beneficial run-ins between these two, as Trump himself seemed to imply at the end of the exchange when he told Ramos: \u201cYou and me will talk. We\u2019re going to be talking a lot over the years.\u201d\n\nThe Univision anchor/activist acknowledges that he flew to Iowa to confront Trump about the candidate\u2019s immigration plan. But when Ramos jumped to his feet and started speaking, drowning out another reporter, the businessman admonished him: \u201cSit down, you weren\u2019t called. Go back to Univision.\u201d Trump then signaled one of the security guards (who also happens to be his bodyguard) to remove Ramos from the room.\n\nAnd, over the newsman\u2019s vocal objections, that\u2019s just what happened. While Ramos waited in the hallway, a Trump supporter began arguing with him and eventually told Ramos, a U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico: \u201cGo back to your country.\u201d\n\nThen, after Hunt and another reporter questioned how Trump handled the situation, the real estate developer allowed Ramos to return and ask questions. The two men bantered back and forth for the next several minutes. Before long, the conversation had run its course. That\u2019s when Trump made his comment about how the two men would be \u201ctalking a lot over the years.\u201d\n\nIronically, with his emotional hijinks, Ramos might actually have hurt his own cause. He wound up playing into every negative stereotype that Americans subscribe to about Mexicans who come uninvited across the U.S.-Mexico border. If you think Mexican immigrants are pushy rule breakers who don\u2019t wait their turn, Ramos\u2019s filibuster in Iowa only feeds that perception.\n\nNow that the altercation is over with, and each participant has had the chance to spin the events, we\u2019ve entered the final act of this telenovela.\n\nThat\u2019s where Ramos\u2014rather than submit to peer review\u2014portrays himself as the only real journalist left in North America who isn\u2019t afraid to speak truth to power. It\u2019s where, instead of apologizing for breaking the rules, he insists that all journalists should break the rules more often. It\u2019s where Ramos, in effect, demands amnesty for himself by arguing that he committed no sin.\n\nIt\u2019s also in this final act that pundits and analysts are free to speculate whether Trump\u2019s shoddy treatment of Ramos will cost the GOP frontrunner any shot he might have had to revive his support from Hispanics. A recent Gallup Poll shows Trump with a net favorability rating of minus 51 percent among Hispanics. Could Trump\u2019s dustup with Ramos make him even more unpopular with that group of voters?\n\nWait and see. Personally, I don\u2019t except many Hispanics to walk around wearing buttons that proclaim: \u201cI am Jorge.\u201d And take it from a Hispanic journalist who has been on the job for a quarter-century: I\u2019m not Jorge.\n\nHow do I know? After his confrontation with Trump, as he was trying to lecture the rest of us on how to do our jobs\u2014despite having just failed at his\u2014Ramos said this: \u201cI think it is very important that, as journalists, we challenge those who are in power.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s rich. Ramos has never challenged President Obama, Hillary Clinton and other Democrats with the same ferocity he shows when attacking Trump and Republicans. He criticizes Trump because, he says, his deportation policies could divide families.\n\nWhere\u2019s his constant criticism of Obama, whose deportation policies DID divide families?\n\nYes, as has often been noted by those who want to construct a narrative that he\u2019s nonpartisan, during the 2012 election, Ramos did gently poke at Obama about a broken promise to push for immigration reform in his first term. But there was no shouting, no charges of promoting hatred.\n\nRamos has long been compromised by the fact that his employer, Univision, has such strong ties to the Obama administration and Democrats.\n\nIn 2012, just a few months before the election, the president nominated Cheryl Saban to serve as the U.S. representative to the UN General Assembly\u2014a largely symbolic position. Cheryl is the wife of Israeli-American billionaire Haim Saban, a mega-donor to the Democratic Party who supported Clinton in 2008. He is also the owner of Univision.\n\nIn 2016, Saban is publicly backing Clinton\u2019s bid for the presidency. Univision has partnered with the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. And, of course, as mentioned, Ramos\u2019s daughter works for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nThose entanglements could be why one doesn\u2019t hear much talk on Ramos\u2019s Sunday political show, Al Punto, about the ever-worsening scandal involving Clinton\u2019s private email server. In the world according to Ramos, Democrats sometimes make bad decisions. But Republicans are almost always bad people.\n\nThose on the left call that common sense. Those on the right call it slander.

Lawmakers predicted a coming public and congressional backlash.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown immediately suggested that Americans turn to \u201cWendy\u2019s Old Fashioned Hamburgers or White Castle sliders\u201d in the wake of reports that Burger King had \u201cabandoned their country.\u201d\n\nBoth Wendy\u2019s and White Castle are based in Ohio, the state that Brown represents in the Senate. On the other hand, Brazilian private equity firm 3G is the majority owner of Burger King, which is based in Florida.\n\n\u201cTo help business grow in America, taxpayers have funded public infrastructure, workforce training, and incentives to encourage R&D and capital investment,\u201d Brown thundered. \u201cRunaway corporations benefited from those policies but want U.S. companies to pay their share of the tab.\u201d\n\nSen. Carl Levin, who has long been a champion for closing corporate tax loopholes, warned the company that the blowback from the American consumer could swamp any tax benefits it receives from leaving the United States. He was speaking before the deal was confirmed on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\u201cMadam Speaker, this is America; it is not Burger King. The President cannot always have it his way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere could well be a strong public reaction against Burger King that could more than offset any tax benefit it receives from a tax avoidance move,\u201d he said Monday, describing the deal as \u201canother example of why Congress can\u2019t afford to wait any longer to put a stop to tax dodging through this kind of merger.\u201d\n\nFor Sen. Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, the Burger King news emphasized the need for a tax overhaul that would make it more attractive for American companies to stay in the United States.\n\n\u201cBurger King\u2019s pursuit of an inversion only further underscores the arcane, anti-competitive nature of the U.S. tax code. Short of a tax overhaul that will make it easier for American companies to invest and create more jobs at home, Senator Hatch has advocated for an interim proposal to address the disturbing recent uptick in inversions,\u201d Julia Lawless, a Hatch spokeswoman, told The Daily Beast. \u201cHe\u2019s continuing to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle and hopes to find a viable policy-driven, apolitical proposal.\u201d\n\nWhile Canada does offer a more attractive tax rate\u201415 percent at the federal level, compared to America\u2019s 35 percent\u2014the tax burden is far from the only factor in Burger King\u2019s potential move to Canada.\n\nTim Hortons is a coffee chain nearly synonymous with Canadian identity, and Canadian law provides for the nixing of mergers that isn\u2019t in the national interest, a problem which could come up if the company was to move its operations to the United States rather than the other way around. Given many large American corporations are able to avoid much of their taxes through loopholes, taxes may be just one of the considerations in any potential deal.\n\nBurger King\u2019s possible move has the potential to become a potential political symbol of a broader economic malaise, as have other such moves in the past\u2014real or perceived.\n\nGOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney claimed that President Obama\u2019s automotive sector policies had driven Jeep to consider a move to China (this claim was later singled out as PolitiFact\u2019s \u201cLie of the Year\u201d ). And when John Kerry was running for president, he repeatedly condemned corporate \u201cBenedict Arnolds\u201d who move jobs and operations overseas to reduce tax obligations.\n\nBurger King itself has been a part of the congressional conversion, both as a punchline and as part of the debate on the minimum wage in America. For example, Rep. Ted Poe made a speech on the House floor in January to denounce what he viewed as President Obama\u2019s \u201cimperial\u201d executive orders.\n\n\u201cMadam Speaker, this is America; it is not Burger King,\u201d Poe said. \u201cThe President cannot always have it his way.\u201d\n\nBurger King has also become a sort of synonym for \u2018minimum wage job,\u2019 with numerous mentions in speeches and interviews as shorthand for the topic. Sen. Tom Harkin invoked the case of a 50-year-old Burger King worker in December to make a point about the minimum wage and unemployment benefits.\n\nAnd Florida GOP Sen.

{"entityId": 1520, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Don\u2019t blame turnout. How a late change in strategy may have sent Democratic volunteers after the exact wrong type of voter.\n\nThe much-vaunted Democratic turnout machine didn\u2019t fail Tuesday. Volunteer shifts made record numbers of calls and door knocks across the country to turn out Democratic voters. In fact, according to NGP-VAN, the company that handles data for the Democratic allies, voter contacts were up 54 percent over 2010 and, in some states, even rivaled 2012 numbers.\n\nThe problem is that they might have been calling some of the wrong voters and knocking some of the wrong doors.\n\nThe Daily Beast has learned that in the crucial swing states of Iowa, North Carolina, and Colorado, the DSCC made a decision in September to put an increased emphasis on persuasion, talking undecided voters into supporting Democratic candidates rather than turning out its base voters. In other words, instead of going after the type of people who reliably vote Democrat but don\u2019t reliably show up on Election Day, they focused on voters who were somewhat more likely to vote but hadn\u2019t firmly made up their minds\n\nThese undecided, persuadable voters were identified via a computer model that ranked and ordered voters as targets of persuasion not just through volunteer contact but through direct-mail paid media as well. The problem was that, at least in Iowa, this model was imperfect.\n\nAccording to information obtained by The Daily Beast, the universe of persuasion targets in the Hawkeye State according to this model included 33 percent Republicans and 50 percent independents. These voters were contacted by volunteers and received at least 10 different pieces of direct mail in addition to whatever television and radio advertisements they saw or listened to. Initial data indicate that more than 60 percent of voters in this group who actually turned out on Election Day supported Republican candidates.\n\nThis was compounded by making overly optimistic assumptions about independent voters who had signed up for absentee ballots in Iowa. Internal Democratic estimates projected that Bruce Braley, the losing Senate candidate in Iowa, would have a lead of roughly 28,000 votes going into Election Day based on absentee ballots. Instead, he only won early voters by 18,000 votes. This difference: Braley was projected internally to be getting support from 65 percent of independents who voted early; he ended up much closer to 50 percent.\n\nNone of these decisions individually determined the course of the election. As a Democratic strategist took pains to point out to The Daily Beast, \u201cturnout was always a priority in Iowa, North Carolina, and Colorado\u201d and Democrats were able to build \u201cmulti-layer programs\u201d that accomplished a variety of goals, including turning out base Democrats and trying to woo undecided voters. Further, creating models for persuasion is \u201cincredibly hard.\u201d Unlike calculating the likelihood that a voter will show up at the polls or how strongly partisan they are, it takes a much more sophisticated effort that changes with events. After all, diehard partisans rarely change their stripes\u2014but floating voters who can be persuaded are more difficult to identify and far more prone to changing their minds.\n\nInstead, problems with this strategy may have just compounded the difficulties for Democrats in what turned out to be a wave election year for the GOP. One Democratic strategist looking back at the numbers in Iowa said there appeared to be about 20,000 to 30,000 Democratic voters in the Hawkeye State who didn\u2019t show up on Election Day. This drop in turnout could be attributed to a number of other factors, including the poor atmosphere and Braley\u2019s poor Des Moines Register poll numbers on the eve of the election, when it turned out the candidate who seemed to be tied was actually down by seven percentage points.\n\nRegardless of how it occurred, this gap was not decisive in a state where Braley lost by nearly 100,000 voters. The four-term Democratic congressman has long been labeled a flawed candidate by outside observers, particularly for his infamous comments attacking Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley as a farmer who did not go to law school.\n\nBut a strategy that refocused Democratic volunteers on persuading their neighbors to back the ticket rather than pushing marginal voters to cast their ballots early certainly had an effect, particularly with the imperfect universe used to determine those voters who could be persuaded. In a presidential election, this matters less. After all, almost everyone with the inclination to vote will show up at a polling place. But turnout tends to be far more variable in a midterm election and modeling become far difficult. But there\u2019s time for Democrats to go back to the drawing board\u2014and certainly their ability to model has been far more successful in recent presidential elections than in off years.\n\nIn the meantime, one Democratic operative shrugged off Tuesday\u2019s results: \u201cSometimes people just fucking hate you.\u201d The problem is that you don\u2019t do any favors for your campaign if you\u2019re accidentally pushing some of those people to turn out.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:27.965+0000"}

Really.\n\nKim Kardashian has endorsed Hillary Clinton. Being a Kardashian, she has done so with a selfie.\n\nWhen asked recently if she thinks Clinton should be America\u2019s first female president, she enthusiastically replied, \u201cI hope so!\u201d And on the night of the first 2016 Republican presidential debate, Kardashian (featuring Kanye) had the opportunity to fan-girl all over Hillary\u2014\u201cour next President,\u201d as Kim would say.\n\n(Clinton reportedly broke protocol in order to achieve that power-selfie.)\n\nIt does make sense that the reality-TV star/socialite would be Ready for Hillary. Kardashian is liberal, having evolved from her previous stance as a self-identified \u201cliberal Republican\u201d a few years back. She sided with the Democrats in the last midterm elections, and supports President Obama.\n\nHowever, there is one important caveat to Kardashian\u2019s endorsement. During her time as Secretary of State, Clinton had used her power and influence to work against the very political cause about which Kardashian is most passionate: recognition of the Armenian genocide, during which the Ottoman government killed more than 1 million souls during and after World War I.\n\nEarlier this year, Kardashian\u2014herself of Armenian descent\u2014traveled to Armenia just before the 100th anniversary of the mass slaughter to get in touch with her roots and to visit the genocide memorial in Yerevan. Prime Minister Hovik Abrahamyan personally received her and her family, and praised her for aiding in the \u201cinternational recognition and condemnation of the Armenian genocide.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt happened before Rwanda, Darfur, and the Holocaust,\u201d Kardashian blogged in a post slamming the Turkish government for genocide denial in 2011. \u201cMaybe none of those other genocides would have happened if more nations had condemned the Armenian Genocide, when 1.5 million Armenians were massacred.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s track record as a senator on this subject would be agreeable to someone with Kardashian\u2019s views. During her 2008 campaign, she issued a statement boasting that \u201calone among the [2008] presidential candidates, I have been a long-standing supporter of the Armenian Genocide Resolution.\u201d\n\nBut after she landed the job of Secretary of State in the Obama administration, international politics and diplomacy started getting in the way. Secretary Clinton, unlike Sen. Clinton, stopped tossing out the term \u201cgenocide\u201d when discussing the matter in public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shift that illustrates the difficulty Clinton faced balancing the interests of the Turks and collective memory,\u201d Taylor Wofford reported in Newsweek in April. \u201cClinton needed to woo Turkey, a U.S. ally and fellow NATO member, on issues ranging from the Iraq War to interdicting drug trafficking to pushing back against Vladimir Putin. And, historically, nothing has riled the Turks quite like calling what happened between 1915 and 1917 a genocide.\u201d\n\nWhen the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide in 2010, Secretary Clinton voiced her opposition.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration strongly opposes the resolution that was passed by only one vote in the House committee and will work very hard to make sure it does not go to the House floor,\u201d she said. (It did not make it to the House floor.)\n\nStill, Clinton\u2019s position during her time at the State Department may not have dampened Kardashian\u2019s support all that much. After all, she has been a dedicated Obama supporter, even as she called him out over the issue. \u201cI would like President Obama to use the word genocide,\u201d she wrote in a Time op-ed published last April. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing he hasn\u2019t used it as President. We thought it was going to happen this year. I feel like we\u2019re close\u2014but we\u2019re definitely moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nPerhaps she\u2019ll have more luck if Hillary is elected. Certainly, 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s position appears to be back in line with her position in the Senate and on the \u201908 campaign trail. \u201cHillary Clinton has a record of expressing her own view that this was a genocide,\u201d a Clinton aide told Newsweek. \u201cShe also has a record of promoting reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia and as secretary of state she personally worked to advance that goal.\u201d\n\nKardashian\u2019s representative did not respond to a request for comment.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:28.202+0000"}

It\u2019s sandwiched between Fort Lauderdale and Miami, a cramped seaside waiting room populated by condominiums, motels, personal injury attorneys, and pawnshops. But funnily enough, Hollywood is where I happened to be when I read \u201cIDEA 90\u201d on Wednesday.\n\nIt does seem unlikely that if Rubio were to have succeeded in building his own Hollywood in Florida, he could have avoided doing it anywhere except Hollywood, Florida. Where else was he going to build it, Tallahassee? Then you\u2019d have Hollywood, Florida, and Tallahassee, Florida (now with more Hollywood!). It would get confusing. He would have had to spend a lot of taxpayer funds reissuing maps. I asked Rubio\u2019s campaign about this issue and received no response.\n\nAnyhow, the \u201cIDEA 90\u201d chapter begins, like all chapters should, with a quotation from George W. Bush: \u201cIn this world of change, some things do not change: the values we try to live by, the institutions that give our lives meaning and purpose. Our society rests on a foundation of responsibility and character and family commitment.\u201d\n\nThe film industry, Rubio explains, is a large part of Florida\u2019s economy, with $372 million in wages to Florida workers in 2001 coming from motion picture production. But, Rubio laments, \u201cin the past two years, not one commercial or music video has qualified for Florida\u2019s film incentive.\u201d\n\nTo remedy the problem, Rubio suggests that \u201cFlorida should create a tax incentive program aimed at attracting more film productions and TV series to the state, with a priority given to those productions that are given \u2018family-friendly\u2019 ratings such as G or PG.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Rubio\u2019s campaign for a more comprehensive definition of the senator\u2019s view of \u201cfamily friendly,\u201d his spokesman, Alex Conant, responded, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know what you're referring to.\u201d\n\nIn April, TMZ asked Rubio what kind of music he likes. The senator called himself \u201ca Nicki Minaj fan.\u201d That\u2019d be the Nicki Minaj who famously rapped \u201cReal country a-- n---a, let me play with his rifle; P---y put his a-- to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil.\u201d\n\nSo perhaps the senator\u2019s definition of family friendly is somewhat broader than the reaction to his tax incentive proposal in Florida may have suggested.\n\nThe \u201cfamily friendly\u201d tax credits started being issued a year after Rubio\u2019s book came out, in 2007. In 2010, a $75 million tax incentive proposal made its way to the floor of the legislature, and the measure included within it a provision prohibiting tax credits for productions with \u201cnontraditional family values.\u201d\n\nWould a President Rubio seek to reward people producing \u201cfamily friendly\u201d entertainment with tax breaks and let those who produce whatever the opposite of \u201cfamily friendly\u201d entertainment is fend for themselves?\n\nAccording to The Palm Beach Post, \u201cmovies and TV shows with gay characters\u201d could be refused the tax credit, as there was no comprehensive definition for what \u201cnontraditional family values\u201d meant in the text of the bill.\n\nThe executive director for Florida Together, a coalition of equal-rights groups in the state, told the publication, \u201cInstituting 1950s-style movie censorship does nothing to support real-life families or help Florida\u2019s struggling economy.\u201d\n\nI asked Rubio\u2019s campaign if as president he would similarly seek to reward people producing \u201cfamily friendly\u201d entertainment with tax breaks and let those who produce whatever the opposite of \u201cfamily friendly\u201d entertainment is fend for themselves.

And Danny Carroll, the man that they\u2019re likely to choose to supervise the 2016 Republican caucuses is an ardent social conservative who gave up pumpkin farming to devote himself full-time to the fight to save heterosexual marriage in the Hawkeye State.\n\nCarroll, who just recently became co-chair of a state Republican Party long divided between social conservatives, libertarians, and the traditional pro-business GOP establishment, is the only candidate running to succeed A.J. Spiker, the outgoing chair who announced his resignation earlier this month. Spiker is leaving the Republican Party of Iowa to take a position with RANDPAC, the political action committee of Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY). But while Spiker\u2019s tenure as state chair raised eyebrows because of his close relationship to the libertarian wing of the party, Carroll\u2019s links with the most social conservative elements of the GOP have led him to buck the party less than four years ago.\n\nIn the 2010 election, Carroll refused to back Terry Branstad, Iowa\u2019s current Republican governor, when the state\u2019s former four-term chief executive was mounting a political comeback against an incumbent Democrat. Although Branstad supported a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, Carroll thought that Iowa Republican icon wasn\u2019t doing enough for the cause. In contrast, while Spiker\u2019s tenure was controversial because of his clashes with Branstad, at least he always supported the five-term Republican governor and the rest of the GOP ticket on Election Day.\n\nThe irony is that Carroll himself, a former Speaker Pro Tempore of the Iowa House was once talked about as a Republican gubernatorial nominee. Prior to being defeated in 2006 for re-election, Carroll had been marked as a rising star in Iowa politics but ardent social conservative views made his race a nexus for national progressive donors and also didn\u2019t play well in a district where students from Grinnell College, a top ranked liberal-arts college, turned out at a higher rate.\n\nAfter leaving office, Carroll became Chairman of the Board of the Iowa Family Policy Center, part of The FAMiLY LEADER, a social conservative political organization that \u201cprovides consistent, courageous voice in the charges, in the legislature, in the media, in the courtroom, in the public square\u2026always standing for God\u2019s truth.\u201d In particular, the organization has been very active on gay marriage, which has been legal in Iowa since 2009 after a unanimous decision of the Iowa Supreme Court. The group and Carroll were active in the effort to successfully recall three of the court\u2019s judges in 2010 in retaliation for their pro same-sex marriage decision.\n\nIn 2011, Carroll supported Judge Roy Moore during his brief the Republican presidential nomination. Moore is famous for placing a monument of the Ten Commandments in his courtroom. That maneuver garnered him fans among many social conservatives. When he announced his bid for the GOP nomination, Moore said that the \u201cproblems arising out of same-sex marriages\u201d include \u201cchild abuse, adoption, divorce, foster care, alimony, and the list goes on and on\u2026\u201d Carroll himself said that he was \u201chonored to be a part\u201d of Moore\u2019s campaign.\n\nWere Carroll to be elected Chairman of Iowa\u2019s Republican Party as expected to fill the remainder of Spiker\u2019s term, he is likely to continue through 2016, which would make him a national figure during the run up to the caucuses. Carroll would not only be responsible for overseeing the success of a caucus process plagued with issues in 2012 but he would become a national face for a GOP in the middle of a much vaunted rebranding.\n\nEric Palmer, a former Democratic state representative who ran against Carroll three times for the state legislature and defeated him in 2006 and 2008, told The Daily Beast that a Carroll-led Iowa GOP would be bad news for our increasingly polarized country. \u201cHis views are so far right, especially on religion, that I can\u2019t imagine [electing him] is a healing type of move [for the country].

Not yet.\n\nBy announcing so close to the debate, Kasich could get a bump of a percentage or two that would put him just inside the top tier. His announcement was followed by an appearance on Sean Hannity\u2019s show, a three-day swing through New Hampshire, then on to stops in Iowa and South Carolina. In short, he\u2019s going to be everywhere.\n\nOne Ohio Republican strategist with knowledge of the governor\u2019s strategy said the old-fashioned barn-storming, coupled with TV appearances and ads from Kasich\u2019s Super PAC, could give him the needed boost to get into the main stage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely vital he\u2019s in the debate, it\u2019s his home state,\u201d the Republican said.\n\nMeanwhile, former Texas governor Rick Perry has talked his way back into the news cycle by aggressively going after Trump.

Before that, Perry had been extremely critical of Trump\u2019s comments on immigration.\n\nAnd their fight doesn\u2019t end there. As Trump launched withering criticism on Perry from the South Carolina stage\u2014he suggested numerous times that Perry was just too dumb to be president\u2014Perry\u2019s campaign retweeted old Donald Trump missives praising the then-Texas governor.\n\n\u201cRick Perry is right when he says we must stand by Israel in the UN,\u201d said one tweet from September 2011.\n\n\u201cRick Perry\u2014a good man, a great family and a patriot,\u201d said another from January 2012.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut did attacking Trump really raise Perry\u2019s profile?

And since 0.5 percent is all that currently separates those who are in and those who will be banished to the B-list debate, why not give hitting it a try?\n\nBut actually it might not be that easy, said Jeff Horwitt, a vice president at Hart Research Associates, a D.C.-based polling firm.\n\nHorwitt said Perry\u2019s bump could be in the margin of error\u2014since moving polling numbers significantly is harder than it looks.\n\n\u201cThe criteria for the Fox News debate does put the lower-tier candidates in a somewhat unique position at this early stage of trying to attach themselves to the news of the day and make themselves relevant so they can hold on and be one of the 10 candidates standing on the stage,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cWhile the race is incredibly fluid at this early stage, it is going to take more than nipping at the heels of more relevant first-tier candidates to really move poll numbers.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of, Carly Fiorina has been fond of slamming Hillary Clinton and drawing comparisons between their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, which has earned her some headlines in her first months of the campaign.\n\nBut in the run-up to the final week before the debate, Fiorina\u2019s campaign is taking the more conventional route, introducing the candidate to voters and traveling to early states like Iowa, which she will visit this week.\n\nFor his part, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who, thanks to Trump, no longer gets the \u201cmost blunt\u201d award in the field, told reporters on Monday he wasn\u2019t worried about getting into the debate.\n\n\u201cThe source of my confidence is that the people behind me aren\u2019t gonna catch me and I\u2019m more likely to move up than I will to move down,\u201d Christie said during a campaign stop in South Carolina, according to a transcript of his remarks. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll be there. I know there are some who hope I\u2019m not. But, I\u2019ll be there. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\nBut Horwitt said, at the end of the day, getting up in the polls and staying there all comes down to the basics.\n\n\u201cIt comes back to the fundamentals that separate first-tier from lower-tier candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney, organization, and a uniquely clear and compelling rationale for your own candidacy.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:29.876+0000"}
{"entityId": 1525, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The U.S. military spent decades pivoting away from its Cold War stance. Now the Pentagon is less prepared than it has been in generations for a confrontation with Russia.\n\nThere\u2019s an old saying in the military that we\u2019re always training for the last war, so fixated on the lessons of our most recent conflict that we\u2019re blind to the emerging threat.\n\nFor years, that last war was the Cold War, and the emerging threat was the insurgents of Iraq and Afghanistan. Slowly, painfully, eventually, the military reoriented itself. The result? After more than two decades of post Cold War re-alignment, the military is less prepared than it has been in generations for a confrontation with Russia.\n\nNo one in Washington is calling for the U.S. to go to war over Crimea and there are plenty of reasons why, at this point, military intervention could be a dangerous and foolhardy course. But if circumstances change and political leaders start looking to the military or the bargaining power that comes from a credible threat of force, they will find their options severely limited.\n\nOver the course of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq soldiers and marines have trained for maneuvering and fighting in small units over the landscape of the Middle East. Counter-insurgency (\u201cCOIN\u201d) doctrine, which stresses engagement with local civilian populations and tactics for fighting loosely organized forces employing light weapons, has become the military\u2019s new bible. It\u2019s about as far away as you can get from the principles used in the Cold War.\n\nAccording to retired General David Deptula, who served as the Air Force\u2019s top intelligence officer, \u201cwe\u2019ve been focused on the far left end of the spectrum of operations,\u201d by which he means the protracted, low-intensity conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. But, he says, \u201cif we want to maintain superpower status we need to be prepared to succeed across the full range of operations, not just the left end of it.\u201d\n\nEven the few strategists that weren\u2019t pre-occupied by Iraq and Afghanistan were planning for the much-touted Asia pivot, envisioning a future, one they\u2019d argue is still looming, defined by Chinese hegemony. Russia, meanwhile, was considered by many to be an historical relic; still big enough to wield real power but no longer capable of threatening U.S. vital interests and a second or third order afterthought when evaluating threats the military needed to plan for.\n\n\u201cFor years there have been only a handful of people consistently talking about Russia and China building highly advanced systems for use against our \u2018Cold-War era\u2019 aircraft, missiles and ships,\u201d Deptula says.\n\nHe\u2019s talking about himself and some of his closest confidants at the Air Force, who pushed for continued production of high-end weaponry like the F-22 stealth fighter\u2014right when the Iraq insurgency was at its peak. It made Deptula and his gang seem like they were fantasizing about an imaginary enemy while the real bad guys were blowing up Marines in Fallujah. Understandably, Robert Gates, the Defense Secretary of the time, wanted the military to focus on the wars America was actually fighting at the moment. And so eventually, many of Deptula\u2019s colleagues\u2014including Gen. Michael \u201cBuzz\u201d Moseley, the Air Force\u2019s top officer\u2014were shown the door when they opposed Gates once too often. According to Deptula, \u201cthose people were ignored by [former Defense Secretary] Gates, and some were fired because they had the courage to speak truth to power.\u201d\n\nAs the White House and Pentagon planners consider what to do if Russia invades Eastern Ukraine or deploys its forces elsewhere in the region, the limited choices available reveal just how profoundly the military has changed since the Cold War.\n\nFor half a century, Cold War military strategy focused on containing Russia and winning in clashes between large conventional forces. On the ground, that strategy called for mass formations organized around tanks and heavy weaponry. In the skies it relied on dominance in Top Gun style style air-to-air fighting prowess, radar evading stealth technology, and powerful bombers that could drop massive munitions to destroy enemy armor and fortified installations.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, that strategy has been completely overhauled. Training and doctrine have focused on small unit tactics while new weapons and vehicles have been designed with squads in mind rather than divisions. Super-sophisticated dogfighters, like the $187 million-a-pop F-22, suddenly seemed too fancy to actually use. Instead, drones costing less than a tenth the price littered the skies over Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nBut those drones are useless against any military with a half-decent system for shooting down enemy aircraft. And Russian has one of the best air defenses on the planet.\n\n\n\n\u201cHopefully the situation with Russia and Ukraine will be a bucket of cold water on those who believe all we need to be able to do is counter-insurgency operations,\u201d Deptula told The Daily Beast.\n\nAnd now, there are signs that the U.S. Air Force\u2019s long-held technological advantage may be eroding.\n\nThe new generation of Russian fighter plane, the T-50, isn\u2019t yet fully operational but it \u201cwill be produced much sooner that Gates and his crowd predicted,\u201d Deptula says. He adds that \u201conce the T-50s are produced in sufficient numbers there won\u2019t be anything in the NATO fleet that can deal with them except the F-22s and F-35s.\u201d\n\nDavid Axe, the long-time military tech writer notes that the T-50, which can fire long-range missiles while flying both high and fast, may be able to \u201cexploit critical vulnerabilities in U.S. and allied forces and level the air power playing field for the first time in a generation.\u201d\n\nAn independent Australian think tank, Air Power Australia, drew a more severe conclusion. \u201cIf the United States does not fundamentally change its planning for the future of tactical air power, the advantage held for decades will be soon lost and American air power will become an artifact of history.\u201d\n\nWhile Russian aircraft rely on speed and long flight times, the U.S. fleet is largely built for stealth so it can evade detection and anti-air weapons to engage targets at closer ranges. But the stealth capability, is now being challenged by advances in Russia\u2019s radar detection platforms and anti-aircraft weapons.\n\n\u201cToday,\u201d Deptula said, \u201cthe Russians have an extant significant advantage in their surface to air capabilities.\u201d And that with the exception of the U.S.\u2019s small number of highly advanced 5th generation aircraft, \u201cthe Russians can conduct area denial of any airspace within range of their defenses if they want to deny access to aircraft.\u201d\n\nSince 2001, the Pentagon has had good reasons for prioritizing spending for troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan over speculative needs for future wars, but a consequence has been that we now have what Deptula calls \u201ca geriatric Air Force and Navy fleet.\u201d\n\nNo one, not even Deptula, is suggesting that there\u2019s about to be some all-out showdown between Moscow\u2019s military and Washington. But it\u2019s possible that in the future American forces and allies could wind up in skirmishes with proxies equipped and trained by Russia. The U.S. used to be able to count on an overwhelming technological advantage. Tomorrow, maybe not.\n\nForeshadowing possible future scenarios, already Russia is outfitting the Assad regime in Syria while America runs guns to the rebels there. It\u2019s the Russian side that\u2019s winning.\n\nThe change isn\u2019t just about equipment or tactics, though, American forces trained in counter-insurgency who are stationed in Europe could still be deployed to hold the line against Russian advances. But there are drastically fewer forces left in Europe available to be called upon in such an event.\n\nAn analysis of Defense cuts published by the conservative American Enterprise Institute in 2013 reported that \u201cthe Army alone has closed 100 installations in Europe since 2003 and plans on returning an additional 47 installations to host nations by 2015.\u201d The same report notes, \u201cthe Navy has also been consolidating and decreasing its European bases\u201d and \u201csince 1990, the Air Force has reduced aircraft and forces stationed in Europe by 75 percent.\u201d Addressing the future of America\u2019s military footprint in Europe, the paper concludes that the Pentagon is \u201cplanning to continue reducing the US presence in Europe by approximately 15 percent over the coming decade.\u201d\n\nThe military can\u2019t be equally prepared for every threat and if its focus has been on counter-insurgency, that\u2019s because those are the wars we\u2019ve been fighting for the past twelve years.\n\nGenerations of veterans who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan have been raised and bled on COIN doctrine but, as combat demands, they have also learned how to be agile. Individual leaders on the battlefield are able to adapt quickly; it\u2019s the military bureaucracy that\u2019s like a tank: a slow, immensely powerful machine that\u2019s only capable of plotting one course at a time. Quick turns are not possible.\n\nWithout many viable military options to counter Russian aggression what\u2019s left for U.S. leaders seeking to punish Russia and assure our NATO allies that we\u2019ll protect them? Cunning diplomacy, maybe.\n\nCrimea is Russian now; that\u2019s not changing any time soon. Condemning the invasion and the fixed terms of the referendum have no more bearing on the current situation than the reasons Russia gave for annexing Crimea\u2014some of them legitimate\u2014ultimately had to do with the duplicity and force they used to take it.\n\nThe real question, and the subtext in much of the current talk about Crimea, is whether Russia will stop there or proceed to further conquests.\n\nDespite it\u2019s show of force in Crimea, Moscow has a lot to lose if the conflict broadens and draws in the U.S. and NATO. Russia has gas to sell to Europe, oligarchs counting on feeling comfortable in their London townhouses, a new middle class looking for normalcy that\u2019s already taken to the streets in protest, and the memory of Chechnya, a brutal war that took thousands of lives, fresh in the national memory.\n\nIf U.S. officials can present a deal that satisfies American aims while appealing to Russia\u2019s self-interest, they may be able to prevent a larger conflict.

{"entityId": 1526, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Members of the President\u2019s Intelligence Review Group declare that playing defense by alerting the public to hacks is the best response when situations like Heartbleed occur.\n\nWhen word spread last week about the greatest cyberspace vulnerability in years, the aptly named Heartbleed vulnerability, the first question that many asked was \u201cDid NSA know?\u201d Because of the prior revelations about NSA activity, there is now a natural suspicion among many citizens that the NSA would be using such a weakness in the fabric of cyberspace to collect information. Bloomberg even reported that the NSA did know and had been exploiting the mistake in encryption. But actually no U.S. government agency was aware of the problem; they learned about it along with the rest of us. That is both reassuring and troubling.\n\nThe question remains, however, what if, in a similar case in the future, the NSA or some other government agency did learn about such a flaw in software? Should it be the NSA\u2019s decision to tell us about the problem? Should the government lean to offense, and use the vulnerability to create an exploit and collect information, or, instead, lean toward defense, alerting citizens and companies so that they can protect themselves from malicious actors who may also learn about the flaw?\n\nAlthough for some, the answer comes easily, it is in our minds a difficult decision. The temptation to stockpile vulnerabilities for offense is easy to understand. After all, what if you could use a software glitch to destroy machines that Iran is using to make nuclear bomb material? Or perhaps we can use a mistake in coding to get inside al Qaeda\u2019s communications and learn about their next attack before it happens, perhaps in time to stop it. In those hypothetical cases, what is the U.S. Government\u2019s chief responsibility? To protect us from nuclear proliferation or terrorism? Or, to patch up software that might be running critical infrastructure such as our banks, stock markets, electric power grid, or transportation systems?\n\nThe President\u2019s Intelligence Review Group recommended earlier this year that the default decision, the assumption, should be to lean toward defense. (Disclosure: We were two of the group\u2019s five members.) The government, upon learning of a software vulnerability, should alert us and act quickly with the IT industry to fix the error. We reasoned that if the U.S. government learns about a software glitch, others will too, and it would be wrong to knowingly let U.S. citizens, companies and critical infrastructure be vulnerable to hackers and foreign intelligence cyber spies. Usually, it is the U.S. who has the most to lose when there is a hole in the fabric of cyberspace. We rely upon information technology systems and control networks more than any other economy or society, and the potential damage that could be done to our country from malicious hacking could be devastating.\n\nWe also recommended that there be the opportunity for rare exceptions to the rule. If the government learns about a vulnerability in some obscure piece of software, not widely present on U.S. critical networks but running on the systems of some real threat (such as al Qaeda or Iran\u2019s nuclear program), the president ought to be able to authorize for a limited time the use of that knowledge to collect intelligence or even to cause destruction of threatening hardware.\n\nWe rely upon information technology systems and control networks more than any other economy or society, and the potential damage that could be done to our country from malicious hacking could be devastating.\n\nThat decision, however, should not be the NSA\u2019s to make alone. Balancing the offense/defense equities should be a White House call, made after having heard from all sides of the issue. Those in the government who worry about defending critical, private sector networks (the departments of Treasury, Homeland Security, Energy, Transportation) should have the opportunity to make their case that it would be better to defend ourselves than to hoard our knowledge of a cyber problem to attack other nations\u2019 networks.\n\nThe reality is that there will be very few cases where a strong argument could be made for keeping a software vulnerability secret. Even then, the issue would be not whether to tell the American people about the cyberspace flaw, but how soon to tell. The president, according to a White House statement last week, has decided to accept our recommendation. The Obama administration announced that, with very rare exceptions, when the U.S. government learns of a software vulnerability, it will work with the software companies involved and with users to patch the mistake as quickly as possible. That lean toward defense is, we believe, the right answer.\n\nGoing further, it should be the basis for an international norm of behavior by all nations and institutions. We create a more secure and useful global Internet if other nations, including China and Russia, adopt and implement similar policies. Because they are unlikely to do so any time soon, the Obama administration should also step up its efforts to defend America\u2019s cyberspace from those who play by different rules.\n\nRichard Clarke was a National Security official in the Bush, Clinton, and Bush administrations. Peter Swire was a White House official under Presidents Clinton and Obama, and now is a professor at the Scheller College of Business of the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Because, you know, priorities.\n\nReps. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) reintroduced a ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, a bill the Republican House had already passed in 2013. And in the Senate, David Vitter (R-La.)\u2014always a jarring champion for such moral crusades given the scandalous and, uh, detailed revelations that he frequented a DC prostitution ring\u2014introduced four bills restricting reproductive rights. One would bar Planned Parenthood from receiving federal funds for family planning work\u2014even though abortions make up only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s vital health services work, and Planned Parenthood is already barred from using federal dollars for abortions.\n\nAnother one of Vitter\u2019s bills would require all abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital\u2014which especially hurts rural abortion providers that aren\u2019t located hear hospitals. The mortality rate from colonoscopies (which do not require hospital admitting privileges) is 40 times higher than for abortions, but anyway. Vitter also has a bill would allow hospitals, doctors and nurses to refuse to participate in abortion-related care even in cases of an emergency\u2014which makes that \u201cadmitting privileges\u201d bill entirely disingenuous. And Vitter would also ban \u201csex-selective abortion,\u201d which is purely a fictional boogieman invented by anti-abortion opponents.\n\nJob creation, eh? The only jobs these bills will create are at advocacy organizations protesting these ridiculous infringements on reproductive freedom.\n\nThat is not the \u201cleadership\u201d for which the American people voted, nor the leadership our nation and our economy need.\n\nIn the 2014 midterm elections, Republicans nationwide deliberately feigned moderation on social issues while proclaiming how they would focus on the economy if elected. Republicans like Gov. Scott Walker in Wisconsin, Sen. Joni Ernst in Iowa and Sen. Cory Gardner in Colorado backed away from their prior anti-abortion fanaticism while campaigning. Ernst, for instance, said that her previous support for a pregnancy-restricting \u201cfetal personhood\u201d law in Iowa was \u201csimply a statement that I support life.\u201d The Washington Post accurately described this as her trying \u201cto cover her tracks.\u201d\n\nRepublicans largely ducked social issues \u2014and in the 11 principles the GOP outlined for its election strategy, only one vaguely referred to \u201cvalues\u201d lumping in \u201ctraditions of family, life, religious liberty, and hard work.\u201d The rest were about the economy, jobs, education and bread and butter issues. The kind of stuff, supposedly, Republicans would make their focus if elected.\n\nSo much for that.\n\nThis isn\u2019t what the American people voted for. In the 2014 election polls, the majority of voters said the economy is the most important issue facing the country \u2014 not abortion or any kind of social issue. And 50 percent of those who said the economy was their top issue voted for Republicans. Notably, 63 percent of voters overall said our economic system favors the rich\u2014and 35 percent of those voters backed Republicans as well. They\u2019re not looking for the GOP to pander to social conservatives. They\u2019re not looking for ideological crusades. They\u2019re looking for concrete, compromise-based solutions that create jobs and strengthen our economy, especially for working people. But what did the new Republican Congress give them? Five anti-abortion bills.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that, among 2014 voters, 52 percent said that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Many of those Americans voted for Republicans\u201424 percent of voters who think abortion should be \u201clegal in all cases\u201d voted for the GOP, as did 41 percent of voters who think abortion should be \u201clegal in most cases.\u201d Republicans are turning their back on these voters and the majority of the American people, 7 in 10 of whom other polls show support legal abortion.\n\nMitch McConnell\u2019s \u201cserious adults\u201d act like children who can\u2019t keep their hands out of the anti-abortion, reflexively right-wing, out-of-touch moral crusader cookie jar.

Bobby Jindal once called the stupid party into a party that is both stupid and useless is almost complete.\n\nBetween Wednesday\u2019s votes in favor of bills that put federal spending on autopilot through December 11 and arm and train Syrian rebels, the Republicans are no longer even pretending to offer a serious alternative to a status quo deeply at odds with their supposed political philosophy. That\u2019s not just bad for the GOP\u2019s political fortunes\u2014it\u2019s bad for the country. Why have two parties when they\u2019re effectively the same outfit?\n\nRepublicans have long talked a good game about wanting to cut the size, scope, and spending of government without ever really delivering the goods (see, for instance, the George W. Bush years). But these days, they can\u2019t even be bothered to fake it. Gone is any of the budget-cutting brio that animated not only Tea Party enthusiasts a few years back but incoming House leadership just a couple of months ago.\n\nThey can\u2019t be bothered to fight for even the smallest of trims. After Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was unexpectedly bounced in his June primary, his replacement Kevin McCarthy announced that he was ready to let the wasteful and corrupt Export-Import Bank (or Ex-Im) expire at the end of September. That was not only refreshing to hear, it seemed to signal that the GOP might actually start drawing out differences on economic policy between it and the Democratic Party. Maybe, just maybe, the party of Lincoln was finally getting serious about that total reboot they\u2019d promised after the 2012 elections.\n\nCreated by Franklin Roosevelt during the Depression, Ex-Im offers $150 billion of taxpayer-backed loans and other financing to foreign countries to buy American products. It has long been attacked by free traders as a blatant form of corporate welfare that subsidizes the purchase of airplanes made by Boeing, farm equipment by John Deere, heavy machinery by Caterpillar, and various products made by such struggling firms as General Electric. On the very weekend it was announced that McCarthy would replace Cantor in the House leadership, he was asked whether he would let Ex-Im expire. \u201cYes,\u201d McCarthy told Fox News, \u201cbecause it\u2019s something the private sector can be able to do.\u201d\n\nIn a two-party system, we\u2019re effectively down to one party that wants to keep spending essentially the same and to start a new war without having to go on the record as voting for it or against it.\n\nWell, that was then. Ex-Im funding will now be temporarily extended, and then the GOP will figure out a way to reauthorize it for another few years. After the midterms, look for stories talking up \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cimportant\u201d reforms that will do nothing to redirect the hyper-concentrated flow of Ex-Im funds to a single state (Washington, which pulls in over 40 percent of all disbursements).\n\nThen there\u2019s the resolution to arm and train \u201cmoderate\u201d Syrian rebels, so they can fight a two-front war against both the hideous Assad regime and the barbaric Islamic State. This was a an amendment to the continuing resolution and it passed easily by a vote of 273 to 156, with Republicans voting two-to-one in favor. It now goes to the Senate, where there will be a single vote on the whole megillah: regular government spending, plus the training dollars for our new rebel friends. It is expected to pass easily in the Senate.\n\nThe GOP, which claims to be the party that pledges maniacal fealty to the Constitution, can\u2019t be bothered to push for a declaration of war, but it\u2019s happy to shovel more borrowed money toward a dodgy group of Syrians. \u201cI frankly think the president\u2019s request is a sound one,\u201d Speaker of the House John Boehner told The Washington Times. The only real disagreement among Republicans is whether to put American soldiers on the ground to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria, which appears to be what Sen. John McCain is pushing for.\n\nAs the differences between the two parties are blunted, it\u2019s no wonder that Republican chances for retaking the Senate are evaporating faster than those anticipated federal surpluses in the early Aughts. \u201cDemocrats now have a 51 percent chance of holding the Senate,\u201d reports The Washington Post\u2019s Chris Cillizza, who notes that just a few months ago, the odds were better than 80 percent that the Republicans would pick up six seats to gain a majority in both houses of Congress.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 utter lack of temerity is somewhat understandable. Their leaders have long refused to commit to any real change, even when Tea Party fever was at its highest (the few times Republicans pushed for spending trims\u2014such as when the GOP called for cutting food stamps while growing farm subsidies\u2014have been less than inspiring). Much like Mitt Romney, who, spent five long years steadfastly refusing to name any major federal program he would cut, the current crop of party leaders is terrified of laying out any specific plans. Romney played defense all the way, as did Boehner upon becoming Speaker of the House.\n\nJust a couple of weeks before ascending to the big-boy chair in the House of Representatives in 2011, Boehner was asked to \u201cname a program right now that we could do without.\u201d His answer: \u201cI don\u2019t think I have one off the top of my head.\u201d\n\nYears later, at a time when President Obama has managed to turn off even his longtime fans in the press, the GOP still doesn\u2019t really have any answers or reforms or changes that it\u2019s willing to share with the voting public.\n\nIn a two-party system, we\u2019re effectively down to one party that wants to keep spending essentially the same and to start a new war without having to go on the record as voting for it or against it.

In his second term, he\u2019s making up for lost time. Earlier this year, he launched his \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper\u201d initiative aimed at boosting opportunities for boys and young men of color, and this week, he hosted 50 heads of state from Africa for a first ever U.S-Africa Summit aimed at building stronger ties with a continent where six of the 10 fastest growing economies are located.\n\nThree of the four former living presidents were in Washington to participate in various summit events, demonstrating, amazingly enough, that Obama may have to elbow his way into the Africa Club. Jimmy Carter has worked tirelessly to eradicate guinea worm disease; George W. Bush instituted the wildly popular PEPFAR (President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief); and Bill Clinton is often in Africa, promoting a range of projects from HIV prevention to reforestation through his global initiative.\n\n\u201cWhat Obama is doing fits under the headline, \u2018Despite the commitment of previous presidents, lots of work remains to be done to create a healthier economic relationship\u2019,\u201d says William Galston of the Brookings Institution. He notes that unlike the initiatives of his predecessors, which are largely humanitarian, Obama is carving out a niche for himself as \u201cthe proponent for and advocate for a new kind of economic relationship in the developing world.\u201d\n\nAnd like \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d Africa is a long-range project that offers a window into the kinds of issues that speak to Obama personally and will shape his post-presidency.\n\n\u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper\u201d is modeled after First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d campaign, which treats obesity among children as a serious health challenge. Key to the success of ensuring that such programs endure beyond Obama\u2019s presidency is involving corporate America in public-private partnerships. With two years to go in Obama\u2019s term, there is some unease over his prematurely easing into his post-presidency. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean he intends to do nothing,\u201d says Galston, \u201cbut it\u2019s pretty well known he\u2019s about given up on Congress.\u201d\n\nObama has begun talking almost wistfully about the longer term, and hoping his influence, his vision, will germinate the seeds for his successors to cultivate with a stronger hand and/or a kinder, gentler Congress. \u201cEverything he does now is geared to this idea that whatever initiatives he puts in place are going to come to greater fruition after he leaves office, and he will be remembered as the one who put them in motion,\u201d says historian Robert Dallek.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about race,\u201d Dallek told the Daily Beast, \u201cbut I took it as an expression of feeling on [Obama\u2019s] part that race is part of the resentment\u2026\u201d\n\nShould Hillary Clinton become the next president, it\u2019s quite logical that she or any Democrat for that matter would carry forward much of Obama\u2019s unfinished agenda. A GOP that lost three in a row might be chastened enough to cooperate, at least sometimes. Then again, if a Republican wins the presidency in \u201916, Obama will take the heat for the loss.\n\nObama has long argued that Republican obstructionism is to blame for the current paralysis in government. Congress\u2019 performance, leaving town for five weeks without providing funds or policy guidance to deal with the immigration crisis at the border, serves to vindicate Obama\u2019s view. \u201cAll he gets from Congress is negativism and carping,\u201d says Dallek. \u201cI think in a sense this deadlock in Congress gives him a greater sense of independence, of freedom to try to take initiatives that will have some progressive, instructive impact.\u201d\n\nDallek is among a small group of historians invited to the White House on an occasional basis to meet with Obama. He recalls at one point talking to Obama about the Tea Party and its anti-government rhetoric: \u201cI called it the politics of resentment, and he said, \u2018Bob, I think you\u2019re right, there\u2019s something subterranean about the way these people process things\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about race,\u201d Dallek told the Daily Beast, \u201cbut I took it as an expression of feeling on his part that race is part of the resentment, resentment of the fact that they feel they\u2019re being elbowed aside, not just by blacks, but by Hispanics, and Asians too.\u201d Asians voted for Obama in a higher percentage even than Hispanics, Dallek notes, adding, \u201cRace is never very far from the American experience.\u201d\n\nSensitive to the underlying dynamics of his election, Obama steered clear in his first term of anything overt that might stir those subterranean emotions. But now time is winding down, and he appears more willing to take risks. This could manifest itself in the executive action he has promised at summer\u2019s end to clarify the immigration status of tens of thousands and perhaps millions of immigrants, or in the tax issues that allow American corporations to shift their address overseas and stick taxpayers with the lost revenue.\n\nImmigration reform activists would like to see Obama as the Great Emancipator of the 21st century, following in Lincoln\u2019s footsteps. \u201cHe has to observe reasonably clear constitutional boundaries and statutory authority, and not hand a sword to his adversaries,\u201d cautions Galston. Whatever action Obama takes, he will get pushback from Republicans. As a constitutional lawyer, he must think he is on solid ground and has no choice but to act on his own or let the rest of his presidency fritter away.\n\nObama\u2019s legacy as the nation\u2019s first elected black president is ensured, and he has now put programs in place to carry that identity forward. But in the two years he has remaining, and with his leadership and effectiveness under assault, time is getting short to build the legacy he wants.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:31.599+0000"}

It\u2019s all about loyalty, she says.\n\nAs Donald Trump stood in the lobby of Trump Tower on Thursday afternoon and announced that, after much hesitation and taunting of the American conservative electorate, he solemnly swears to the Republican National Committee that he won\u2019t run as a third-party candidate, his biggest defender prepared to dutifully sing his praises on television.\n\n\u201cWell, I think that the fact that they actually asked him to sign the loyalty pledge just shows the strength of Donald Trump and just the sort of threat that he is,\u201d Katrina Campins remarked on CNN following Trump\u2019s press conference. \u201cWhat I love about Donald Trump is he stands firm in his truth. It\u2019s really the first time in a long time that I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019m an American.\u201d\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Campins would make an unlikely political pundit. She is a self-described \u201creal estate mogul\u201d who lives in Miami but lists her location on Twitter and Facebook as \u201cPeace Within.\u201d She is one of the few candidate surrogates who has a topless photo on the Internet. Her ambition, judging by her personal website, is to build a lifestyle brand. But she possesses a unique qualification: She knows Trump, having been a contestant on Season 1 of The Apprentice, the reality show that helped to cement the Republican frontrunner\u2019s mainstream celebrity.\n\nWhile Trump has found myriad defenders on talk radio, where conservatives like Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham who echo Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant beliefs rule the conversation, among the Beltway pundit class he has few fans of equal prominence willing to come to his aid.\n\nTo make up for this, he\u2019s enlisted the most Trump-like surrogates imaginable: Reality TV celebrities he created himself.\n\nIn January 2004, The Apprentice premiered on NBC. The premise was simple: New York\u2019s most successful real estate magnate would attempt to find a suitable young person with entrepreneurial spirit to whom he could pass the torch, a one-year contract as the leader of one of his companies, and a $250,000 salary, like a transparent Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nSitting in the back of a limousine, Trump introduced himself in the show\u2019s first episode. \u201cI\u2019m the largest real estate developer in New York,\u201d he bragged. He got out of his limousine and stepped into a Trump-branded helicopter. \u201cAs the master, I want to pass along my knowledge to somebody else\u2026Who will succeed, and who will fail? Who will be The Apprentice?\u201d\n\nNot Katrina Campins, it turned out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Katrina Campins,\u201d she told the reality TV-viewing public as she walked dramatically into the lobby of Trump Tower in the same episode, \u201cand I rank in the top 3 percent of Realtors nationwide and I\u2019m 23 years old.\u201d The camera cut to Campins standing next to a wrought-iron gate outside a mansion she presumably sold. By the spring, after insinuating that two fellow contestants were having an affair and complaining about being cast as a \u201csexpot,\u201d Campins was booted from the show.\n\nBut she stayed in touch with Trump after her Apprentice days ended and, in 2014, she joined Trump International Realty.\n\nIn an interview after her CNN appearance on Thursday, Campins told me she didn\u2019t learn much about real estate from America\u2019s future president, but she learned something very valuable: \u201cthe art of branding.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, loyalty is very big to Trump, and it\u2019s very big to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe definitely taught me the importance of branding and marketing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a master brander. I mean, perfect example now: He doesn\u2019t have to pay for all his press. It\u2019s just free press. Nobody can compete with that.\u201d\n\nCampins has appeared on CNN \u201cprobably like five or six times\u201d since Trump\u2019s June announcement, she guessed. \u201cI do it, like, once or twice a week depending on the topic.\u201d\n\nShe has defended Trump against charges of racism and misogyny, and attempted to explain away his off-color comments.\n\nAs a Cuban-American woman, she often says, she just thinks Trump\u2019s statements have been \u201cmisconstrued\u201d by the media.\n\nAsked plainly if he is a racist, she told me \u201cno.\u201d Asked if he is hateful, she said the same thing.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s feelings about women, she complained that the horrible things Trump said about Rosie O\u2019Donnell (that she is a \u201cpig,\u201d for starters) were not the Real Trump, and the media should know the difference between when he is being real and when he is just doing something for entertainment\u2019s sake. \u201cThat was Trump the entertainer speaking,\u201d she explained. He wouldn\u2019t say that now, she said, while running for office.\n\nWhen I noted that Trump had also said horrible things about Fox News journalist Megyn Kelly, not only recently but while a candidate for office, Campins said, \u201cThat\u2019s the media\u201d making something into nothing.\n\nTrump hadn\u2019t really suggested that Kelly might be menstruating when she asked him tough questions at the debate, Campins told me. \u201cI think it was a boxing\u2014uh, he was referring to a term in boxing and everything got turned around.\u201d\n\nCampins is not paid by CNN, she\u2019s quick to point out, and says she actually has a lot to lose by voicing her support for Trump publicly. She also contends that she is not benefiting monetarily from Trump, despite working for Trump International Realty. \u201cI\u2019m an independent contractor,\u201d she replied icily when I brought it up. \u201cI have my own brand. I don\u2019t need anybody else\u2019s brand, you understand?\u201d\n\nOn August 10, Trump tweeted at Campins, \u201cThank you so much for the wonderful statements you made about me on TV. Also, keep up the great work!\u201d She replied, \u201cMy pleasure. I\u2019m just speaking the truth.\u201d She included as punctuation two emoji: a happy blushing face and hands-folded-in-prayer.\n\nCampins says she doesn\u2019t care about generating attention for herself. Still, when I mention that Trump tweeted at her once, she corrects me, saying: \u201cWell, he tweeted twice, and every time I go on air, basically, just appreciation for standing behind what I believe, which is very much in line with what he believes. You know, loyalty is very big to Trump, and it\u2019s very big to me.\u201d\n\nCampins\u2014who has the tagline \u201cCENTERED IN GOD\u201d on her website and posts selfies on Instagram captioned \u201cnamaste\u201d\u2014says she believes talking up Trump\u2019s candidacy and explaining away his comments, like that undocumented Mexican immigrants are \u201crapists,\u201d is noble work. \u201cI\u2019m a voice,\u201d she told me. \u201cIf I can speak for those Americans who don\u2019t have a voice, more power to it. It\u2019s not about me. I wish more people used media that way. That\u2019s what media is to me. It\u2019s an instrument to vocalize important messaging.\u201d\n\nCampins told me she and Trump talk, but not about what she says on TV. \u201cI speak from my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody tells me what to say.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t reveal what, exactly, they discuss, saying only, \u201cThat\u2019s no one\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s dominance of the Republican primary field\u2014a Monmouth University poll released Thursday shows him with 30 percent support nationally\u2014has turned the entire democratic process into a cross between a reality show and a horror movie.\n\nTrump is, in words so often uttered by reality TV contestants, not here to make friends. He thrives on and constantly produces conflict, which makes for terrific television. On Thursday alone, for example, he picked fights with Jeb Bush, Rand Paul, and Chris Christie.\n\nIn a political universe where going off-script in any way is seen as potential suicide and giving the press anything to work with that hasn\u2019t been vetted by consultants and pollsters and psychics and who knows who else is a risk, Trump just doesn\u2019t care. He is rewarded for his recklessness with around-the-clock cable news coverage and untold numbers of reporters, like this one, devoting thousands of words to his exploits.\n\n\u201cThere is no malice in Donald Trump\u2019s heart,\u201d Omarosa Manigault, another Apprentice Season 1 star, told me. Manigault was Campins\u2019s roommate on the show and calls her \u201cmy kitty cat.\u201d The pair appeared on CNN together recently to defend Trump.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a misogynist and he\u2019s not a racist,\u201d Manigault, who is a Democrat and worked in the Bill Clinton White House, said. And he\u2019s not, she argued, responsible for turning the Republican primary into reality TV. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do that. Let\u2019s go back to Howard Dean, let\u2019s go back to Barack Obama,\u201d she laughed. When people say \u201creality TV,\u201d she told me, she thinks they\u2019re talking about \u201cculture with a lowercase \u2018c.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd if we\u2019re talking about lowbrow culture, what about Ronald Reagan? \u201cThey thought he was trivial. The things that people are saying about Donald Trump are very similar to what they said about Ronald Reagan and Jesse Ventura and Sonny Bono,\u201d Manigault noted.\n\nAll that said, Manigault doesn\u2019t know whether she would vote for Trump were he to win the Republican nomination. \u201cIt comes with so much weight,\u201d she said of casting a vote for president. \u201cThis is the most important position in the world!\u201d\n\nBut \u201che sent me a tweet last week.

There\u2019d be the sound of thunder and perhaps a puff of smoke, and from the wings, God would appear. He or She would, over the course of the three acts, take on numerous corporeal forms\u2014white man, black woman, Asian man, Arab woman, et cetera\u2014but in each guise would admonish the speaker: \u201cNo, asshole. You\u2019re totally wrong. How do I know? Because I\u2019m God, and you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\nThe idea came to me, of course, because of life\u2019s endless pageant of moments when one wishes life really worked that way. But I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever wished it more than I did two days ago, when Jim DeMint, the ex-senator and Heritage Foundation head who defines the words casuist and charlatan and braggart and bloviator and about 262 others that are worse, said that the federal government of the United States did nothing to end slavery. The salient words:\n\nWell the reason that the slaves were eventually freed was the Constitution, it was like the conscience of the American people. Unfortunately, there were some court decisions like Dred Scott and others that defined some people as property, but the Constitution kept calling us back to \u2018all men are created equal and we have inalienable rights\u2019 in the minds of God. But a lot of the move to free the slaves came from the people, it did not come from the federal government. It came from a growing movement among the people, particularly people of faith, that this was wrong. People like Wilberforce who persisted for years because of his faith and because of his love for people. So no liberal is going to win a debate that big government freed the slaves.\n\nPlease, I beg of you, don\u2019t do DeMint the honor of thinking him merely stupid. He\u2019s probably that, in some way. Certainly those sentences add up to a mountain of stupid, a Himalayan range of it. Yet at the same time, a statement this insane can\u2019t be propelled merely by stupidity. A denial of reality this whole, this pure, requires, I think, some thought, some premeditation. Dwell with me on this for the moment.\n\nToday\u2019s radical conservatives like DeMint want to destroy government. This means in the first instance discrediting everything government does in the present. That, we\u2019re all plenty familiar with. It\u2019s a lot of what we fight about all the time.\n\nBut the project also includes history\u2014proving that nothing good that ever happened in history was done by the government. Oh, they might grant you a war here or there, these wingers. They\u2019re OK with war (when we win them\u2014when we\u2019ve lost them, that was of course the liberals\u2019 fault). But nothing else.\n\nOften, this is easy enough. Example: The great post-war prosperity boom and middle-class expansion. We on my side say: unionization, massive public investments, a tax rate that kept the coffers full, a few other things. DeMint and his type can\u2019t have that, so they say: American ingenuity, a free-market system that encouraged initiative, no big bloated welfare state yet, etc. That\u2019s a simple one. Left and right offer competing narratives, and to most people, parts of each probably sound plausible.\n\nBut then you get to trickier matters. How, as a radical conservative today, and especially a Southern one, and especially one from the state (South Carolina) that started the Civil War (first to advance nullification, first to secede, first shots fired), are you supposed to explain that war? And how are you supposed to explain slavery? Tough ones. If you ever visit any of those crackpot websites I look at sometimes, you\u2019ve seen, for example, the commonly advanced idea that the Civil War wasn\u2019t really about slavery, it was about states\u2019 rights and economics and so on. I guarantee you that notion will show up pretty quickly in this very comment thread.\n\nBut that explains only the war\u2019s beginning, not its end. I had not heard, until DeMint\u2019s comments here, their theory on the war\u2019s end, and more deliciously on slavery\u2019s. So it was \u201cthe conscience of the American people\u201d that ended it. And the Constitution, which \u201ckept calling us back to \u2018all men are created equal and we have inalienable rights.\u2019\u201d And William Wilberforce. But whatever it was, it wasn\u2019t \u201cbig government.\u201d\n\nDeMint doesn\u2019t have a legitimate difference of opinion. He has a wholly ideological one, designed not to spur historical debate but to justify his miserly posture toward contemporary politics.\n\nInteresting interpretation, eh? DeMint\u2019s \u201cconscience of the American people\u201d x\u2019s out of history the Emancipation Proclamation, which strikes me as an act of the federal government (a presidential order); also the Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery and, as an amendment to the Constitution, was surely an action of the government. It also x\u2019s out the war itself, fought to the end, no matter what today\u2019s Confederate revisionists say, to wipe out slavery once and for all.\n\nAs for the Constitution, well, there\u2019s the fact that the words DeMint quotes appear not in the Constitution but the Declaration of Independence, but there are bigger problems here than that. If Jim DeMint had been alive in 1860, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that he\u2019d have gone with the flow in his state, correct? So he\u2019d have supported secession. And, big cheese that he is, he\u2019d have likely played some role in creating the Confederate States of America. And in turn he\u2019d likely have signed the Confederate Constitution, thus pledging his loyalty to a document that explicitly prohibited the Confederate government or its several states from interfering in slave ownership in any way, including a specific provision stating that any territories the CSA gained via war or any other means would become slaveholding states. That would have been Jim DeMint\u2019s Constitution, not the one you and I heed.\n\nFinally, this Wilberforce business. They love Wilberforce, today\u2019s rad-cons. He was a devout Christian, you see, and a conservative; and yet at the same time a stern abolitionist. What a useful combination! Invoking Wilberforce allows conservatives like DeMint to pretend that he, not Calhoun, is their moral lodestar and inspiration. It\u2019s somewhat problematic for them that while Wilberforce did indeed fight slavery, he did so in England, where he actually lived, not in America. And only up until 1833, when he died. Besides which the fiery abolitionists in America, William Lloyd Garrison and so forth, were quite religious too, but on the political left.\n\nThere is such a thing as having a legitimate difference of opinion on a question of history. Was Napoleon the embodiment or the corruption of the French Revolution, to take an obvious example\u2014historians will argue that one till the end of time. But DeMint doesn\u2019t have a legitimate difference of opinion. He has a wholly ideological one, designed not to spur historical debate but to justify his miserly posture toward contemporary politics.\n\nAnd so every sentence that came out of his mouth was just utter nonsense. But not just that--premeditated, pernicious, and malicious nonsense, spun to serve contemporary ends like fighting the delivery of health coverage to millions. Physicians have boards to answer to, lawyers the local bar; but in politics and media, there\u2019s no panel that can police this drivel and declare DeMint unfit for participation in public discourse. And so he gets to say these utterly insane things but still get quoted in the papers as if he were a serious person. And the rest of us just have to endure him. God, if you\u2019re there, now would be a good time to show up.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:32.722+0000"}
{"entityId": 1532, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Anti-abortion activists, riding high after Republicans\u2019 November sweep, call the new 20-week ban, which is back in the House, a \u2018common-ground bill.\u2019 Pro-choicers say that\u2019s hogwash.\n\nThe anti-abortion super PAC, Women Speak Out, helped boost the number of pro-life women Republicans to 22 in the House and 3 in the Senate. \u201cNow begins the hard work of getting a return on that investment,\u201d says Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List. Founded after the 1992 \u201cyear of the woman\u201d sent a record number of pro-choice women to Congress, the SBA List spent years trying to build credibility to counter Planned Parenthood and the network of groups on the other side. The 2014 election results highlighted this younger generation of activists as major players in what promises to be a lively revival of abortion-based politics and policies.\n\n\u201cAbortion-centered feminism is dead,\u201d Dannenfelser told a crowded press conference at the National Press Club on Thursday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s the most important thing I\u2019ll say today.\u201d She noted the casualties on the Democratic side, a string of senators who campaigned on women-centric platforms, heralding the move away from \u201ctraditional Jane Fonda feminism\u201d to the historic legislative moment that SBA List and its allies believe exists with a \u201ccommon-ground\u201d bill that would ban abortion after 20 weeks.\n\nRepublicans in the newly sworn-in House introduced the \u201cPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act\u201d on the first day of Congress, and a vote on the measure is scheduled for January 22, when tens of thousands of activists will be in Washington for the annual March for Life rally. The measure will easily pass the GOP-controlled House, but its fate in the Senate is less certain. Reaching a filibuster-proof 60 votes is a big hurdle, and any bill that reached President Obama\u2019s desk would face a veto.\n\nUndeterred, Dannenfelser cited the history of the Partial Birth Abortion ban, which President Bush signed into law in 2003 after its passage in some 30 states and an earlier veto by President Clinton. Thirteen states have passed pain-capable or similar legislation, with more expected to follow. A Washington Post poll in July 2013 found that 64 percent of Americans would support a 20-week ban; 27 percent would not. The United States is one of only seven nations that allow abortion beyond 20 weeks, Dannenfelser said, citing North Korea, China, Singapore, Vietnam, Canada, and the Netherlands.\n\nWhat Dannenfelser calls common ground is anathema to pro-choice groups. In a dueling press conference, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards briefed reporters at the National Press Club on Wednesday. She called the 2014 midterms a \u201cnon-voting election\u201d with turnout of 36 percent, a record low. In every competitive Senate race, \u201canti-choice politicians ran from their record,\u201d she said, and in some cases presented themselves as champions of women\u2019s rights.\n\nIn the lead-up to 2016, anti-abortion activists have staked out ground they can potentially win on, putting supporters of abortion rights on the defensive.\n\n\u201cOne of Cory Gardner\u2019s mail pieces looked like we made it,\u201d Richards exclaimed, holding up a bright-pink flier bearing a picture of a birth control packet so reporters could see it. The Republican handily defeated Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado in part by downplaying his advocacy for \u201cpersonhood\u201d legislation, which would confer full constitutional rights on a fetus from the moment of conception; Gardner also called for the over-the-counter sale of birth control pills. Asked if common ground could be found there, Richards appeared dubious, pointing out it wasn\u2019t that long ago that insurance companies did not cover birth control. \u201cWe can thank Viagra for that,\u201d she added. Now that insurance companies have been shamed into covering birth control, Richards said she does not want women to lose insurance coverage if the pills are sold over the counter.\n\nThe anti-abortion movement is in the spotlight now as restrictive measures are weighed on Capitol Hill, and GOP-controlled legislatures and state Houses around the country enact more anti-choice measures. Asked about regulations that have forced dozens of abortion clinics to close in Texas, Dannenfelser defended the regulations as a safety precaution that Planned Parenthood should applaud, instead of condemn, even as she conceded, \u201cEvery abortion clinic should close, yes.\u201d\n\nA reporter noted that closing every abortion clinic would not end the demand for abortion, that women would try to abort on their own or would go to substandard clinics. \u201cWould you prefer that to having legal clinics?\u201d the reporter asked. For a moment, Dannenfelser seemed to be caught off balance. The anti-choice movement does not like to be confronted with the end goal of many of its adherents, which is overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that made abortion legal.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have consensus now where we can think of closing every abortion clinic,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI\u2019m alluding to a vision of what life could be like where every child conceived is welcomed to the world.\u201d Pressed on Roe, which Supreme Court watchers say is one vote away on the nine-member court from being overturned, she declined to predict when that might happen. A Republican winning the presidency in 2016 might hasten the day, but in the meantime the strategy is, according to Dannenfelser, \u201cInstead of direct overturning in one day, a refining downward until Roe becomes irrelevant.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court in Roe ruled abortion legal until \u201cviability,\u201d defined as 24 weeks, or when a fetus could survive outside the womb. Given the poll numbers favoring a 20-week ban, the burden is on Planned Parenthood and its allies to convince the public that this decision should be made between a patient and her doctor, not by a legislature. \u201cThe right to abortion is seen in this country to be a fundamental right of women,\u201d says Richards. Yet in the lead-up to 2016, anti-abortion activists have staked out ground they can potentially win on, putting supporters of abortion rights on the defensive for now in this fight with no end.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:32.985+0000"}

But these comments, made Wednesday night in New York City, were particularly unbound.\n\nThe vice president was being honored by Vital Voices, a women\u2019s rights charity, at their event \u201ccelebrat[ing] men who combat violence against women.\u201d Biden spoke about standing up for women\u2014both in his personal and professional lives. In doing so, the vice president delighted the audience with a personal anecdote from his childhood as Joey Biden.\n\n\u201cI remember coming back from Mass on Sunday,\u201d Biden began. \u201cAlways the big treat was, we\u2019d stop at the donut shop\u2026We\u2019d get donuts, and my dad would wait in the car. As I was coming out, my sister [Valerie] tugged on me and said, \u2018That\u2019s the boy who kicked me off my bicycle.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I went home\u2014we only lived about a quarter mile away\u2014and I got on my bicycle and rode back, and he was in the donut shop.\u201d\n\nBiden remembered the boy was in a physically vulnerable position: \u201cleaning down on one of those slanted counters.\u201d\n\nSensing his opportunity, Joey Biden pounced: \u201cI walked up behind him and smashed his head next to the counter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not recommending it,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI walked up behind him and smashed his head next to the counter.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis father grabbed me, and I looked at his son and said, \u2018If you ever touch my sister again, I\u2019ll come back here again and I\u2019ll kill your son.\u2019 Now, that was a euphemism. I thought I was really, really in trouble\u2026 My father never once raised his hand to any one of his children\u2014never once\u2014and I thought I was in trouble. He pulled me aside and said, \u2018Joey, you shouldn\u2019t do that, but I\u2019m proud of you, son.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe point of the story, Biden informed his audience as he accepted his \u201cVoice of Solidarity\u201d award, was that he was raised to know that it was necessary to \u201cspeak up and speak out\u201d to correct wrongdoings. (Full disclosure: The event was held at the headquarters of IAC, the corporate parent of The Daily Beast.) Vital Voices in 2013 took over funds from the Women In The World foundation which originated at The Daily Beast.\n\n\n\nIn telling the tale of testosterone and a truly American desire for justice joining to propel him on his bicycle to defeat the Bad Guy in the donut shop, the vice president appeared to merge with The Onion\u2019s caricature of him\u2014achieving a moment of Peak Biden, or the bro-like state of being visibly pleased with the degree to which you do not give a damn.\n\nIt would be difficult to imagine another politician of Biden\u2019s stature telling this story. Biden, after all, is known for his unbuttoned comments from the podium.\n\nHe described then-candidate Obama as \u201cthe first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that\u2019s a storybook, man.\u201d\n\nHe told a partially black crowd of Mitt Romney in 2012: \u201cHe is going to let the big banks once again write their own rules, unchain Wall Street. He is going to put y\u2019all back in chains.\u201d\n\nAnd, during his 1988 presidential campaign, he plagiarized the life story of British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock and tried to pass it off as his own.\n\nWhich is a shame, in a sense. If Wednesday\u2019s night\u2019s remarks were any guide, Biden appears to have had a rather colorful upbringing of his own.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:33.137+0000"}

Thad Cochran\u2019s wife, Rose, who is bedridden with severe dementia, has lived since 2000. Kelly then posted a video on the Internet of Rose Cochran, with a pro-McDaniel and anti-Cochran voiceover. The video was taken down within a few hours but, in that short time, was apparently noticed. On Friday, Kelly was arrested and charged with exploitation of a vulnerable adult. He is being held in Madison, Mississippi, on $100,000 bond.\n\nBut questions are piling up about what the McDaniel campaign knew of Kelly\u2019s actions and when it knew it. In a voicemail released by the Cochran campaign, McDaniel\u2019s campaign manager, Melanie Sojourner, initially says, \u201cWe don\u2019t know this guy. We have no idea who he is.\u201d But then she appears to contradict herself, saying: \u201cThere was some stuff several months ago where this guy was doing some insane stuff online. We found out about it and Chris and I immediately sicced a bunch of volunteers trying to find out who was the source of just a lot of ugly rumors and nasty stuff and we wanted it squashed.\u201d\n\nAnd in an email obtained by Breitbart, Sojourner seems to be aware of the video, writing that it must come down on April 26, the day it was posted. \u201cWe have to know we cannot engage in these attacks,\u201d she writes.\n\nThe McDaniel campaign originally denied any prior knowledge of the taping. At the time, a campaign spokesman said the candidate had not been fully briefed, but the campaign has put out several different timelines of what it knew and when. On Monday, Kelly\u2019s wife told the Hattiesburg American that her husband took the video down after a request from McDaniel, or as Clayton Kelly referred to him at the time, \u201cthe big man.\u201d\n\nIf the Tea Party hopeful had been straightforward from the beginning, the damage might have been minimized.\n\nThe campaign backed out of a scheduled meeting Monday with the editorial board of the Jackson Clarion-Ledger, the newspaper that first broke the story of the arrest, citing a conflict with what the paper implies may be a fictitious campaign event.\n\nThe campaign denies any connection to Kelly\u2019s actions, and while the Madison Police Department has said it is investigating a conspiracy, no link has been discovered. The McDaniel campaign declined to respond questions from The Daily Beast about whether anyone on the campaign had retained legal counsel as a result of the investigation.\n\nThe pressing problem for the McDaniel campaign, though, isn\u2019t its possible connections to Kelly\u2014it\u2019s the bungled response to the story. After all, Occam\u2019s razor suggests that if a campaign is going to be involved in taking a bizarre photo of another candidate\u2019s senile wife, it likely wouldn\u2019t use a blogger named Constitutional Clayton to do so. But by initially denying any knowledge of the video and then repeatedly altering its timeline, McDaniel\u2019s campaign looks like the Keystone Kops. It\u2019s entirely defensible if staffers found out that \u201cthis guy was doing some insane stuff online\u201d and then tried to stop him. Taking more than a day and several iterations of a story to acknowledge it is where things get dicey.\n\nThe McDaniel affair isn\u2019t anything vaguely like Watergate\u2014after all, Constitutional Clayton makes G. Gordon Liddy seem like Karl Rove\u2014but by appearing to bungle a cover-up, the Mississippi candidate seems to have made the same tactical mistake as Nixon. If the Tea Party hopeful had been straightforward from the beginning, the damage might have been minimized. Instead, he\u2019s fueled a story that is likely to continue until the June 3 primary and may do significant harm to McDaniel\u2019s hopes of toppling a six-term incumbent like Cochran.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:33.344+0000"}

A new political gold rush has begun.\n\nAnd it\u2019s going to be messy.\n\nFor the past four years, a state that has made an industry of valorizing the young and the new has been overseen by Gov. Jerry Brown, 76, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 81, and Sen. Barbara Boxer at 74.\n\nBut on Thursday Boxer triggered a Golden State political earthquake, announcing that she would not seek a fifth term in 2016.\n\nAdvisers to Kamala Harris, the state\u2019s popular attorney general, have already begun reaching out to possible staffers and campaign bundlers, according to one source familiar with the outreach.\n\nHarris has made criminal-justice reform her signature issue and has aggressively taken on banks over improper foreclosures in her one term as the state\u2019s chief law-enforcement officer.\n\nBoxer\u2019s retirement before 2016 had been long predicted\u2014although the timing of it on Thursday was so sudden that it even caught her longtime friend House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi unprepared\u2014and with Brown termed out in 2018, and Feinstein likely to retire when her term is up that year as well, the Golden State looks set for a political sea change.\n\nSome California Democrats have hoped the potential vacancies would permit the three most well-known office holders in the state to divide the opening seats among them.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, Harris would take one seat, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa would take another, and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom would grab a third.\n\nBut since those rosy scenarios were first floated, the California political scene has grown more crowded. Eric Garcetti succeeded Villaraigosa and has received high marks in his first year and a half on the job. Then there\u2019s hedge-fund billionaire Tom Steyer, who donated $74 million in 2014 to Democrats who pledged to tackle climate change, and has refused to rule out a career in politics.\n\nRep. Xavier Becerra emerged as a progressive champion in the House of Representatives but has seen his career there increasingly stalled as Democrats fall deeper into the minority.\n\nSo far, all the players seemed to be willing to wait their turn.\n\nOn Thursday, Garcetti ruled himself out of the race to succeed Boxer. \u201cI love my job and I love my city and I am committed to the work here,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI will not run for Sen. Boxer\u2019s seat.\u201d Newsom will likely be out if Harris runs since the two are considered allies, California political insiders said.\n\nHarris is unlikely to see a challenge from Villaraigosa, either.\n\nFour days before Boxer\u2019s announcement, Villaraigosa told the Los Angeles Daily News that he was leaning toward a campaign for governor. \u201cHaving been a legislator and a mayor, I particularly enjoy being a chief executive,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Democrats want to spill blood on this,\u201d said John Thomas, a California Democratic consultant. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be, \u2018Who wants to be governor, who wants to be senator, who can wait. Let\u2019s sort this thing out.\u2019 It\u2019s easy to imagine Kamala Harris horse-trading her way into being the front-runner. The question then becomes how do you make sure you are first in line in 2018.\u201d\n\nBut even without an obviously competitive Democratic challenger, Harris would still have the challenge of the election process in California.\n\nThe Golden State employs a top-two primary system, which means that the two highest vote-getters, regardless of party, will face off in the general election in 2016. This could provide opening to a Democrat not in the Harris/Villaraigos/Newsom triumvirate, and nearly all of the large congressional delegation is likely to take a look at running. If Orange County Democrat Loretta Sanchez is the only Latino in the race, she could potentially have up to 25 percent of the vote in her corner, according to political analysts, a good head start in a multi-candidate field.\n\nThe open process could also provide an opening for Republicans in deeply blue California, as it has in a couple of Democratic-leaning congressional districts in 2012 and 2014.\n\nBut if Democrats are faced with the reality of a glut of qualified candidates, Republicans are assembling more of a fantasy team.\n\nRepublicans there said that their dream candidate would be former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, currently a professor at Stanford. Rice however has shown no real interest in politics.\n\nFormer Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina lost badly to Boxer in 2010, and has been laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cI am sure they are all meeting with their pollsters, their consultants, and preparing for this as if it were a presidential race, which is what the scope of it almost will be,\u201d said John Shallman, a Democratic consultant. \u201cThis is going to be the Game of Thrones of U.S. Senate races.\u201d\n\nFormer U.S Treasury official Neel Kashkari was routed by Brown in 2014, but is 41, a good fundraiser and\u2014as the child of Kashmiri parents\u2014gives the party a new, diverse face for a party still struggling with an anti-immigrant reputation earned in the 1990s.\n\nFirebrand Congressman Darrell Issa could self-fund in part, and would likely be the top vote-getter among Republicans, but is expected to struggle in a statewide race.\n\nBut so-called jungle primaries are notoriously hard to predict or poll. Harris is a half-black, half-Asian former district attorney of San Francisco, and if a number of other Northern Californians get into the race, it could create an opening for a Southern Californian or someone who is able to consolidate different pieces of the puzzle. And if two Democrats make it out of the primary, it would mean that the way to win a general election would mean grabbing a large portion of the Republican vote.\n\nAlthough most would-be contenders refused to show their hand in the hours after Boxer\u2019s announcement, many were said to be huddling with advisers to figure out the next move in what could be one of the most expensive and bloodiest Senate campaigns any state has ever seen.\n\n\u201cI am sure they are all meeting with their pollsters, their consultants, and preparing for this as if it were a presidential race, which is what the scope of it almost will be,\u201d said John Shallman, a Democratic consultant. \u201cThis is going to be the Game of Thrones of U.S. Senate races.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:38.919+0000"}

That\u2019s because the 2015-17 version of the world\u2019s most deliberative body risks being balkanized along lines that go far beyond party loyalty.\n\nAccording to Senate aides and insiders, the incoming Democratic caucus will be far more liberal and aggressive than the current version. It will likely be purged of many of the red-state Democrats who won election or reelection in the Democratic wave election year of 2006 and who helped curb some of the party\u2019s more progressive instincts on environmental legislation, gun measures, and financial regulation. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia, even tried to come to the aide of fellow red-state Democrat Mary Landrieu, who is facing a tough reelection challenge in Louisiana, by telling supporters that should she lose and Democrats retain control, Maria Cantwell, a noted environmentalist from Washington, would replace Landrieu as chairwoman of the Energy Committee.\n\n\u201cDepending on what happens next year, the handful of Democratic moderates left are going to be in a real struggle to have their voices heard in the caucus,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former longtime aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nFew progressives look forward to the prospect of a smaller Democratic caucus, especially one that loses the majority. But if there is a silver lining for activists, it will be that the candidates likely to win this November are those who have adopted a muscular, Elizabeth Warren-inspired approach; those who clung to muddled centrism will likely have lost.\n\n\u201cThis year could show the Democratic Party that progressive populism is where the country is right now,\u201d said T.J. Helmstetter, a spokesman for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has worked to fortify the campaigns of those lawmakers who represent what it calls \u201cthe Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is going to be the lesson coming out of these elections: that this message doesn\u2019t just work for America, it works for the Democratic Party,\u201d Helmstetter said.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who ask themselves, \u2018Why am I here if nothing gets done?\u2019\u201d\n\nOn the GOP side, over the last four years rank-and-file Republicans have been at turns frustrated and energized by a small, Tea Party-infused rebellion in their ranks. But the Rand Paul-Ted Cruz-Mike Lee contingent\u2014the \u201cwacko-birds,\u201d as John McCain sneeringly called them\u2014is likely to grow, as a number of soon-to-be arriving senators say they count the trio as legislative models. There is Rep. Tom Cotton, who is slightly favored to take the Arkansas seat held by Mark Pryor and whom Politico dubbed the leader of Congress\u2019s \u201cHell No Caucus\u201d hours after he was sworn in. There is Jodi Ernst, who has a better than even chance of winning the Senate seat in Iowa and has called federal minimum wage laws \u201cridiculous\u201d and suggested that President Obama should be impeached. And then there is Ben Sasse, an all but certain winner in Nebraska who has grassroots conservatives most excited and who has already been dubbed by Slate \u201cthe next Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nBut if the Cruz-Paul-Lee coalition grows, so too will a countervailing force inside the GOP caucus: the sitting Republican senators who have faced a Tea Party challenger and emerged victorious. So far, it is a small group, including just McCain, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Orrin Hatch of Utah. But the three have been some of the most vocal critics of the direction their Tea Party-backed colleagues want to take the party. And come January, they could be joined by 11 other Republicans who this year beat back challenges on their right flank, including Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and his No. 2, Minority Whip John Cornyn.\n\n\u201cI think you are going to see a lot less energy on the Ted Cruz-Rand Paul side of things, especially if we get the majority,\u201d said one senior Republican aide. \u201cWe are going to need to govern, and everybody knows that. McConnell will get to be the true leader again.\u201d\n\nThe multi-front battle on the GOP side is likely to grow even more heated as at least a half-dozen Republican senators use the Senate to launch their presidential campaigns. If the Cruzes and Pauls of the world had little reason to compromise before, now they will resist it completely as they seek to appeal to conservatives in Iowa and South Carolina. The more mainstream Republicans, meanwhile, senators like Rob Portman of Ohio and Florida\u2019s Marco Rubio, will decide whether to try to out-Tea Party their colleagues or make their play as moderate lawmakers who can build bridges across the party.\n\n\u201cI am looking for guys who can be bold, who can really step up,\u201d said Adam Brandon, executive vice president of FreedomWorks, the Koch brothers-affiliated group that helped foment the Tea Party revolution. \u201cLegislatively, we will be in a better position than we have been in a while.\u201d\n\nBrandon dismissed the notion that the members of the establishment GOP will become emboldened after defeating right-wing primary challenges.\n\n\u201cThe lesson of this year is that it is very hard to keep the chamber if you don\u2019t have grassroots conservatives behind you,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they really going to keep spending tons of money to keep these seats?\u201d\n\nIf an emboldened Democratic caucus and a GOP split between a loud and growing Tea Party wing and a vengeful establishment wing were not enough to make the U.S. Senate seem like the student government at Faber College, consider this: Next year\u2019s chamber also could feature the largest ever group of independents who proclaim allegiance to neither party.\n\nSen. Angus King, the independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats but has said he could flip Republican if they take over control, could be joined by Larry Pressler of South Dakota and Greg Orman of Kansas, both of whom lean left but whose loyalty could be up for grabs. If the three become the difference for either party between winning or losing control of the chamber, some Senate watchers fear they will switch between the two sides depending on who can offer the sweeter deal.\n\n\u201cAny one of them could theoretically change the conversation about what it takes to get something done in the Senate,\u201d said Evan Bayh, himself a two-term centrist Democrat from Indiana. \u201cBut you run the very real risk of being little more than an interesting gadfly.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, as Bayh and others pointed out, this is the U.S. Senate, a body where someone standing up and talking for a very long time is among the most exciting gestures possible and where 60 votes is still required to take any meaningful action.\n\n\u201cThe best hope [for getting something done] is the growing job dissatisfaction that many members feel,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who ask themselves, \u2018Why am I here if nothing gets done?\u2019 There is has to be something beyond ideological fights that go nowhere.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:39.212+0000"}
{"entityId": 1537, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Former NYPD Commissioner, and recent parolee, Bernie Kerik\u2019s memoir makes a bland case for criminal justice reform, and himself.\n\nTen years ago, Bernie Kerik was on top. The longtime NYPD officer had hitched his career to Rudy Giuliani and rode that wave all the way to NYPD Commissioner, then leveraged those contacts into lucrative security consulting contracts after 9/11 and nearly got appointed to a cabinet-level position in the Bush administration.\n\nThen, as fast as he ascended, Kerik came crashing down. He pled guilty in federal court in 2009 to eight charges of criminal conspiracy, tax fraud and lying under oath, and was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nNow Kerik is once again a free man, more or less, and has reinvented himself as a criminal justice reform advocate. He\u2019s hitting the speaking circuit and doing interviews, talking to anyone who will listen about how his time inside changed his views on the justice system. The latest salvo in his public comeback is his new memoir, From Jailer to Jailed: My Journey From Correction and Police Commissioner to Inmate #8488-054.\n\nThe summary on Amazon describes the book as a \u201chard-hitting, raw and oftentimes politically incorrect memoir.\u201d Given that Kerik used to have a no-bullshit tough-guy mustache, I dug into the book expecting maybe some good police stories, political ratfuckery and prison exploits.\n\nInstead Kerik has done something quite impressive: He has written a dull jailhouse memoir. Readers familiar with the format will immediately recognize the turgid style of the celebrity autobiography, specifically the \u201csetting the record straight\u201d sub-genre. See also: Mayor for Life: The Incredible Story of Marion Barry, Jr. and Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story by Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nIt is a slog to read\u2014first-person prose filtered through a PR professional and then chopped and rearranged into short, serviceable sentences by an aggressive editor. The end result is sort of like the goop they make chicken nuggets out of.\n\nFor example, here\u2019s a passage where Kerik responds to a fellow inmate who doesn\u2019t like paying taxes:\n\n\u201cBut the bottom line is you gotta pay taxes,\u201d I told him. If you don\u2019t, you come here.\u201d Ironic, coming from a guy serving time for tax fraud. But I believe it. I believe in paying taxes.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, Bernie Kerik believes in paying taxes, and he also believes in some loose definition of irony. In fact, he frequently reminds readers that his situation is odd because, you see, he used to be a cop, but then he got thrown in prison.\n\n\u201cHow could I do my time in Cumberland without thinking back to when I ran New York City\u2019s Department of Correction in the 1990s?\u201d Kerik ponders. \u201cThe parallels were obvious and dripping with irony\u2014for me a cold irony. The jailer now jailed. The commissioner now an inmate.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the book is delivered with the same amount of subtlety. As for \u201chard-hitting\u201d and \u201cpolitically incorrect,\u201d Kerik throws around the word \u201cfuck\u201d a few times, and he complains about the \u201cbullshitting\u201d in Washington, D.C., so it might be a touch edgy for your church book club.\n\nSo the writing is a mess, and no one gets thrown under the bus, but what about the book\u2019s criminal justice reform stance? Nothing Kerik says is wrong or wildly out of line with most other reform advocates, although he does wait until three-quarters of the way through the book to say he doesn\u2019t believe in drug decriminalization. But it is hard to separate the message from the messenger. As Kerik notes: \u201cI understand there is a public perception that I am corrupt. Certainly my convictions feed that perception.\u201d\n\nCertainly. Kerik also served as a police and prison official for 30 years, but it took a stint in a minimum-security prison camp for him to realize that most of the inmates around him were good, honest men\u2014just like him!\u2014who happened to get railroaded by the criminal justice system.\n\nIn fact, the only memorable line in the whole book is delivered by one of Kerik\u2019s fellow inmates: \u201cPrison is like dying with your eyes open.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Kerik\u2019s Road to Damascus moment was going down for four years on a bunch of white-collar charges. It also doesn\u2019t help that Kerik was housed in the same prison camp as Jack Abramoff, and the two got chummy during their sentences. Incredulous readers will have a hard time stomaching a scene where Kerik is commiserating with Abramoff about the injustice of the justice system\u2014Kerik has just been rejected for a job in the prison chapel and been given kitchen duty instead, not exactly a Cool Hand Luke chain gang\u2014and Abramoff responds like a sage and hardened con: \u201cThey do it because they can.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrison doesn\u2019t need to be like this,\u201d Kerik reflects. It is deep stuff. (Coincidentally, Abramoff also had his come-to-Jesus moment and is now a campaign finance reform advocate.)\n\nTo his credit, Kerik is self-aware enough to realize that his situation, especially his ability to drop millions of dollars on defense attorneys, is atypical. \u201cThe sad thing is if I can\u2019t survive a fight for justice, how can someone less privileged get any sort of justice?\u201d he asks.\n\nThe evidence of just how broken our criminal justice system is surrounds Kerik while he is in prison. He comes across inmates like a mentally ill man with a 3rd grade reading level who signed a plea deal he didn\u2019t understand, or a guy doing 10 years for a trumped up drug conspiracy charge and possession of one gram of cocaine. These are the most affecting moments in Kerik\u2019s memoir. In fact, the only memorable line in the whole book is delivered by one of Kerik\u2019s fellow inmates: \u201cPrison is like dying with your eyes open.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the other inmates are only given a few paragraphs a piece. Kerik never develops any real narrative of his time in prison. The one moment where Kerik\u2019s experience rises above his writing\u2014a disturbing account of his time in solitary confinement\u2014is an outlier. More than half of the rest of the book is padded out with novella-length descriptions of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. There\u2019s a whole chapter on Kerik\u2019s tenure in charge of Rikers Island and his self-described \u201chistoric turnaround\u201d of the facilities. There are long detours describing his consulting work for the king of Jordan and his time in Iraq. And finally, several chapters on his trial, conviction and sentencing, which he paints as an overzealous, politically motivated prosecution. The charges, Kerik assures, were all bunk.\n\nKerik\u2019s revelations about the criminal justice system\u2014that federal sentencing guidelines are draconian, that they are used by prosecutors to bully defendants into plea deals, that they destroy families and communities, especially communities of color, that the prison system leaves inmates ill-equipped to reenter society and often worse than before they entered the system, that the criminal justice system is used far too often as an alternative to mental health treatment, that the criminal justice system is out of line with our national ideals and founding documents\u2014are nothing new, and he doesn\u2019t add much fresh information or perspective to the debate.\n\nThe criminal justice reform movement is currently experiencing an unprecedented moment of bipartisan support, and as a result everyone is wary of taking unnecessary potshots, allies being a rare and precious commodity, but Kerik\u2019s book is full of cheap platitudes, pat conclusions and bad writing. As a criminal justice reform polemic, it is a retread. As a tell-all prison memoir, it is a snooze. And as a public image fluffer, it is a bit embarrassing and heavy-handed.\n\nThere is also the sneaking feeling, when seeing Kerik hitting the speech circuit, of unseemliness, of the disgraced ex-public official trying to slither back into public life. The New York Post reported earlier this year that Kerik\u2019s lawyer is petitioning a judge to let Kerik off supervised release, complaining that Kerik has been unable to get several lucrative consulting gigs.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, Mr. Kerik has had discussions with local government representatives as well as a national head-hunter for a Fortune 500 company concerning possible consulting opportunities,\u201d his lawyer wrote.\n\nAll of this makes it easy to be uncharitable and prejudiced against Kerik, but he does appear sincere and well-read on the subject. (He namedrops Michelle Alexander\u2019s essential The New Jim Crow and several other criminal justice books.) And if one believes that felons deserve a fair shake after their release, rather than the current system that leaves them unemployable and disenfranchised, then that includes Kerik, too. Even shitheels deserve equal justice under the law.\n\nAnyway, our criminal justice system is supposed to be based on the idea that once you serve your time, you have paid your debt to society. Kerik should be able to vote, hold public office, own a gun, and be able to take whatever Fortune 500 consulting gigs he can get. And he should certainly be able to travel freely and talk to current inmates about prison reform. I hope Kerik takes his reform spiel as far and wide as he can. I hope thousands of dudes in Jeter jerseys buy his book at LaGuardia Airport. And I hope he never picks up a pen again.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:39.505+0000"}

Those attacks occurred in Clinton\u2019s first year as a United States senator from New York, just as she was emerging as a political figure in her own right. She spent the next six years working to pass a bill that would eventually become the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which provided $4.2 billion for first responders to the attacks suffering from the effects of toxic dust.\n\nThe law is set to expire in 2016, just as Clinton is likely to be in the heat of a presidential campaign\u2014a date advocates for the bill pushed for, hoping that it would mean more attention to their cause.\n\nHer appearance at UFT headquarters, according to John Feal, a demolition supervisor at ground zero who had his foot amputated when a piece of steel fell on him during the cleanup and who led the effort to get federal benefits to the workers there, is a sign that Clinton, \u201cowns this now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going to hold her to what she says here tonight,\u201d he said.\n\nMostly, though, Clinton praised the forces of organized labor that pushed for the bill\u2014and which would likely motor any potential presidential campaign she may mount.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely imperative to recognize the key role that organized labor played in the very beginning. It was your members, your lost janitors and security guards and workers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was organized labor that came to the forefront.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrganized labor was my principal ally,\u201d Clinton added.\n\nAnd labor, or New York labor at least, signaled that it would be ready for Clinton, too, should she decide to mount another presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cIn Mrs. Clinton, we have someone who will stand with us and will fight with us,\u201d said Mario Cilento, president of the New York chapter of the AFL-CIO.\n\nClinton recognized several of her former constituents among the couple of hundred people in the audience and said that as a globe-trotting secretary of state she longed to return to New York.\n\nOn the nearly million miles worth of plane rides she took in those four years, she said she would occasionally shut her eyes \u201cand dream about being home.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s speech was marred at its conclusion by a handful of protesters who disrupted the proceedings to call attention to President Obama\u2019s policy on deportations of illegal immigrants.\n\nSeveral of the well-wishers were recognized with a \u201cGreat to see you again!\u201d from the former senator, and they responded meekly with a \u201cGreat to see you, as well.\u201d\n\nShouting, \u201cUnafraid! Undocumented\u201d they were quickly shuffled out. Out in the lobby, one of the protesters explained that they staged the demonstration to ask the former secretary, \u201cIs she going to continue the policy of Obama and continue to deport our families? Our communities cannot wait any longer.\u201d\n\nClinton, meanwhile, spent several minutes greeting audience members along the rope line and posing for cellphone selfies. (\u201cThis is going to be on Instagram in 30 seconds,\u201d said one young woman after securing her cheek-to-cheek shot alongside the possible next president of the United States.)\n\nSeveral of the well-wishers were recognized with a \u201cGreat to see you again!\u201d from the former senator, and they responded meekly with a \u201cGreat to see you, as well.\u201d\n\nClinton was asked about the protesters, who at least waited until she was finished speaking to make their case.

{"entityId": 1539, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Were Obama\u2019s 95-5 margins an aberration because of his race? So everyone says. But maybe 95-5 (or something close) is the new normal.\n\nHere\u2019s one story I predict you\u2019re going to read (should you choose to) about 367 times over the next 17 months: that Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t going to do as well or maybe even nearly as well among African-American voters, because, well, it\u2019s obvious. Black people, we\u2019ll be told, won\u2019t be enthusiastic about turning out to vote for her, because what\u2019s she ever done for them. And of course some portion of those 367 stories will feature breathless speculation that the Republican, whoever it is, just might surprise us among black voters, because remember what George W. Bush did in 2004, and the younger generation of African Americans don\u2019t feel the old loyalty to the Democrats their parents did, and, and, and, you can write the rest yourself.\n\nIt will be a key element in the \u201cHillary\u2019s in Trouble\u201d meme that\u2019s going to dominate the coverage of her campaign in the mainstream media. But is there any truth to it?\n\nYes, a little. Clinton and John Podesta and her other strategists are acknowledging as much with the big speech she gave yesterday in Texas laying the lumber into Republicans about voting rights and recent GOP voter-suppression schemes. This was her first capital-P Political speech of the campaign, and that she chose to make that speech about this topic and not a broader economic one, or one aimed squarely at women, say, demonstrates clearly enough that Clinton is concerned about getting out the black vote.\n\nIt was also a partisan speech, of the sort she doesn\u2019t usually give and most presidential candidates don\u2019t typically deliver this early in the process. If it\u2019s true that partisanship turns off centrist voters, and it is to some extent, then the Clinton camp obviously made the calculation that with respect to this issue and the larger goal of black turnout, alienating some white independent voters is a price worth paying.\n\nBut how much worrying does Clinton really need to do here? The standard media line, as suggested above, will be that Obama skewed things by being black and all, and that if you go back to 2004 and recall that George W. Bush got 16 percent of the black vote in Ohio, that was somehow a more \u201cnormal\u201d state of affairs, because there were two white candidates.\n\nSo, let\u2019s look at the numbers. Yes, Obama did skew things. He won the black vote 95-4 in 2008 and 93-6 in 2012. By contrast, John Kerry won the black vote 88-11. If you go back to 1964, that\u2019s exactly what the Democratic nominee averages, 88 percent. The Republican averages 10 percent.\n\nAside from head-to-head numbers, there\u2019s the matter of turnout. Obama also inspired blacks to vote in larger numbers, of course, so they made up 13 percent of the overall electorate in 2008 and 2012, as opposed to 11 percent in 2004. The increase in Ohio was particularly striking. In 2004, blacks constituted 10 percent of the total Ohio vote. In 2012, they were 15 percent.\n\nWhen Gerald Ford was getting 15 percent of the black vote in 1976, his party wasn\u2019t carrying out a jihad to make sure as few black people could vote as possible or uncorking champagne when the Supreme Court struck down the Voting Rights Act.\n\nBut here\u2019s the question. Are the Obama-era numbers an aberration, or are they more like a new normal? The near-universal assumption among journalists is aberration. But here\u2019s the case for why they might be something closer to the new normal, which rests on two points.\n\nThe first is the much-discussed demographic change. The white vote over the last three presidential elections has gone from 77 percent (2004) to 74 percent (2008) to 72 percent (2012). If the Obama era was an aberration, you\u2019d expect that figure to bounce back up. But electoral demographers say quite the opposite. One comprehensive statistical model predicts that the white vote will just keep dropping, down maybe to 70 percent in 2016. The African-American vote is expected to at least hold steady at 13.\n\nBut second and more important, it\u2019s about the Republican Party of then versus now. When Gerald Ford was getting 15 percent of the black vote in 1976, his party wasn\u2019t carrying out a jihad to make sure as few black people could vote as possible or uncorking champagne when the Supreme Court struck down the Voting Rights Act. Or, for that matter, trying to make sure as few working poor people as possible could have access to health insurance.\n\nWhen I was young I thought Ronald Reagan\u2019s Republican Party was bad on race, and it was, but the GOP is a far more openly and aggressively anti-black-people party today. Back then, there were still a fair number of moderate Republicans in the House and Senate who voted for civil rights measures. Arguably the greatest legal crusader against segregation of the 1960s and 1970s was a Republican, the venerable John Doar. Heck, Republicans in Congress even reauthorized the VRA when Dubya was president! Those days are long, long gone. Maybe not forever, but certainly for the foreseeable future.\n\nClinton will have to work it. And she is\u2014a proposal for automatic voter registration for every citizen who turns 18 (unless that citizen decides to opt out), which she called for in the speech, is great stuff. But her competition\u2014unless they nominate Rand Paul, which seems increasingly unlikely\u2014is making it easier for her. She probably won\u2019t duplicate Obama\u2019s numbers, but if someone wants to bet you that her black-vote totals will be closer to John Kerry\u2019s than to Obama\u2019s, that\u2019s a bet I\u2019d advise you to take in heartbeat.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:40.256+0000"}

And he might talk his way out of the presidency.\n\nThere\u2019s a funny thing about the former Republican presidential frontrunner: The governor has a curious verbal tic\u2014well known among some Walker watchers but largely ignored by everyone else\u2014where, well, he says yes to everything.\n\nAsk him a question at a press conference or in a gaggle, and he\u2019ll bob his head up and down while saying something like \u201cYeah\u201d or \u201cYeah, absolutely.\u201d He says that the way other people might say \u201cUm,\u201d or \u201cListen,\u201d or \u201cHmm.\u201d It\u2019s a filler word.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Not everyone knows that.\n\nAnd it seems to be quietly draining the blood from his campaign.\n\nYou may have noticed this two weeks ago, when the governor struggled mightily to answer a simple question about birthright citizenship. That whole debacle unspooled because MSNBC\u2019s Kasie Hunt\u2014in a crowded press gaggle at the Iowa State Fair\u2014asked Walker if he thought birthright citizenship should be eliminated.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he replied. \u201cTo me it\u2019s about enforcing the laws in this country. And I\u2019ve been very clear, I think you enforce the laws, and I think it\u2019s important to send a message that we\u2019re going to enforce the laws, no matter how people come here we\u2019re going to enforce the laws in this country.\u201d\n\nIf you parse that answer, Walker never really says he thinks that the kids of undocumented immigrants who are born here shouldn\u2019t have citizenship rights.\n\nKnock off the \u201cyeah,\u201d and it\u2019s a typical non-answer like the ones other presidential candidates give every day. His campaign tried to explain that he didn\u2019t mean \u201cyeah\u201d when he said \u201cyeah,\u201d but with minimal success. And the candidate ended up having to pick up the pieces on ABC\u2019s This Week, going on defense after days of mockery and explaining that he didn\u2019t back a constitutional amendment regarding the issue.\n\nIt should have been a marquee week for the governor. He was the first competitive Republican candidate to roll out a health-care reform plan, after all, and his back-and-forth with a heckler was one of the most memorable events of the Iowa State Fair. But instead of taking a victory lap, he had to spend the week herp-a-derping about the minutiae of citizenship law. Take away that one errant \u201cYeah,\u201d and things could have been very different.\n\nNow, this certainly isn\u2019t Walker\u2019s only problem; he struggled to distinguish himself at the Republican debate, and his vacillation on the immigration issue has won him skepticism from all corners. But still, some of his worst moments on the campaign trail can be traced to this one little tic.\n\nCharlie Sykes, a prominent conservative talk radio host in Wisconsin, made this case shortly after Walker\u2019s argle-bargling.\n\n\u201c[P]art of this may be due to Walker\u2019s unfortunate verbal tick where he answers questions with what appears to be an affirmative before giving his intended answer,\u201d Sykes wrote on Right Wisconsin. \u201cIf a reporter approached him at the Paducah County Fair and asked Walker if he supported a federal plan to beat baby whales to death with the bodies of baby whales, Walker might reply, \u2018Yeah\u2026. But what we should focus on is returning power to the states and the \u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nSykes should know. He\u2019s one of the single most powerful conservative voices in the Badger State, and estimates he\u2019s interviewed Walker hundreds of times since his early days in the State Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe joke about it all the time,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a parlor game: What did you get him to say yes to, initially? Anything!\u201d\n\nIn one case, the governor\u2019s overeager affirmation turned into an attack ad. In the lead-up to his 2014 reelection bid, the state\u2019s Democratic party put up a web video that showed the governor nodding yes as a reporter asked him if he was at the center of a criminal scheme.\n\n\u201c[P]art of this may be due to Walker\u2019s unfortunate verbal tic where he answers questions with what appears to be an affirmative before giving his intended answer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAbruptly, the audio goes out, the video goes to slow motion, and Walker nods his head up and down with eyes closed and sort of a grim look on his face,\u201d summarized PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\nPolitiFact proceeded to give Democrats a \u201cPants On Fire\u201d rating for the video, given that shortly after nodding \u201cyes,\u201d Walker told the reporter that, in fact, he was not a crook. But damage was still done.\n\nJessie Opoien, a reporter at the Cap Times in Madison who has covered Walker for a few years, said she\u2019s noticed the same thing.\n\n\u201cIf you watch him in a gaggle, he has this head thing down where he makes eye contact with everyone he\u2019s talking to a couple times, like his head is on a swivel,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if he\u2019s answering you directly, there\u2019s probably going to be a nod in there, like \u2018I\u2019m acknowledging you,\u2019 and it might look like \u2018I\u2019m saying yes.\u2019\u201d\n\nWisconsin reporters have learned to disregard the early nods, \u201cabsolutely\u2019s,\u201d \u201cyeah\u2019s,\u201d she added. They don\u2019t cover those monosyllables the way mainstream reporters covered Walker\u2019s answer to Hunt at the fair.\n\n\u201cIf we did that here, we would be dicks for parsing every single word that he says, because we know what he means,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s not the fault of national reporters to not know.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s latest verbal struggle\u2014when he suggested we should build a wall along the Northern border to keep out dangerous Canadian immigrants\u2014is a variant of this tic. On Meet the Press on Sunday, host Chuck Todd asked the governor if he thought we needed such a wall.\n\n\u201cSome people have asked us about that in New Hampshire,\u201d Walker replied. \u201cThey raised some very legitimate concerns, including some law enforcement folks that brought that up to me at one of our town hall meetings about a week and a half ago. So that is a legitimate issue for us to look at.\u201d\n\nOpoien chalks this up as another example of Walker\u2019s over-eagerness to answer things in the affirmative.\n\n\u201cHim saying something\u2019s worth looking at or worth considering is a really common answer he\u2019s given on things like Right to Work or the 20-week abortion ban,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to get nailed down on it, and he\u2019ll say it\u2019s worth looking at or worth considering or that\u2019s something we\u2019ll look at in the future.\u201d\n\nWalker isn\u2019t the only Wisconsin Republican with this problem. During the 2010 midterm elections, then-candidate Ron Johnson got asked if he would support opening the Great Lakes to oil drilling.\n\n\u201cYeah, you know, the bottom line is that, uh, we are an oil-based economy,\u201d he replied.\n\nChristian Schneider, a columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, explained that the \u201cYeah\u201d there was the same type of \u201cYeah\u201d Walker often says. But Johnson\u2019s comment\u2014understandably!\u2014became a Democratic attack ad.\n\n\u201c[S]imply beginning his answer with the word \u201cyeah\u201d ended up costing Johnson hundreds of thousands of dollars,\u201d wrote Schneider. \u201cRonJon had to write check after check to respond to Feingold\u2019s ad based on his reflexive response.\u201d\n\nWalker doesn\u2019t really have a good explanation for his \u201cyeah\u201d problem; \u201cWhen I say yeah, I mean um\u201d isn\u2019t exactly great TV ad content.

With the past two winners of the Iowa caucuses, Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee, both making moves toward a campaign and other social conservatives, ranging from Ben Carson to Ted Cruz, thinking about running, things are already looking crowded.\n\nOn Wednesday, Santorum told Real Clear Politics that he is approaching the 2016 election \u201cas if I\u2019m running.\u201d Santorum, who won the Iowa caucuses and finished second in 2012 GOP primary, has never made a secret of the fact that he\u2019s considering another bid for the nomination. The former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania has stumped across the country this year for Republican candidates, including a significant number of visits to Iowa. He has also gone out of his way to endorse candidates in competitive primaries who backed him in 2012, most notably Iowa Secretary of State Matt Schultz in a congressional primary and Prof. Sam Clovis in the Hawkeye State\u2019s Senate primary.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Huckabee is organizing a trip to Europe with a number of pastors from early primary states after Election Day. The trip, first reported in June by David Brody at CBN, will focus on the leadership of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and Pope John Paul II and feature stops in London, Krakow, and Los Angeles. Longtime Huckabee aide Hogan Gidley described the trip to The Daily Beast as \u201can outstanding political move\u201d that allows the former Arkansas governor to display his \u201cunderstanding of the world around us.\u201d\n\nGidley also said that delegations of business leaders and pastors have been traveling to see the Fox News host to urge him to run for president. While Huckabee pondered running in 2012 before deciding not to mount a bid, Gidley said that this time the former governor was expressing \u201ca much different tenor and tone\u201d in contemplating a run.\n\nBoth Huckabee and Santorum had considerable overlap in their support during their respective presidential bids. They were both scrappy and underfunded social conservative standard-bearers who pulled off underdog wins in Iowa against Mitt Romney. But if both run, they may have to compete over the same pool of voters\u2014and there will be plenty of candidates appealing to Iowa conservatives.\n\nIn fact, according to the most recent poll of Iowa caucusgoers, the favorite potential candidate from the conservative wing of the Republican Party is neither Huckabee nor Santorum; it\u2019s Ben Carson..\n\nBen Carson\u2019s presence in the race would serve as yet another draw to the type of voters who both Santorum and Huckabee will have to woo.\n\nCarson is looking to be a somewhat formidable candidate. His super PAC raised $3.3 million in the most recent fundraising period (although it only netted $100,000 after accounting for expenses, most of which were for fundraising). It\u2019s likely that Carson, who would be a first-time candidate whose own top adviser acknowledges that he suffers from \u201cfoot-in-mouth disease,\u201d will flame out before the first ballots are cast. But his presence in the race would serve as yet another draw to the type of voters who both Santorum and Huckabee will have to woo.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Ben Carson who might be their competition.\n\nThere\u2019s a baker\u2019s dozen of candidates who could compete for conservative voters, from national figures like Cruz and Scott Walker to somewhat obscure governors like Bobby Jindal and Mike Pence, all of whom would have the potential to catch fire and who will be competing over many of the same voters and activists.\n\nThe question though is how this sorts itself out. Many conservatives still feel traumatized from the divisive primaries in 2008 and 2012, where candidates on the right of the party battled for position while two establishment candidates, John McCain and Mitt Romney, slipped by to win the nomination... and then lose the general election to Barack Obama.\n\nThis time around, there will be a strong centripetal force among social conservatives to settle on one candidate to challenge whoever eventually emerges as the establishment choice, be it Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, or someone else, not to mention Rand Paul, who has appeal among both social conservatives and some establishment Republicans without belonging to either faction. But that sorting process still has a while to sort itself out as candidates test the waters and see if they can mount and maintain viable candidacies.

Jeb Bush announced in mid-December that he would \u201cactively explore\u201d running for the Republican presidential nomination, curious parties took to Google to learn more about him. While they were there, many of them were greeted by another politician\u2019s name at the bottom of the page\u2014one they hadn\u2019t searched for.\n\n\u201cJoin a movement working to shrink government. Not grow it,\u201d read one of the ads, placed by RandPAC, the political action committee supporting Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is himself expected to run for the nomination. Another read: \u201cWe need leaders who will stand against Common Core.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later, when former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee announced that he would leave his talk show at Fox News to ponder a presidential bid, the phenomenon occurred again: \u201cLess Taxes Not More\u2026 We Need Leaders Who Will Cut Taxes Not Raise Them. Join Us!\u201d\n\nFor Team Paul, this passive-aggressive trolling campaign is the equivalent of lurking in the back of the room during your opponent\u2019s debate prep and pelting them with spitballs.\n\nThe ads have a dual purpose. First, they allow Paul to siphon off attention from whichever potential candidate is making news. Second, they allow his campaign to underscore the weaknesses of other candidates by highlighting Paul\u2019s strengths.\n\nWith a verbal wink, Paul\u2019s senior adviser Doug Stafford said they had chosen this method of pre-campaign campaigning \u201cmostly because we like to amuse ourselves.\u201d\n\nBut he added that the tactic ensured all \u201crelevant\u201d topics in the world of politics were back to the world of Paul.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of our way of inserting Rand in what people are talking about,\u201d he said.\n\nPut simply, it\u2019s a way for Paul to be part of a conversation without contributing anything other than his presence.\n\n\n\nBut the ads are not just intended to remind the Google-curious that Paul exists and is thinking about running for president. They are also a clever, cost-effective (Google only requires you to pay for ads that have been clicked on) way of introducing the would-be Bush or Huckabee fans to Paul.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of our way of inserting Rand in what people are talking about,\u201d said Doug Stafford, Paul\u2019s senior adviser.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say 100 people search \u2018Jeb Bush,\u2019 and 20 or 30 of them click on Rand instead,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cWe want people to click on it.\u201d\n\nUnlike with old-school mailers, campaigns can be sure of exactly how many targeted digital ads people see and how effective they are in getting donations. They also target the right people: If someone is already Googling Bush or Huckabee, there is a good chance they care about the presidential election.\n\n\u201cIf someone takes a couple of seconds out of their day to type a candidate\u2019s name into Google or any other search engine, it\u2019s a pretty big step,\u201d one GOP strategist said. Campaigns that buy these types of ads, like Team Paul, the Republican added, are \u201ctrying to capture the intent of someone who is searching for something.\u201d\n\nThe ads are the work of Vincent Harris, Paul\u2019s superstar digital strategist, who coincidentally worked for Huckabee in Iowa for three months in 2007.\n\nAsked if Team Paul planned to purchase targeted ads for other 2016 contenders like Chris Christie and Rick Perry, Harris danced: \u201cThose names seem like people that it would certainly make sense to advertise on with targeted messages as the year progresses\u2026 The digital side of the PAC and Rand 2016 will always be engaging where the news is.\u201d\n\n\n\nAsked the same question, Stafford was coy: \u201cI mean, if we don\u2019t now, won\u2019t the other ones be offended?\u201d\n\nOffending the other ones has been a central strategy for Paul over the last year. He has picked pre-primary brawls with Christie, Perry, and Marco Rubio. But the comparatively passive-aggressive nature of the targeted ads provides insight into the psychology of Paul\u2019s campaign and, by extension, Paul himself. In spirit, he is the kid at the back of the class who believes he has all the answers, and he will sigh or yawn loudly when one of his dimmer peers has the floor.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:42.397+0000"}

For years now, Uber has successfully fended off such efforts, arguing, \u201cHey, we\u2019re just an app.\u201d We admire the innovative spirit that Uber represents and use the service ourselves often. But who are they trying to kid? Berwick wouldn\u2019t be out there driving on her own. She\u2019s an Uber employee.\n\nAmerica is filled with millions of Berwicks. Middle-class workers face many threats, including declining wages and the rising costs of education. But by far the biggest threat to middle-class workers\u2014and to our economy as a whole\u2014is the changing nature of employment itself.\n\nGone is the era of the lifetime career, having been replaced by a new economy intent on recasting full-time employees into contractors, vendors, and temporary workers. It is an economic transformation that promises new efficiencies and greater flexibility for \u201cemployers\u201d and \u201cemployees\u201d alike, but which threatens to undermine the very foundation upon which middle-class America was built and to strip away benefits.\n\nThat is why it is essential that we imagine and adopt new policies that guarantee all workers the basic level of economic security necessary to sustain and grow the American middle class, and with it, the economy as a whole. We must acknowledge the radically different needs of a new generation of Americans\u2014many of whom already have more employers in a week than their parents had in a lifetime\u2014by adopting a new \u201cShared Security System\u201d designed to fit the flexible employment relationships of the \u201csharing economy.\u201d\n\nTake, for example, an American worker whose story is increasingly typical of this new age. We\u2019ll call her \u201cZoe.\u201d Zoe is a woman in her late 20s who works part time at a hotel outside Denver. She\u2019s worked at the front desk for five years, and her supervisor says he\u2019s happy with her performance\u2014but he never schedules her for more than 29 hours in a single week, so she does not qualify for health insurance or other benefits that full-time workers enjoy. Always in need of extra income, she started auctioning her services as a landscaper on the popular work-outsourcing site TaskRabbit. She earns an additional $100 or so a week at it.\n\nBy far the biggest threat to middle-class workers\u2014and to our economy as a whole\u2014is the changing nature of employment itself.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday nights, she\u2019ll usually pick up a \u201cshift\u201d working as a driver for UberX. Occasionally, on the rare weekday off, she\u2019ll go live on UberX to drive people to and from the airport. During tourist season, Zoe will pick up a little spending money by renting out her apartment on Airbnb, living in her parents\u2019 house for days or weeks at a time.\n\nIf you think all her hard work amounts to a stable lifestyle, you\u2019re wrong. Zoe doesn\u2019t have enough money in the bank to sustain a savings account, let alone to contribute to retirement. She\u2019s never late with her rent, but the idea of owning a house is far out of reach.\n\nThe contrast between the experience of Zoe\u2019s generation and that of her parents is stark. Zoe\u2019s parents entered the workforce with the expectation that hard work would be rewarded with decent pay, improving prospects, and a comfortable retirement; it was an era in which most Americans could reasonably expect to work for only a handful of companies over the course of their career, and certainly no more than one employer at a time. This was the social contract of the 1950s, \u201960s, and \u201970s. But for Zoe\u2019s generation, this contract no longer exists.\n\nThe lesson we can take from Zoe\u2019s experience is that our traditional job-based benefit system no longer makes sense in an economy in which fewer and fewer workers will hold traditional jobs. For while the sharing economy promises many exciting new opportunities, without a new labor-owner framework, it simply cannot provide the economic benefits, stability, and security necessary for a robust and thriving middle class.\n\nAn economy based on micro-employment requires the accrual of micro-benefits, and a twenty-first-century sharing economy requires a twenty-first-century social contract that assures shared economic security and broad prosperity.\n\nWe propose a new Shared Security System that endows every American worker with, first, a \u201cShared Security Account\u201d in which to accrue the basic employment benefits necessary for a thriving middle class, and second, a new set of \u201cShared Security Standards\u201d that complement and reinforce that account.\n\nOne can think of the Shared Security Account as analogous to Social Security, but encompassing all of the employment benefits traditionally provided by a full-time salaried job. Shared Security benefits would be earned and accrued via automatic payroll deductions, regardless of the employment relationship, and, like Social Security, these benefits would be fully prorated, portable, and universal.\n\nProration. The obvious solution to the explosion of part-time work\u2014voluntary or otherwise\u2014is to prorate the accrual of benefits on an hourly or equivalent basis. For example, if Zoe works 30 hours a week at the hotel, she should earn three-quarters of the benefits offered by a full-time 40-hour-a-week job; if she works 20 hours a week, she should earn half the benefits.\n\nTo be clear, proration is not a radical idea. Social Security and Medicare have always been prorated: Zoe\u2019s employer pays half of her 15.3 percent combined Social Security and Medicare tax, regardless of how many hours she works. But all mandatory benefits that normally accrue to full-time employees on a daily basis\u2014sick days, vacation days, health insurance, unemployment insurance, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, retirement matching, Social Security, and Medicare\u2014should also accrue to part-time employees (hourly, salaried, or contract) and sharing-economy providers on a prorated hourly or equivalent basis.\n\nPortability. Job-based benefits no longer make sense in an economy where fewer and fewer workers hold traditional jobs. This is why these accrued benefits must be fully portable, following the worker from job to job, or contract to contract. For example, paid vacation days that Zoe accrues at one employer could be carried over to her next, although the cost of paying for these days would come from funds banked in her Shared Security Account. Because benefits from multiple employers are pooled into the same account, portability and proration work together to provide workers with the full panoply of benefits, even within the flexible micro-employment environment of the sharing economy.\n\nUniversality. In the new economy, a basic set of benefits and labor standards must be universal across all employers and all forms of employment, with few exceptions or exemptions. A robust set of mandatory universal benefits would put all employees and employers alike on an equal footing, while providing the economic security and certainty necessary for the middle class to thrive.\n\nWe need many additional worker-friendly changes, things we collectively call Shared Security Standards: paid leave, an overtime threshold covering the bottom 65 percent of workers, a $15 minimum wage indexed to living standards, pay equity, and fair scheduling, to name a few. Together, the Shared Security Account and the Shared Security Standards\u2014along with family support programs like affordable child care and high-quality universal preschool\u2014would comprise a new social contract designed to fit the flexible employment relationships of the new economy. This is how we will usher in a new era of middle-class economic security, and by so doing also provide American businesses with the economic stability and certainty that they demand.\n\nThis column is adapted from a longer essay in the Summer 2015 issue of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas.

{"entityId": 1544, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Providing fodder for endless attack ads, challengers to Democratic incumbents in three tough Senate races voted for a budget even more draconian than Paul Ryan\u2019s.\n\nPresident Obama is raising lots of money to help stave off Republican control of the Senate, but the only thing that can really save Democrats is a larger voter turnout than the typical midterm election attracts. This November\u2019s election will never approach presidential-year numbers, but if Democrats can add a percentage or two\u2014and in some deep red states, more than that\u2014victory could be within reach.\n\nTo boost turnout, Democrats have to make voters believe the stakes are high, and one of the best ways to do that, as history has shown, is persuading people that if Republicans are elected, they will scale back programs such as Social Security and Medicare. \u201cIt\u2019s an oldie but goody,\u201d says Larry Sabato, founder and director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, noting that Democrats won the Senate back in 1986 in large part on the strength of their promise to protect those programs. \u201cYou have to have some issue to excite the voters,\u201d he says. \u201cIf anything upsets the apple cart, this might.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are widely favored to pick up the six seats they need to gain the Senate majority, but race by race, it may not be the slam dunk the GOP anticipates. Sabato recently switched the Senate race in Arkansas from leaning Republican to toss-up based in part on incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor\u2019s attacks on his challenger, Rep. Tom Cotton, for his votes for the Ryan budget and a more draconian Republican Study Committee (RSC) budget for those who thought the Ryan budget didn\u2019t go far enough to cut spending.\n\n\u201cThe RSC budget is a travesty, and any Democrat who can use it should,\u201d says Matt Bennett, senior vice president for public affairs and a cofounder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic group whose support for entitlement reforms has taken flak from more traditional Democrats. On the study group budget, there is no divide.\n\nVoted on with little fanfare in March 2013, just before the Republican-controlled House passed the Ryan budget, the RSC budget is what MSNBC host Rachel Maddow called the Democrats\u2019 \u201csecret sauce\u201d in a recent segment that featured the Pryor-Cotton race. \u201cIt does all the same things [as the Ryan budget], but it does them sooner and does them worse,\u201d says Erik Dorey, Pryor\u2019s deputy campaign manager. While Ryan increases the retirement age to 67, RSC takes it to 70 and hastens the transformation of Medicare into a voucherized system. \u201cIt\u2019s a great vote to cite because it gives you some punch to TV ads,\u201d says Sabato. \u201cIt\u2019s not just rhetoric; it\u2019s an actual vote.\u201d\n\nThe RSC budget is particularly effective against Cotton, as he was the only member of the Arkansas congressional delegation to vote for it. He also was alone in his vote against the farm bill this year, which hurt him. \u201cCotton hasn\u2019t roared out of the gate the way people thought he would, and the Pryor name is golden there,\u201d says Sabato, adding that while the Democratic incumbent may not win in the end, the race is going to be much closer than anyone anticipated when Pryor was called \u201ctoast\u201d just a few months ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great vote to cite because it gives you some punch to TV ads,\u201d says Sabato. \u201cIt\u2019s not just rhetoric; it\u2019s an actual vote.\u201d\n\nThe RSC contains a litany of problematic items for Cotton, from drastically cutting Pell grants to eliminating subsidized air service for smaller communities, a market access program that helps rural states sell their products, and a number of regional conservation programs. These items may not end up in ads, but Pryor highlights them as he travels around Arkansas.\n\n\n\nThis summer, the Senate will vote on the Medicare Protection Act, introduced by Pryor to require a 60-vote majority to make changes in the program; budget issues normally require a simple majority. \u201cWe\u2019re on solid ground when this race is a choice between two very different records in Washington,\u201d says Dorey, who has watched Pryor pull ahead in recent polls.\n\nTwo other key Senate races in Louisiana and Colorado pit incumbent Democrats against House Republicans who voted for both the Ryan budget and the RSC. Louisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu\u2019s media adviser, Mark Mellman, calls the votes the gift that keeps on giving. When The New York Times asked Landrieu\u2019s challenger, Rep. Bill Cassidy, how those votes might affect the race, he dismissed them as \u201cmonkey dust.\u201d Maybe so, but tell that to the voters. Mellman plans to hit Republicans for their failure to expand health care, and without saying Medicaid, inform voters that their tax dollars are going to New York and California to help people there because Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal refuses to take the federal money.\n\nRaising the retirement age to 70 or moving Medicare to a voucher system are flash points that Democrats are exploiting after taking a beating in the last two election cycles for shifting money out of Medicare into Obamacare, savings that Republicans incorporated into their own budget plan while decrying President Obama and the Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s an old strategy bolstered by new evidence,\u201d says Jim Manley, former spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. \u201cThere are a lot of good 30-second ads contained in both these bills [Ryan budget and RSC].\u201d In Colorado, where incumbent Sen. Mark Udall is facing a spirited challenge from Rep. Cory Gardner, who voted for both budgets, the \u201csecret sauce\u201d is there to be used as needed.\n\nManley concedes that Democrats are backing themselves into a corner much the way Republicans have with their no-taxes pledge, \u201cbut given the fact that Republicans are not serious about legislating, that problem will have to be dealt with another time.\u201d For now, the secret sauce is about winning, not governing.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article called the Republican Study Committee the Republican Study Group.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:43.447+0000"}

He paid a lower tax rate the year before. And he paid a lower tax rate the year before.\n\nIs that bad?\n\nHere\u2019s Obama describing people like himself, multimillionaires who pay less than their secretaries:\n\n\u201cWhen Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it\u2019s not because they envy the rich. It\u2019s because they understand that when I get tax breaks I don\u2019t need and the country can\u2019t afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference\u2014like a senior on a fixed income; or a student trying to get through school; or a family trying to make ends meet. That\u2019s not right. Americans know it\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s puzzling that the president of the United States would choose to take a course of action that he has publicly denounced as \u201cnot right.\u201d\n\nIn 2013 the Obamas paid 20.4 percent in federal income taxes. In 2012, they paid 18.4 percent. In 2011, they paid 20.5 percent; that was on $789,674 and it was when the president was busy promoting the \u201cBuffett Rule\u201d of higher taxes, so that no secretary would ever pay more than his or her millionaire boss. The president\u2019s low tax rate prompted the White House to admit, begrudgingly, that it was \u201cslightly lower\u201d than that of his secretary, who made $95,000.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for politicians to frame an issue along moral grounds and then decline to live up to those standards in ways large and small. It happens every time a politician gets caught in a sex flap, like the Republican congressman recently caught kissing a staffer in his office. (This sex in the office tendency for politicians never seems to end well.) Rep. Andy Jacobs (D-IN), a decorated Korean War veteran, coined the phrase \u201cwar wimps\u201d to describe \u201csomeone who is all too willing to send others to war but never got \u2019round to going himself.\u201d\n\nObama isn\u2019t a tax cheat. He\u2019s paying what the law requires. The problem lies in the danger of describing those who obey the law as doing something they know is \u201cnot right.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a habit of Obama\u2019s to assume a moral superiority based on his words, not his actions.\n\nIt\u2019s a habit of Obama\u2019s to assume a moral superiority based on his words, not his actions. In 2008 he became the first major party nominee for president since Nixon not to accept public financing; he announced his decision in a video proclaiming his support for public financing. He denounces money from special interests and raises more money from Wall Street than any president in history. He praises press freedom, yet the lawyer for The New York Times during the Pentagon Papers concludes: \u201cPresident Obama will surely pass Richard Nixon as the worst president ever on issues of national security and press freedom.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s press secretary Jay Carney last week trying to explain why the president is pushing equal pay for women but on the White House staff, women make 88 percent of what men make:\n\nQ: But why is that the median salary of women in the White House is 88 percent of men then?\n\nMR. CARNEY: What I can tell you is that we have\u2014as an institution here\u2014have aggressively addressed this challenge. And obviously, though, at the 88 cents that you cite, that is not 100, but it is better than the national average.\n\nOK. But if Obama is CEO of the White House, why not set an example and say, \u201cGee, make it better than the national average\u201d?\n\nThe danger of making everything a moral fight and not living up to one\u2019s own standards is that pretty soon nothing becomes a moral fight. There\u2019s hardly anything more annoying than being lectured to \u201ceat your peas\u201d by someone happily seated at the dessert table. That may be one of the keys to why the latest CBS/NYT poll shows that the president has become far more unpopular than many of his policies. Obama has a 41 percent approval, while a policy like raising the minimum wage to $10.10 is favored by two-thirds of the public.\n\n\n\nInevitably, some will argue that this rise in the president\u2019s unfavorable rating is tied to race. It\u2019s an impossible argument on either side, but one can only note that this same president once had a 79 percent favorable rating.\n\nMoral authority is a key governing tool of a president and terribly difficult to replace once lost. As the Iraq War went badly and the Hurricane Katrina recovery turned disastrous, President Bush lost much of his once-powerful ability to rally a cause. Today the West is crying out for a leader to unite world opinion against Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression.

And while it\u2019s true that the GOP\u2019s future is about as healthy as cancer, there\u2019s similarly no reason to think we\u2019re entering an era of Democratic ascendancy.\n\nIf that sounds surprising, it\u2019s probably because it seemed that the one loud-and-clear message to come out of the 2012 presidential race was that the kids still loved Barack Obama and the Democratic Party for which he stands. In a contest between two equally unashamed wearers of mom jeans, Millennial voters between the ages of 18 and 29 picked Obama over everybody\u2019s least-favorite uncle, Mitt Romney, by a whopping 60 percent to 36 percent.\n\nSure, that was a smaller margin than in 2008, when Obama pulled an amazing 66 percent to John McCain\u2019s amazingly miserable 31 percent, but it still provided the cloud-like cushion by which the president easily won his second term. It\u2019s incredible, really: Romney handily won a majority of votes from the 30-and-over crowd, but Obama\u2019s ginormous landslide among Millennials was more than enough to give him a 5 million vote win and an easy-peasy 51 percent to 47 percent margin.\n\nPew Research has noted that the Democratic presidential candidate has easily carried the youth vote in each election since 2004 and underscored that Millennials \u201care far more likely than older voters to identify as Democrats than their older counterparts.\u201d John Kerry\u2014who mixed the charm of Frankenstein\u2019s monster with a similar inability to utter coherent sentences and thoughts\u2014beat Bush among the kids 54 percent to 47 percent.\n\nAfter the 2012 election, according to Pew, barely a quarter of Millennials self-identified as Republican.

Woe unto the politicians and parties that fail to grok this, as they will face only bigger and bigger losses in market share. As it stands, Gallup and others have already been charting the growth in unaffiliated voters for decades.\n\nTo be sure, there is virtually no good news for the GOP in the Reason-Rupe Poll. Just 22 percent of Millennials self-identify as Republican or lean that way while 43 percent of youth voters consider themselves Democrats or lean in that direction. A sizable 34 percent of Millennials are true independents (that is, they don\u2019t lean in either direction).\n\nBut forget about the seemingly massive Democratic advantage. After growing up under the Bush and Obama administrations, the Millennials are overwhelmingly skeptical of government\u2019s ability to do anything well.\n\nTwo-thirds agree that \u201cgovernment is usually inefficient and wasteful.\u201d In 2009, that number was just 42 percent. Across a range of 15 issues (including privacy, drug policy, taxes, spending, health care, and more), neither party wins a majority of Millennials. About six in 10 believe that government regulators are the tools of the special interests they are supposed to police and that federal agencies routinely abuse their power. A solid majority (55 percent) says businesses are paying their fair share of taxes.\n\nHowever, such crypto-libertarianism is countered by a very strong belief in the need for government to provide a safety net. Fully 70 percent say they believe in guaranteed housing, health care, and income for the country\u2019s poorest people. When taxes are not mentioned, 54 percent of Millennials say they want a \u201clarger government with more services\u201d and just 44 percent say they want a \u201csmaller government with fewer services\u201d (these figures are in line with results from Pew).\n\nThose percentages flip when Millennials are asked if they want a bigger government with more services even if it means paying higher taxes. In the latter case, 57 percent support smaller government and just 41 percent insist on bigger government\u2014a finding that is consistent across gender and economic groups. They\u2019re young, but they weren\u2019t born yesterday. Millennials have a keen awareness that Social Security and Medicare are living on borrowed time and borrowed money and that today\u2019s youth are unlikely to get anything out of such programs.\n\nIf there\u2019s a unifying thought among Millennials, it\u2019s that they want to be able to make decisions for themselves. Large, consistent majorities (even among self-identified Republicans) favor pot legalization and marriage equality and think that individuals should be allowed to eat trans fats, drink whatever size soda they want, gamble online, and smoke e-cigarettes in public places.\n\nWhatever else helicopter parenting might have wrought, it didn\u2019t kill interest in vice or belief in individual effort. About six in 10 believe that people can get ahead with hard work and that bad life choices are the main reason for weak performance in terms of economic success.\n\nFifty-five percent of Millennials say they want to open their own business some day. It\u2019s true that 42 percent of respondents said they prefer socialism to capitalism, but only 16 percent could actually define socialism in any meaningful way. Most Millennials have a positive view of business and commerce and two-thirds say they want an economy managed by the free market rather than by the government.\n\nIndeed, Millennials seem to be using familiar political terms in ways that are easy to misinterpret. Over 60 percent call themselves socially liberal while less than half dub themselves fiscally liberal. Yet Millennials told the Reason-Rupe folks not only that being in favor of gay marriage and legal pot were liberal positions, but that they made you liberal regardless of your economic views.\n\nIt might be tempting to write off 18-to-29-year-olds as callow, confused kids who just don\u2019t see the obvious through-lines of the centuries-old Democratic or Republican identities. To a dyed-in-the-wool partisan, it makes obvious sense that a voter who is anti-abortion will also be pro-gun and in favor of a constitutional amendment on flag burning and serious cuts in the corporate income tax rate.\n\nFor libertarians, conservatives, and progressives alike, the Millennials\u2019 lack of interest in our boldly systematic philosophical consistency speaks directly to the failure of public education. How dare these young voters not simply accept our conceits and arguments as their own! Who do they think are, writing their own script for who they are and what they believe? Don\u2019t they know how much time we\u2019ve spent on all this?\n\nThe simple fact is that the 21st century so far has been a total clusterfuck, especially for Millennials. Bush\u2019s pledge to pursue a humble foreign policy metastisized into two long, ineffective, and awful wars. After running as a small-government conservative, he increased federal spending by more than 50 percent in real terms and then closed out his time at the top with the laugh line, \u201cI\u2019ve abandoned free-market principles to save the free-market system.\u201d\n\nThen came Obama, handsome rider of unicorns and dreamer of hope and change. He immediately passed a stimulus package that failed every test it set for itself (amazingly, it didn\u2019t even spend money as quickly as it pledged!). Obamacare is still unpopular with the country at large and has only the slimmest approval among Millennials: the Reason-Rupe Poll finds 51 percent like it; that number goes down among younger people who are no longer on their parents\u2019 dime.\n\nAssumed to be the peace candidate, Obama tripled troop strength in Afghanistan and tried to keep American soldiers in Iraq forever, only leaving after the freely elected government there sent us packing. He raided a record number of medical marijuana dispensaries in California, still refuses to say he backs legalization, and has deported record number of immigrants.\n\nAfter saying that he was against gay marriage, he miraculously \u201cevolved\u201d on the issue when it looked like he might need the gay vote to best Mitt Romney, thus enacting one of the most strategically timed conversions since Constantine got religion on the banks of the Tiber.\n\nThen there\u2019s his whole stance on privacy. In the wake of ongoing Snowden revelations about government surveillance programs that would make George W. Bush blush, the former constitutional law professor is saying he\u2019s in favor of having a dialogue on privacy and all that jazz, but hey, he\u2019s got a really busy day job.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s Millennials who are confused, right?\n\nThis may be all the parties need to know if they really want to truly nail down the youth vote: According to the Reason-Rupe Poll, 53 percent of Millennial voters would support a candidate who is both socially liberal and fiscally conservative. If only the Dems or the Reps could cobble one or two together out back in the shed.\n\nAnd for smug Democratic partisans who note that in the last three elections, their guy pulled 54 percent, 66 percent, and 60 percent of the youth vote, think about this: What happens when the GOP runs a candidate in 2016 that is 10 or 15 more years younger than Hillary Clinton? Or a candidate who isn\u2019t openly hostile to gay marriage or legal pot?\n\nDemocrats are sniffing up the wrong pant leg if they think Millennials are firmly in the \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that\u201d coalition and will stand for unlimited spending and overreach by government. By the same token, if conservative Republicans are betting the future on gay-bashing, pot-hating, nativist candidates fond of bombing foreign countries, well, they\u2019re shit out of luck, too.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:44.282+0000"}

But when the 114th Congress gavels into session in January, GOP speechwriters are going to need some new material.\n\nThat\u2019s because many of fastest rising stars in the Republican Party, including Senators-elect Tom Cotton (Ark.), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Dan Sullivan (Ak.) and Rep.-elect Elise Stefanik, all graduated from Harvard. Along with Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.), Pat Toomey (Penn.), David Vitter (La.) and Mike Crapo (Wyo.), the Republican Harvard contingent will outnumber Harvard Democrats in the U.S. Senate for the first time in recent memory.\n\nTom Cotton credits Harvard as the place where he \u201cdiscovered political philosophy as a way of life.\u201d Elise Stefanik, who will be the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, was an editor and writer at the Harvard Crimson and served as the vice chair of Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics. Like Cotton and Stefanik, Sasse was a government major before going on to Oxford and Yale and becoming a college president himself.\n\nDespite its reputation as \u201cKremlin on the Charles,\u201d and the \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of Cambridge,\u201d current and former students at Harvard describe the campus as both overtly liberal in its politics and an ideal place for conservative thought to develop and thrive.\n\n\u201cI thought it was great place to be Republican,\u201d said Mark Isaacson, a former president of the Harvard Republican Club who is now a speechwriter for the RNC. \u201cA \u2018Harvard Democrat\u2019 is kind of redundant, but a Harvard Republican is always being challenged, so you\u2019ve got to self-evaluate a lot. You\u2019ve got to think about your views and why you hold them.\u201d\n\nAaron Hendricks, the current president of the Harvard Republicans, said he has seen the left-of-center political scene at Harvard make some students even more conservative than when they arrived.\n\n\u201cHarvard is a great place to get a vision of just how liberal people can be. So when you\u2019re told that your peers are the future leaders of America, for some conservatives, that\u2019s a really scary thought,\u201d Henricks said. \u201cI can definitely see how that could push people from being someone who thinks conservatively to someone who wants to step up and get involved.\u201d\n\nBeyond getting involved in campus politics, students pointed to a handful of professors whom conservatives credit for adding a heavily intellectual element to conservatism at Harvard, including Greg Mankiw, Marty Feldstein, Ruth Wisse and Peter Berkowitz.\n\nBut no professor is credited more or as often as Harvey Mansfield, the exceedingly polite, happily controversial conservative professor of political science who includes Tom Cotton, Ross Douthat, Andrew Sullivan and William Kristol among his well-known alumni.\n\nMansfield teaches the classics from Plato to Toqueville and offers a seminar on federalism that reads like the North Star for much of the conservative philosophy that runs through Republican speeches today.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t know why so many Harvard grads are succeeding in politics these days, but he does think conservatives at Harvard get a better education at the school than the more liberal students.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a conservative student here, you have to struggle a little and you have to be more skeptical than most people and you have to think in your mind how you would answer this kind of argument. You figure it out for yourself,\u201d Mansfield said. \u201cYou are more on the defense, but because you have learned how to play defense, you also get better at offense, so you get better at arguing.\u201d\n\nThe Harvard College Democrats remain the largest political club on campus with an email list of 2,000, weekly meetings, four standing committees and election-year events like sending 300 students to New Hampshire to campaign for President Obama in 2012.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz, by the way, is not a Harvard man. He\u2019s Princeton,\u201d Mansfield said.\n\nBut Jacob Carrel, the president of the Harvard Democrats, still gives Republicans credit for what they\u2019re doing. \u201cThey are a smaller group and because they\u2019re smaller, they are more tight knit, they\u2019re really able to defend their views,\u201d Carrel said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have debates against them and it\u2019s clear they\u2019re really able to defend themselves, probably because they have to with many of their friends.\u201d\n\nNot all famous conservative graduates are held in high esteem by the student body, however. The Crimson recently suggested that conservatives in the mold of Ted Cruz should no longer apply to Harvard in the future if they can\u2019t resist the \u201ctreachery\u201d of defaming the institution after graduation. (In fairness to the Crimson, Cruz suggested that Harvard Law School, his alma mater, hosted \u201cMarxists who believed in\u2026overthrowing the United States government.\u201d)\n\nMansfield said he thinks the addition of Cotton, Sasse and Sullivan to the Senate will improve the experience for conservatives at Harvard. \u201cI think it will inspire a lot of Harvard students who are Republican to see that it isn\u2019t a handicap to be conservative at Harvard,\u201d he said. But even Mansfield did not include Cruz as one of his own.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz, by the way, is not a Harvard man. He\u2019s Princeton,\u201d Mansfield said. \u201cJust going to Harvard Law School does not make you a Harvard Man. Cotton is a Harvard man. Sasse is, too. Elise Stefanik is a Harvard woman.

Rand Paul railed against \u201ca bunch of rich bankers on Wall Street getting bonuses on the backs of the middle class.\u201d Marco Rubio proposed a child tax credit (gasp!) paid for with a higher tax on upper-income earners, the rough equivalent of inviting Occupy Wall Street to use the showers at the Reagan Library.\n\nWorse, a group of young policy wonks known as the \u201cReformicons\u201d were gaining traction in elite party circles, championing a message that the party should move away from\u2014as The New York Times put it\u2014\u201corgiastic tax-cutting, the slashing of government programs, the championing of Wall Street.\u201d\n\n\n\nOver dinner at a restaurant on the Upper East Side, Larry Kudlow, the CNBC host and former Reagan administration economist, fretted over how to respond, along with his wife, Judith, Club for Growth founder Stephen Moore, and Alexandra Preate, a PR maven who has been described as \u201cThe Peggy Siegal of Republican politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of them have not dealt with these kind of issues before. We are, quite frankly, tryingto educate them.\u201d\n\nFor an answer, they looked back to a time when Western civilization was in danger of being obliterated, and a group of Cold War hawks formed the Committee on Present Danger to ring the alarm on the Soviet threat. They would call themselves \u201cThe Committee to Unleash American Prosperity\u201d and would attempt to educate GOP presidential candidates on the benefits of supply-side economics and stiffen their backbones.\n\nThe group took their idea to John Catsimatidis, the New York supermarket magnate\u2014and suitor of the New York Daily News\u2014who has single-handedly covered all of the expenses for \u201cThe Committee to Unleash American Prosperity\u201d so far. This has included nearly a half-dozen sit-down dinners for upwards of 60 people\u2014including some of the top contenders for the GOP crown\u2014at some of the most expensive restaurants in New York, like the Four Seasons and the 21 Club.\n\n\n\n\u201cRight now, we are all concerned that our kids are not going to have as good a life as we did. We have had a good 30 to 40 years. We have liked the last 30 to 40 years, and we are concerned about the next 30 to 40 years,\u201d Catsimatidis told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe have made enough money. You did and I did and the friends we are sitting with did. If our kids need an apartment, we pay for the kid\u2019s apartment. Do you think your kids will be able to do that for their kids?\u201d\n\nThe Committee\u2019s core group\u2014\u201ca bunch of old Reagan guys,\u201d as Kudlow put it, which grew to include Steve Forbes and supply-side patriarch Art Laffer\u2014believe that since World War II, the American economy has grown by 3\u00bd percent annually, but that over the last 15 years, growth has shrunk to 2 percent annually.\n\n\u201cThis growth slump has damaged investment, employment, incomes, poverty, social mobility, family life, and above all, lack of growth has damaged the American dream of opportunity for all,\u201d says a Committee memo that serves as something of a founding document. \u201cThe great American idea that you can come from humble background and rise to the top has been undermined\u2026As President Ronald Reagan taught us \u2018weakness at home leads to weakness abroad.\u2019 Unfortunately, American international leadership and influence has suffered in recent years proving the President Reagan\u2019s analysis was completely correct.\u201d\n\nThe Committee has come up with key principles that would make Uncle Ronnie proud. Among them: \u201ca flat tax; limited government spending; lite regulation; sound money; free trade; and the rule of Constitutional law.\u201d\n\nA strict flat tax aside, this sounds pretty much like the economic platform of every single Republican contender\u2014a point Kudlow concedes.\n\n\u201cYes, [their] rhetoric is not bad. There is a lack of detail and specifics however,\u201d he told The Daily Beast in a phone interview, after a luncheon honoring David Koch\u2019s charitable work. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a bunch of smart guys and most of them want to remain in the Reagan tradition of supply-side economics and tax cuts and deregulation. We get that.\u201d\n\nClub for Growth founder Moore said that the point of the Committee to Unleash American Prosperity was not so much to remind the GOP contenders of core principles as it was to explain the basics to them.\n\n\u201cMany of them have not dealt with these kind of issues before. We are, quite frankly, trying to educate them,\u201d he said.\n\nEconomic growth, Moore added, was actually being underplayed on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama gave a major speech the other day, and he said that the greatest problem facing the planet is climate change. I am sorry, but if he really believes that he is not putting growth first. No, the biggest problem facing the country right now is not climate change\u2014it is putting every American into a job and making sure they have higher wages.\u201d\n\nEven most Republicans, Moore added, were growing too \u201cspooked\u201d to push for more tax cuts for the rich.\n\n\u201cThe liberals are talking about redistribution. I don\u2019t think that the greed and envy agenda is as popular with voters as some of Reformicon friends seem to think it is.\u201d\n\nMoore said that many Republicans think ideas like \u201cthe flat tax are non-starters. It\u2019s a good thing they weren\u2019t around in the 1980s or Ronald Reagan would never have done his tax cuts. If you put the Rand Paul flat-tax proposal next to the Marco Rubio Reformicon proposal, 80, 90 percent of Republicans would be with Paul.\u201d\n\nThe Committee also thinks Republicans need to stop blaming Wall Street and finance for the economic collapse of 2008. \u201cWe know what Hillary Clinton is going to say,\u201d Moore said. \u201cShe is going to echo Elizabeth Warren and say these companies and banks didn\u2019t want any regulation and they drove the economy off the cliff. Republicans have to say that that isn\u2019t what happened at all. That Chris Dodd and Barney Frank and the government tried to subsidize all of these mortgages that people couldn\u2019t afford and it led to the biggest housing bust in the history of this country, and this was done by the government, not the private sector. It wasn\u2019t the market that failed. It was the government.\u201d\n\nWhen presented with the Committee\u2019s tenants, Ramesh Ponnuru, a senior editor at the National Review and an uber-Reformicon, countered that tax cuts for the sake of tax cuts have led to diminishing returns. If the American economy was spurred when the highest rates went from 70 percent to 40 percent, further reductions were naturally going to have less of an effect.\n\nReagan would agree with him, Ponnuru said. He noted that Ronnie\u2019s tax cuts were centered on middle-class tax relief, and not specifically aimed at growth. Ponnuru also mentioned that George W. Bush not only reduced taxes but that he extended the child tax credit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the Republican Party needs much convincing that lower tax rates are better and that growth is good. I think they need some help in finding ways to advance those goals while also offering tax relief to middle-class families,\u201d Ponnuru said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kudlow and Moore are pressing ahead. They say that every Republican running for president has agreed to appear before their group. Invitations are being extended to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, but they don\u2019t expect a response. Each candidate submits to a private, hour-long session with Kudlow, Moore, Laffer and Forbes, before giving a brief talk to the assembled Committee members and answering questions. The audience is invited exclusively by the organizers, and the guest list is made up mostly of opinion leaders in the conservative world\u2014hosts and correspondents from Fox News and Fox Business, editorialists with the Wall Street Journal and New York Post, think-tankers from Cato and Heritage and the Manhattan Institute.\n\nDespite their star-studded guest list, though, the meetings have been gaining a reputation for going off the rails. It was at a Committee meeting that Rudy Giuliani showed up and announced that Barack Obama didn\u2019t love America. At another Committee meeting, Rick Perry was scheduled as a speaker and fellow 2016 rival George Pataki showed up in the audience. At yet another one, Ohio Governor John Kasich was backed into a corner by a Manhattan Institute scholar who wanted to know why Kasich had expanded Medicaid in his state.\n\nFor now, The Committee to Unleash American Prosperity is sticking to swank dining spots in New York, but they have plans to take the show on the road, traveling to key primary and swing states to educate the public on what it takes to spur growth.\n\nA website, a social media campaign, and policy papers are also in the works.\n\n\u201cAll we want,\u201d said Kudlow, \u201cis for everybody to get richer.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:44.828+0000"}
{"entityId": 1549, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Future generations will look back on this decade and wonder how the world didn\u2019t act sooner to fight global warming and economic depression\u2014the twin threats to civilization.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2014, the economic impact of extreme weather related to climate change, combined with the inherent weakness of an economy suffering through a depression, produced a preliminary estimate of nearly no economic growth. This stark portrayal is a far cry from how the 0.1% GDP growth of the quarter has been presented. Rather, the narrative has gone something like this: Weather-related disruptions weighed upon business investment and consumer spending as the weak recovery continued.\n\nThus we continue to endure the two most consequential events of the recent decade without acknowledging either for what they are.\n\nIn the case of climate change, this timidity is understandable as change comes as weather and there will never be one clear event that signals indisputably that we\u2019ve entered the climate rapids. Fifty years from now, however, odds are that historians will mark the first decade of this new millennium as the point at which global warming became undeniable, particularly in its economic impacts.\n\nSimilarly, future economic historians will likely mark the financial crash of 2008 as the beginning of a depression (it would be nice if they would come back in time and told us when it will end). Here too, it is understandable because there is such a high noise-to-signal ratio amid an incessant drumbeat of often conflicting economic data and so many false starts that it is extremely difficult to define a depression except in retrospect.\n\nPart of the problem is that definitions of depression abound (the concept is so nebulous that the National Bureau of Economic Research, which officially calls recessions, demurs on the question of calling depressions). The description of depression that fits the present situation is a sustained period in which economic output falls substantially below an economy\u2019s potential. Now five years into our \u201crecovery\u201d the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the economy this year will still fall short of its potential output by $723 billion (and this gap comes against figures for potential output that have been steadily marked down by the CBO since 2008, essentially lowering the bar).\n\nRecognizing that things have truly changed has always been difficult for those living through inflection points in history. Those deepest inside the U.S. government and the intelligence community in the late 1980s were among the last to acknowledge that the Cold War was really over as the Soviet Union unraveled. \u201cThe Great Depression\u201d as a proper noun only came into popular use in the 1950s, long after the event was over. As the economy bounced around in the mid-1930s, there were many premature calls that the crisis had ended, including one by President Roosevelt in 1936, after three years of impressive recovery, but just before a vicious new recession hit, and unemployment rose to new highs.\n\nThis blindness is deeply embedded in human nature. Such is our commitment to the world view we forge during our formative years that often we can\u2019t see what is literally staring us in the face. Jerome Brumer, father of gestalt psychology, demonstrated this in a celebrated experiment in which he showed people a deck of cards salted with the wrong colors for different suits such as a red ace of spades. When the cards were turned over, most people saw them as normal. Only when they could linger for long periods would they see that something was amiss, but even then some people could not put their finger on what was wrong.\n\nDoes it matter whether and when we put a label on an era? Yes, greatly. Our reticence to state the obvious but unproven may be understandable, and even prudent, but it is not helpful. Recognizing that the changing climate carries with it harsh economic consequences might spur action to limit the harm. The Obama administration just did its part releasing a draft assessment of climate change asserting that it is already hurting Americans. Still, our current posture that global warming is a nebulous, far-off problem largely explains our complacency about a threat that has in the past been a civilization-killer.\n\nSimilarly, while economists will argue over whether the present period of near zero growth and stretched household finances is a depression long after the economy really does recover, acknowledging that for all but a tiny group of Americans the economy is in depression would do a world of good. For one thing, there might be less push for deficit reduction and more pressure for programs that might improve the incomes of ordinary Americans. One school of thought holds that FDR\u2019s false belief in 1936 that the depression was over led his administration to tighten credit, pushing the fragile economy back into recession.\n\nSo, let\u2019s acknowledge the obvious. The upside is that we might muster the political will to develop policies that match reality. Do we want those yet unborn historians (who are going to be royally annoyed about the world we bequeath them anyway) wondering how it was that we ignored what was staring us in the face?", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:45.106+0000"}

What future crises are we now creating in Gaza and the Levant?\n\nSo Congress may be about to leave town for the summer without doing anything about the border crisis. President Obama asked for $3.7 billion in emergency funds. The Senate came up with around $2.7 billion. The House started north of a billion but finally shaved its number down to $659 million. Not much room for compromise there\u2014and indeed it turned out Thursday that the House Republicans couldn\u2019t even pass their own bill! So here\u2019s yet another problem we can\u2019t fix.\n\nTo which you may be saying, \u201cYes, maybe we should do something or other about those kids, but hey, the violence down in those countries, that\u2019s not our problem.\u201d I urge you to think again. It is our problem. We did a lot to create it. And ruminating over that history should make us all shudder to think, as we gaze to the Mideast, what future problems we\u2019re helping to create today.\n\nThe children are coming from three Central American countries\u2014Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. Is it just a coincidence that these are all countries in which the American hand has weighed particularly heavily? Guatemala we just wrecked starting in 1954, with the CIA-directed coup against land reformer Jacobo Arbenz that led to a military dictatorship and, eventually, 36 years of civil war that ended in 1996. El Salvador was, with Nicaragua (more on it later), the focus of Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201ckeep the commies out of Harlingen, Texas\u201d doctrine; a few billion Yanqui dollars poured into the country to arm death squads and perpetuate another wrenching civil war, which took 75,000 lives and ended in 1992.\n\nWe haven\u2019t intervened as much in Honduras, although it was, many say, the original \u201cbanana republic,\u201d built from a backwater into a major banana producer by American corporate interests who created a small and very conservative elite that ruled the country for decades. Honduras, of course, just experienced a military coup against a populist reform president in 2009, a coup that the Obama administration, to its lasting discredit, backed.\n\nNicaragua, as noted, was also a target of Reagan\u2019s, and we started a hideous cycle of violence there after the Sandinistas had the nerve to overthrow our dictator. But after the Sandinistas agreed to elections in the late 1980s\u2014and the U.S.-backed coalition won, and the Sandinistas peacefully ceded power\u2014Nicaragua pulled itself together comparatively well. And Costa Rica, for a host of historical reasons, has always been more stable than its neighbors.\n\nSo in the three crisis countries, or at least in two of them (Guatemala and El Salvador), there\u2019s a pattern: U.S.-sponsored civil wars tore the country apart in the 1980s. What happened next? As Ryan Grim and Roque Planas put it in a terrific Huffington Post piece tracing this history in greater depth, \u201cWith wars come refugees.\u201d Terrified citizens of these nations started running to the United States by the tens of thousands.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not all the United States\u2019 fault. People make their own choices in life. But we financed civil wars and counterinsurgencies in these countries to the tune of many billions of dollars.\n\nWhen they got here, there was nothing for them. Depending on how old they were, they or their kids formed gangs in Los Angeles and elsewhere in the 1990s. We responded to that by \u201cgetting tough\u201d on crime, throwing thousands of them in jail. Then when they got out of jail, we deported them back. We escalated the drug war\u2014we had some success in Colombia, which merely pushed much of the cocaine trade into Central America. The ex-gang members we deported created extremely violent societies, societies where 10-year-old kids are recruited into new gangs and threatened with death if they don\u2019t join, and it\u2019s from those societies that today\u2019s children are fleeing.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not all the United States\u2019 fault. People make their own choices in life. But we financed civil wars and counterinsurgencies in these countries to the tune of many billions of dollars. It led to massive amounts of death, and many thousands of refugees. The violence that incubated that generation of Guatemalans and Salvadorans took the form of bombs and bullets that were stamped to say \u201cMade in the USA.\u201d And now the children of that violence are risking their lives to flee it. And Congress has left town.\n\nWhat future crises are we germinating today, 6,000 miles to the east, that we will similarly wash our hands of 30 years from now? God only knows. It seems to me that the main thing being accomplished by the eight-year Israeli blockade of Gaza, supported by the United States (both Bush and Obama), is the creation of thousands of young, angry, militant Palestinians. The unemployment rate in Gaza is 40 percent; for young men up to 29 years of age, it\u2019s near 60 percent. Those are both more than double the numbers from before the blockade. Add this lack of anything resembling opportunity to the inevitability of demography, and Israel, as many have observed, is lighting a fuse (actually, we supply the matches; $3 billion a year\u2019s worth of them) that may look long now but will one day ignite in its face.\n\nA bit further to the east, I\u2019ve read that the Islamic State (the former ISIS) has printed maps in which its black-and-white flag stretches over the entirety of Iraq, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon (one militant says in a recruiting video: \u201cWe understand no borders \u2026 and we will even go to Jordan and Lebanon with no problems\u201d). Jordan isn\u2019t a particularly free country right now, but it is the first Arab country to have a trade agreement with the United States. Lebanon is in duress because of Hezbollah, but it is comparatively free, with a vigorous press and a long history of intellectual engagement with the West. If these countries were to fall into that darkness, the tragedy would be enormous, to say nothing of having to deal with a reactionary caliphate that ruled over a population of more than 60 million people.\n\nAgain, it obviously wouldn\u2019t be wholly the United States\u2019 fault. But, again, our choices have had consequences. The Iraq War that we started unleashed ISIS, and the Syrian civil war that we have done nothing to stop has made it stronger. And if the worst comes true five or 10 or 30 years from now? Well, if the border crisis is our guide, we\u2019ll forget that we had anything to do with it, and we\u2019ll do something new to make things worse still. As Faulkner told us, the past is never dead and isn\u2019t even past.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:45.408+0000"}

They were wrong.\n\nReuters did a dumb thing.\n\nOn Monday, the news agency released a new Reuters/Ipsos poll demonstrating how President Obama\u2019s poll numbers paled in comparison to those of make-believe characters.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s the earnest Josiah Bartlet from The West Wingor the manipulative Frank Underwood in House of Cards, Americans prefer television presidents to their real-life POTUS, President Barack \u201cNo Drama\u201d Obama,\u201d the accompanying Reuters article reads.\n\nThe survey stacked Obama\u2019s favorability numbers against those of liberal-teddy-bear Bartlet, the morally bankrupt Underwood, Battlestar Galactica\u2019s Laura Roslin, Scandal\u2019s Fitzgerald Grant, and 24\u2019s David Palmer. (Dennis Haysbert, who played the tough, African-American Democratic commander-in-chief Palmer, has argued that his character actually helped lay the groundwork for public acceptance of a black president in real-world USA.)\n\n\u201cA news organization spent good money that it could have spent on reporting conducting this poll [instead],\u201d Mother Jones editor Nick Baumann responded indignantly to the Reuters-Ipsos poll on Monday.\n\nThese characters are fictional, and even the morally ambiguous or Machiavellian ones are written to be sympathetic or alluring for the sake of compelling TV.\n\nThere are many obvious reasons as to why this polling is outstandingly useless. For one, President Bartlet never invaded a country you didn\u2019t want him to attack, nor did he ever impose tax hikes you weren\u2019t fond of. In fact, he didn\u2019t invade any countries, or raise any taxes, because he is president only in a land of make believe.\n\nThese characters are fictional, and even the morally ambiguous or Machiavellian ones are written to be sympathetic or alluring for the sake of compelling TV. This is about as instructive as polling the American people about who is the superior leader: Barack Obama, Santa Claus, or the cutest Ewok from the Star Wars franchise.\n\nFictional characters and celebrities are already at a pop-cultural advantage when it comes to approval ratings. If you want evidence that citizens believe Tom Hanks is more trustworthy than Barack Obama, then there\u2019s a poll out there for you .\n\nReuters isn\u2019t alone. For instance, the left-leaning firm Public Policy Polling acts out its mischievous side by asking ridiculous, unabashedly troll-y questions, such as whether or not hipsters should pay a tax for being \u201cannoying,\u201d or if George Zimmerman would be a good presidential candidate.\n\nAnd the Reuters survey isn\u2019t even the first time a charming, fictional POTUS was pitted against an actual politician. Shortly before the 2000 election, an NBC poll showed that The West Wing\u2019s Bartlet would get more votes than Bush and Gore put together. So it\u2019s hardly news that a popular fake president would score higher than a real one who is still alive and making policy decisions in a politically polarized America.\n\nSure, no news organization is above click-bait. Click-bait can be fun. Click-bait is often good. Click-bait can help subsidize other, more valuable functions of a news organization.\n\nBut this was just dumb.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:45.678+0000"}

Apparently, eight years of backseat-driving the presidency wasn\u2019t enough, and old habits die hard.\n\nBut what about the rest of us? We\u2019d all love for our favorite war criminal who looks like a friendly boiled potato to weigh in on our issues. We need Dick. We are thirsty for his signature wit, warmth, and homespun wisdom. He is like a grandfather to us, the kind who seems like he should have died a while ago and yet stubbornly clings to life. Or, in Cheney\u2019s case, relevance.\n\nSo here, for the first time, The Daily Beast is proud to present our newest advice column: Ask a Dick (Cheney), where real, everyday, imaginary Americans ask the man who, thank God, never was president, for advice how to handle their problems.\n\nDear Dick,\n\nI\u2019ve been married for three years. My husband is funny, kind, thoughtful, smart, and great with my family. Everyone always comments on what a great match we are. When we got together, we\u2019d always discussed having children eventually. But every time I bring it up, he comes up with another reason to delay, mostly financial. Money is not a problem for us, but he seems to feel like unless we have $50,000 squirreled away, we\u2019ll be bad parents. Dick, I\u2019m 34 years old, and I don\u2019t have forever!

Your husband is emotionally terrorizing you, and when you capitulate to him, your standing is weakened, not only in the family but throughout the free world. By tolerating this insult, you broadcast, loud and clear, that you are someone who can be bullied into submission by the court of international opinion. Because if you cannot defend yourself against babylessness, what can you defend yourself against?\n\nThere is just one move here: Form a vast, powerful Coalition of the Willing within the your home. Gather up everything, animate and inanimate, that may be on your side, including the dog, Sub Zero freezer, toilet, wallpaper, your friend who came by to watch The Bachelorette, etc. Stick googly-eyes on the things that don\u2019t actually have eyes, just to reinforce the point that there is nowhere that he can go to escape your ironclad will.\n\nThen, Phase 2: While he is sleeping, poke holes in the condoms and go sleep with his best friend. Announce to everyone the next day you are pregnant.\n\nYour fetus will be greeted as a liberator,\n\nDick\n\nDear Dick,\n\nI recently bought my first house, and while I knew when I got it that it was a \u201cfixer-upper,\u201d I\u2019ve since discovered major problems that the inspector missed. In fact, it may well need a new foundation. Should I spend money that I don\u2019t particularly have to fix it, or put it on the market and cross my fingers that the new owners are as na\u00efve as I was?\n\nSincerely,\n\nDavid in Chicago\n\nDear David,\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight here: Whatever issues the foundation are experiencing come as a direct result of your own shortsightedness and inability to follow the courageous and sagacious vision of the previous owner.\n\nHere you are, writing to a damn advice columnist, while you could be pouring everything you have into that foundation. You are willfully blind to the impact of your actions. Also, do you ever go golfing and/or talk about climate change? If so, stop and return your attention to the matter at hand. Each time you open your mouth about climate change, a new crack develops in that foundation because it is emboldened by your appeasement.\n\nNow: What should you do? Declare a War on Foundations and burn the house down.\n\nWorks every time,\n\nDick\n\nDear Dick,\n\nI just graduated and, despite the odds, have landed my dream job in the communications department of a nonprofit.

{"entityId": 1554, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Fifty years after the Freedom Summer, black voters are more powerful than ever. It\u2019s time for both parties to realize this, and start competing for their support in earnest.\n\nFor the first time in our history, according to the Census Bureau, blacks are now voting at a higher rate than whites. Roughly two out of three eligible blacks voted in the 2012 election, which is a greater percentage than the number of non-Hispanic whites who turned out to the polls. And while the presence of President Barack Obama on the ballot for re-election almost certainly drove up turnout, blacks are still the only ethnic group to show a significant increase in voting from 2008 to 2012.\n\nNowhere is this trend more noteworthy than in the South where, as Nate Cohn recently argued in The New York Times, black voters may decide who controls the Senate next year. \u201cIf Democrats win the South and hold the Senate,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthey will do so because of Southern black voters.\u201d\n\nFifty years after the Freedom Summer, the expanding political clout of black voters in the South is welcome news. Now we need to see the power of the black vote expand nationwide, which will only happen when Republicans and Democrats alike are forced to fight for their support.\n\nGiven that roughly 90 percent of blacks are committed supporters of the Democratic Party, I suspect they will take this voting bloc for granted by promising more government support and handouts\u2014belittling blacks by assuming that a majority of us are interested in \u201cfree\u201d stuff from the government. I also assume that they\u2019ll continue pushing the canard that the Republican push for voter ID laws is an attempt to disenfranchise black voters. This is despite the fact that black turnout actually increased last cycle in Georgia and Indiana, two states with some of the toughest voter ID laws.\n\nSo what will the Republicans do, and will they find a way to make significant inroads with communities of color?\n\nI believe Senator Thad Cochran\u2019s re-election should give Republicans around the country insight on how to effectively bring black voters to the polls. Cochran\u2019s strong showing in the black community is the only thing that kept him from losing to Tea Party challenger Chris McDaniel. This happened because Cochran did what many Republicans seem reluctant to do: Ask for the support of black voters, and make a real, substantive argument for that support.\n\n\u201cNow we need to see the power of the black vote expand nationwide, which will only happen when Republicans and Democrats alike are forced to fight for their support.\u201d\n\nRepublicans need a positive message for people of color, and they need to state that message clearly, and with conviction. Senator Rand Paul is already making this kind of aggressive pitch to black voters, and I hope that other national Republican figures will follow suit.\n\nThe GOP insists that they\u2019re catching on and trying to attract the increasingly active black vote. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a number of steps at the Republican National Committee to have a meaningful presence in black communities across the country,\u201d Orlando Watson, a Republican National Committee spokesman, told The Daily Beast. \u201cNorth and South. East and West. Everywhere we go, we\u2019re listening to black voters, sharing our vision of a better country and building bridges.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Republicans need to expand who they are talking to in communities of color. Cozying up to the NAACP or church ministers isn\u2019t going to cut it anymore. My friend Marc Morial, president and CEO of the Urban League, has been diligent about bringing Republicans to his organization\u2019s meetings and conventions.\n\nTwo years ago I went down to speak at the Urban League\u2019s annual convention in New Orleans and was met with a few jeers and whistles during my remarks as to why blacks should give the Republican Party a chance. But as soon as my speech was over, I can\u2019t tell you the number of people who approached me to thank me for coming and sharing my views.\n\nMany said they agreed with much of what I said, but felt it would be improper to support Republicans because the GOP often acts like wooing black voters is a waste of time. If Republicans don\u2019t roll up their sleeves, develop a pitch, and ask blacks to support them, they have only themselves to blame if black voters stay firmly in the Democratic camp.\n\nBlacks are voting in greater and stronger numbers than ever before, and it\u2019s time both parties woke up and started competing for their loyalty in earnest. Given that blacks comprise only 13 percent of the American population yet continue to flex their muscle when it comes to voter turnout, candidates from both political parties would be wise to seek support of blacks at the polls.\n\nWith one party taking blacks for granted and the other trying to gain traction with black voters, it will be interesting to see what their politicians do to tap into this reenergized voter demographic. Let\u2019s hope Republicans and Democrats focus on the important issues facing communities of color, rather than attacking or demonizing their opponents by using race as a wedge issue.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:46.297+0000"}

With her 61 percent approval rating and a talent for connecting with women and minority audiences in particular, she is uniquely able to go into states where even the president and vice president struggle to motivate voters and donors.\n\n\n\nCase in point: Georgia, where the first lady appeared last week with Democratic Senate candidate Michelle Nunn for a voter registration rally and fundraiser.\n\n\n\n\u201cMichelle Nunn does not want to be caught within camera range with the president right now,\u201d said Charles Bullock, a longtime professor of political science at the University of Georgia. \u201cThe president could raise funds in the state, but for Democrats there would be a question whether it would be a net gain to do so. It would simply underscore the Republican message that that \u2018Michelle Nunn will be Barack Obama\u2019s senator, not yours.\u2019 The first lady does not present that problem to the same degree.\u201d\n\nDemocrats declined to say how much money Mrs. Obama has raised for Democrats this year, but without question, no Democrat has been more prolific than House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who has raised $80 million for Democrats this cycle and more than $400 million in the last 12 years.\n\n\n\nAlthough Pelosi is often the center of Republican attack ads against House Democrats, she is a superstar when it comes to motivating large donors in her own party.\n\n\u201cSomebody like Nancy Pelosi is perceived as far more partisan than the first lady and far more liberal than many voters,\u201d said Jennifer Lawless. the director of the Women & Politics Institute at American University. \u201cBut when you look at a pool of potential donors, they look just like her. She\u2019s the kind of person they want to hear from.\u201d\n\nGender is not part of the problem.\n\nIn addition to Pelosi, and other surrogates, Democrats point out that a number of their Senate candidates are prolific fundraisers in their own rights. The top three highest-grossing fundraising quarters for any Democrats this cycle belong to women\u2014Sen. Kay Hagan in North Carolina, Kentucky hopeful Alison Lundergan Grimes, and Georgia\u2019s Michelle Nunn,\n\nHagan and Nunn are also significantly out-raising their male opponents. In Hagan\u2019s case, she is swamping Republican Thom Tillis, with $16.7 million raised, compared to Tillis\u2019 $4.7 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Nunn has nearly twice as much as her Republican opponent, David Perdue, with $9.2 million to Perdue\u2019s $5.8 million.\n\nOn the GOP side, Michigan Republican Terri Lynn Land has pulled in $8.7 million, compared to her Democratic rival, Rep, Gary Peters, who has raised $6.9 million. But other female candidates for the Republicans are not faring as well. Monica Wehby in Oregon and Joni Ernst are both trailing their Democratic opponents\u2019 totals and no woman has emerged nationally for the GOP as a go-to surrogate in the way that the first lady or Nancy Pelosi have in 2014.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem for Republicans is that they don\u2019t have a lot of high-profile candidates this time,\u201d said Jennifer Lawless. \u201cMy hunch is that when you look at their most competitive races, women are not necessarily in the mix this year.\u201d\n\nUntil women sit in the highest ranks of Republican leadership, it will be hard for GOP women to match Democrats like Pelosi and Hillary Clinton\u2019s fundraising dominance, Lawless said. Their gender is not part of the problem.\n\n\u201cAlthough nobody likes doing it, study after study shows that men and women are equally successful raising money once they become candidates,\u201d she said. \u201cThe notion that women don\u2019t like to raise money is a myth.

So far, three members have emerged as top con-tenders.\n\nThree Republican lawmakers are emerging as leading candidates to replace Rep. Mike Rogers as chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee, after Rogers announced Friday that he would not be seeking re-election to Congress.\n\nWhile Rogers has said he will continue to serve out his term until the current session of Congress ends, the race to become his successor has already begun.\n\nIn interviews with GOP House members and staffers, the top three Republicans emerging to succeed the Michigan lawmaker from his own committee are Rep. Jeff Miller from Florida, Rep. Pete King from New York, and Rep. Devin Nunes from California. House GOP sources say Rep. Mike Pompeo is also seeking the job, but he\u2019s only served on the House Permanent Select Committee for a little over a year so the odds aren\u2019t in his favor.\n\nUnlike most standing committees in Congress where the party\u2019s caucus vote for the next chairman, the Speaker of the House alone gets to appoint the next chief. Luckily for the top three contenders, they have good relations with current House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nThe gig is nice work if you can get it. The chairman of the intelligence committee is one of a handful of lawmakers briefed on the most classified assessments and programs from the military, CIA and other intelligence agencies. The chairman also has considerable authority to declassify those secrets and is often courted by the Sunday talk shows as a guest to comment on breaking international news.\n\nOf the three candidates, Miller has the most seniority on the House intelligence committee. He has served on the committee since 2009. Rep. Mac Thornberry, a Republican from Texas, is the only member on the committee with more seniority than Miller, but Thornberry will likely be the next chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and therefore is not eligible to also chair the Intelligence Committee.\n\nMiller\u2019s chief of staff, Dan McFaul, told The Daily Beast Friday that his boss \u201ctakes that committee assignment very seriously. We believe the world continues to be a very dangerous place, if the speaker places his confidence in Congressman Miller to oversee the Intelligence Committee, he would give 110 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe the world continues to be a very dangerous place, if the speaker places his confidence in Congressman [Jeff] Miller to oversee the intelligence committee, he would give 110 percent.\u201d\n\nAs the top man on the House Veteran Affairs Committee, Miller already has experience as a committee chairman. But while Miller supported Boehner\u2019s bid to become House speaker, he does not have a particularly close relationship with him.\n\nOn the other hand, Nunes, who has the least seniority of the three top contenders, is close to Boehner. In 2006, Nunes managed Boehner\u2019s successful campaign for House majority leader. He\u2019s also one of the speaker\u2019s closest friends in Congress.\n\n\u201cThis is something I have had a long interest in because of the U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. I was elected right after 9-11,\u201d Nunes told The Daily Beast. \u201cI have learned a lot under Chairman Rogers, and when he left the chairmanship I had planned on running. I just did not know it was going to be so soon.\u201d\n\nNunes, in some ways, also represents an astute political choice for Boehner who has had to face rebellions from Tea Party Republicans over extending the debt limit. Nunes has supported his party\u2019s leaders on the debt limit and the budget deal, but he has also been the most vocal member of the House Intelligence Committee, calling for more hearings into the 9/11 anniversary terrorist attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, an issue that remains an enduring concern for many Tea Party Republicans.\n\nRep. Pete King has also been highly critical of the Obama administration on Benghazi. Despite his membership in the House Intelligence Committee, King supported the creation of a special Congressional committee to investigate the terrorist attack and the administration\u2019s response to it.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Beast, King said he would continue to investigate Benghazi if he was chairman \u201cuntil we get every answer to our questions.\u201d\n\nOne argument in favor of King is that as a former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, he has considerable national security experience. In fact, he still serves on that panel to this day. \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor to be considered,\u201d King told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe only reason I am not more up front about this is because this is the decision for the speaker.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, King has also announced that he is running for the presidency in 2016. When asked if he would give up his run for the White House if he became chairman of the Intelligence Committee, King said, \u201cLet\u2019s take one thing at a time.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:49.515+0000"}

In the next three weeks, he has just three public events on his schedule: two meetings with local Democratic groups in New Hampshire and one appearance in Iowa, at the Democratic Party\u2019s Hall of Fame ceremony. For a former governor\u2014which Chafee, who served one term as Rhode Island\u2019s executive, is\u2014a spare dance card is not atypical.\n\nBut Chafee isn\u2019t in retirement. He\u2019s running for president.\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard of him at all, you may know that Chafee is a Republican, turned independent, turned Democrat who was appointed to the Senate after the death of his father, John Chafee. He looks like a cross between Jeff Daniels and Steve Doocy, with a demeanor reminiscent of Ron Paul.\n\nThose who know Chafee call him \u201cLinc\u201d for short. The last of a dying breed of liberal Republicans, he earned the distinction of being the only GOP senator to vote against the war in Iraq. He placed a symbolic vote for George H.W. Bush for president in 2004, as a means of expressing his disapproval of W. Later, in his time as Rhode Island governor during the Great Recession, he earned the nicknames \u201cGovernor Gump\u201d and \u201cGovernor Grinch,\u201d the latter after a fight over what to call Christmas trees.\n\nChafee announced his campaign for the Democratic nomination on June 3 during a foreign policy speech at George Mason University in Virginia, in front of fewer than 100 people. The address was supposed to set Chafee up as the anti-war alternative to Hillary Clinton, but that message was somewhat overshadowed by his call for America to \u201cjoin the rest of the world\u201d and convert to the metric system. \u201cI happened to live in Canada as they completed the process,\u201d Chafee smiled as he prepared for his punchline. \u201cBelieve me, it\u2019s easy. It doesn\u2019t take long before 34 degrees is hot.\u201d\n\nSince the announcement, Chafee has remained in the Northeast. His campaign strategy, he told me, is to focus on New Hampshire and Iowa first, but \u201cbeing in Rhode Island, New Hampshire\u2019s a lot easier.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a high-budget operation,\u201d he added. Yet he has been vocally indifferent about fundraising. His wife, Stephanie Chafee, was the biggest donor to his gubernatorial campaign.\n\n\u201cHe may just want to have his views on some of these issues register, but the question, to me, is: Does he intend to mount a credible campaign? And I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nChafee doesn\u2019t seem to have an interest in putting together a traditional campaign staff, either. The Chafee 2016 operation consists of two people: Debbie Rich, his communications director who has been with him since 1997, when he was mayor of Warwick, and Jonathan Stevens, his campaign manager and best friend since first grade. Oh, and there\u2019s also \u201ca strong core of loyal volunteers,\u201d according to Rich.\n\nHis foreign policy advisers are mostly \u201cfriends that care about these issues\u201d and \u201cprofessors,\u201d he said.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s no surprise, then, that he is polling at around 1 percent.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little unusual, what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Michael Trainor, a former Chafee spokesman, told me. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very na\u00efve understanding of running a national campaign. He may just want to have his views on some of these issues register, but the question, to me, is: Does he intend to mount a credible campaign? And I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\n***\n\nChafee was born on March 26, 1953, to an affluent family in Providence, Rhode Island. His great-grandfather, Henry Lippitt, great-great uncle, Charles Warren Lippitt, and father, John Chafee, were all governors of Rhode Island. A Republican, John Chafee left that post, which he held while his son was in elementary school, to be the secretary of the Navy under President Nixon and then, finally, a senator.\n\nFrom his father\u2019s political career, Chafee said, he learned that \u201cthere\u2019s always room for compromise, but if you feel strongly about something and the quest for the compromise is taking you beyond your convictions, it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d\n\nIn the eighth grade, Chafee was elected to his first position: class representative. The following year, he enrolled at Phillips Academy, the boarding school in Andover, Massachusetts. There he became friends with a classmate named Jeb Bush. \u201cIn the 10th grade, we were in a dorm with only 11 students,\u201d Chafee remembered. \u201cIn the course of that year, we got to be good friends, I\u2019d say.\u201d Chafee and Bush talked about politics, he told me: \u201cIt was national issues, then, with Vietnam and so much going on. Both our fathers were Republicans, so we had something in common.\u201d They lost touch after high school, Chafee said, and wouldn\u2019t cross paths again until decades later, in Washington, when Chafee was a senator and Bush the governor of Florida, testifying in front of a committee Chafee served on.\n\nChafee went on to Brown University in Providence. He would admit, during his 1999 campaign for the Senate, that while there, he experimented with cocaine. \u201cI knew the question was going to come up,\u201d Chafee told me. Then, he chuckled: \u201cI wanted to answer it as bluntly as possible.\u201d\n\nAfter graduation, like many young adults in the mid-\u201970s, Chafee wanted to do something different. \u201cI had worked summers in construction as a laborer,\u201d he said. \u201cI always admired the tradespeople and thought after college I wanted to continue that life and get a skill.\u201d He went to a trade school in Montana, where he \u201cgot mildly competent\u201d at horseshoeing and then \u201cvery lucky\u201d when he was hired to work at a racetrack. He ended up in Alberta, Canada, where he remained for seven years. He\u2019s wistful about this time of his life. \u201cI think I put shoes on 5,000 horses,\u201d he said, \u201cI loved it.\u201d\n\n***\n\nChafee returned to Rhode Island and in 1986, he entered politics\u2014a Republican like his father. He was elected to the Warwick City Council, where he would remain until he became mayor, in 1992.\n\nMeanwhile, nationally, the Republican Party began a transformation that would leave little room for politicians like the Chafees. The Clinton era saw Northeastern Republicans and Southern Democrats gradually become endangered species, as the Republican Party anchored itself in the South.\n\n\u201cJust hearing from my dad about that group that came over from the House into the Senate,\u201d Chafee remembered. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have much patience for anybody that wasn\u2019t 100 percent on agenda\u2026It didn\u2019t used to be that way. It got to be pretty militaristic.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a senator and as a secretary of state, you would have to try very hard to find some [Hillary Clinton] accomplishments, and that speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nIn October 1999, the elder Chafee died of congestive heart failure at 77. Obituaries remembered him as the \u201cSenate centrist.\u201d For John Chafee, President Clinton said, \u201ccivility was not simply a matter of personal manners. He believed it was essential to the preservation of our democratic system.\u201d\n\nWhat he learned most from his father, Lincoln Chafee said, was that everything in his political career \u201ccame down to just his courage.\u201d\n\nChafee was appointed to serve the remainder of the Senate term. \u201cI knew when I got in, in 1999, that\u2014uh, a little bit about the atmosphere there and the partisanship,\u201d he said. \u201cI had, I think, a pretty good idea of what I was getting into.\u201d\n\nWhat he got into, it turned out, would make up the entirety of his case for his presidential campaign 15 years later.\n\n***\n\n\u201cEven before the Iraq War, I\u2019d set my course,\u201d Chafee explained. The pro-choice, fiscally conservative, environmentally conscious, endangered species-protecting, skeptical-of-U.S.-military-intervention convictions he held then and now, his \u201cbedrock\u201d convictions, did not align gracefully with the Bush-Cheney doctrine from the start.\n\nHe was cordial with members of his party, he said, and he attended the right lunches and events, but \u201cby the time the Iraq War came, in October 2002, they knew I was a pretty independent voter.\u201d\n\nIn his presidential announcement speech, Chafee outlined the \u201cprimary three\u201d reasons for his decision to become the only Republican senator to vote against the war. The first was his fear that it would be for the next generation what Vietnam had been for his. Second, \u201cI had learned in the nine months of the Bush-Cheney administration prior to September 11 not to trust their word.\u201d Third, the war in Iraq had long been on the \u201chawks\u2019\u201d wish list, and a visit to the CIA convinced him \u201cthere was no intelligence\u201d that made the case for intervention.\n\nThe fact that Hillary Clinton did not arrive at the same conclusion is the central component of Chafee\u2019s campaign platform.\n\n\u201cYou always assume that different things, scenarios, can occur,\u201d Chafee said when I asked if he believed he could win the Democratic nomination. \u201cMy assumption has always been that Secretary Clinton is not going to be the nominee. Different things are going to catch up with her. The Clinton Foundation, the emails, and I\u2019ve always thought the Iraq War.\u201d\n\nIn the current foreign policy debate, Chafee sees the case for Chafee 2016.\n\n\u201cI think as the neocon approach so damaged our American credibility [and] as we saw there were no weapons of mass destruction, and as we saw chaos engulf the region, I suppose that\u2019s when I started thinking, \u2018What this country needs is the people who had the courage, under moments of high pressure, to make good decisions.\u2019\u201d By which Chafee means, of course, someone like him.\n\nJeb Bush, Chafee said, made the Iraq War all the more relevant by saying he would have made the same decision his brother did. \u201cThat\u2019s my issue\u2014where we fit in the world and international approach,\u201d Chafee said.\n\nClinton, he argued, would be \u201ctoo much of a continuation of the Bush-Cheney approach to the world. It\u2019s too much of a continuation of that hawkish approach. There have been several articles about her closeness with the neocons, and that\u2019s my biggest concern.\u201d (Chafee said he mostly reads The New York Times for international coverage.)\n\nAsked how he would handle ISIS, Chafee told me he would not support the airstrikes in Iraq and Syria that have been endorsed by the similarly intervention-apprehensive Rand Paul, who is seeking the Republican nomination. \u201cI call them extra-judicial assassinations,\u201d Chafee said of drone strikes. To combat ISIS, he said, \u201cI believe first we have to understand who they are.\u201d He claimed ISIS is \u201cevolving\u201d from the \u201cabsolute barbarism\u201d that first got the world\u2019s attention.\n\n***\n\nBeyond foreign policy, Chafee told me he wasn\u2019t very impressed by Clinton\u2019s performance in the Senate. \u201cShe liked to go her own way,\u201d he remembered. \u201cYou have to work to get her to compromise, and she likes to do it her way\u2026The truth is, if you look at Hillary Clinton\u2019s career, there aren\u2019t a lot of accomplishments. Certainly, health care back in 1994 is a perfect example. There were a large number of Republicans, my dad being one, that wanted a health-care bill, and she was very uncompromising back then. As a senator and as a secretary of state, you would have to try very hard to find some accomplishments, and that speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nBut it's only on the topic of international relations that Chafee can attempt to differentiate himself from the other candidates \u2013 and even then, it's a stretch to suggest he has something to offer that no one else does. Bernie Sanders voted against the Iraq war, too. Chafee can only argue that his nay was of more consequence and required more courage because of the R- next to his name at the time it was cast.\n\nSo Chafee's bet is this: Clinton will falter, and foreign policy will become so important to Democratic primary voters that he will surpass Martin O\u2019Malley, the former mayor of Baltimore and governor of Maryland who oddly enough helped, while chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, to convince the then-independent Chafee to join the party. (O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign said he would not be available to discuss the matter) and he will trample Sanders, the much better known Senator from Vermont who is polling competitively with Clinton and who history also shows was correct about Iraq.\n\nFor this to work, Chafee's opposition to the war would need to be compelling enough that no one would bother to notice his record as governor of Rhode Island, which received mixed reviews at best \u2013 something which will only get harder for him as he continues to criticize his opponents. Of O\u2019Malley, Chafee told me, \u201che is going to have some issues\u201d with his policies on crime in Baltimore, which he characterized as \u201ca short-term benefit\u201d whose \u201clong-term effects were dire.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost people think that Linc Chafee was an honest guy who was certainly interested in making the state better, but he lacked the tool kit for strong leadership,\u201d Wendy Schiller, a professor of political science at Brown, told me. \u201cWhen I say the tool kit, I mean he\u2019s not a great public communicator and he\u2019s not interested in horse trading, and when you are governor in a state with a powerful legislature, you have to horse trade.\u201d\n\nPeople grew frustrated with Chafee, Schiller said, because his time in office was \u201cviewed as a wasted opportunity for the state of Rhode Island for four years. I think people will say he\u2019s a nice guy, but they\u2019re very disappointed that he didn\u2019t step up.\u201d\n\nFacing a primary challenge, Chafee decided not to run for a second term. Nevertheless, he told me that he felt like he could leave the office to focus on national and international issues because he had gotten the job done. \u201cI said, \u2018I can leave my governor\u2019s job. We\u2019re going in the right direction in Rhode Island.\u2019\u201d\n\nChafee did admit that he regretted the Christmas tree debate, however.\n\nIn December 2011, Chafee, who is Episcopalian, told a staffer in his office to just use the same tree lightning invitations the previous governor had sent out. They referred, he didn't realize, to a \"holiday tree.\" Chafee ended up being branded \"Governor Grinch\" by a Republican legislator, and told \"They're not happy with you governor!\" by a livid Bill O'Reilly on Fox News.\n\nChafee now says he should have fostered a healthier discussion on the issue, which meant more to Rhode Island's Catholic residents than he realized at the time. Still, he said, \u201cI kind of wanted to call it a holiday tree\u2026 It\u2019s a public building.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:49.855+0000"}

Recent polls put Republican former lieutenant governor James \u201cDuke\u201d Aiona over his Democratic opponent by seven points. Or Illinois, which Obama won by 17 points and which hasn\u2019t swung Republican for president since 1988. There, Republican businessman Bruce Rauner has opened up an eight-point lead over Democratic incumbent Pat Quinn\u2014the closest Quinn has come in months. Meanwhile, in true blue Massachusetts, a state that is conservative shorthand for liberal licentiousness, Republican Charlie Baker has edged ahead of Attorney General Martha Coakley in recent polling.\n\n\u201cEverything has to go well, and even if it does, it\u2019s going to be really close,\u201d said Mike Duhaime, an adviser to the Republican Governors Association. \u201cIn order to win in these kinds of states where you are so outnumbered, you need to win independents overwhelmingly, bring out your base, and get a good chunk of conservative to moderate Democrats.\u201d\n\nDuhaime helped create a blueprint for a Republican winning in a Democratic state as part of the team that steered Chris Christie to victory in New Jersey in 2009. But the adviser pointed out that the next year, while Republicans grabbed the governor\u2019s mansions in purple states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, they remained mostly shut out in deeply Democratic states, a record Republicans hope they can improve on this time around.\n\nOf the three states, Illinois seems most likely to elect a Republican in November. Unlike the challengers in Hawaii and Massachusetts, Rauner is a political neophyte and was a relative unknown when he began his campaign last year. Illinois Democrats sensed early on that Quinn was vulnerable. Attorney General Lisa Madigan made noises about running, and former White House chief of staff William Daley declared his candidacy before eventually dropping out over concerns that a costly primary would weaken the nominee.\n\nNow Quinn is taking some of the nation\u2019s lowest gubernatorial approval ratings into November in a state that has been governed by a Democrat since 2003, when the now convicted felon Rod Blagojevich was sworn into office.\n\n\u201cIn Illinois our situation is unique and isn\u2019t affected by national politics so much,\u201d said Pat Brady, a former chairman of the Illinois Republican Party. \u201cThis state is so screwed up, and it has been under iron-fisted control by the Democrats for the last 12 years. There is nothing good going on here.\u201d\n\nIllinois \u201cis so screwed up, and it has been under iron-fisted control by the Democrats for the last 12 years. There is nothing good going on here.\u201d\n\nIn Massachusetts, Baker is making his second bid for office after failing to unseat Gov. Deval Patrick in 2010. This time around, Bay State politicos say Baker, a health system CEO and former aide to Republican Gov. William Weld, has shed his wonky image in favor of soft-focus ads featuring his family, or the candidate high-fiving children and hugging small-business owners.\n\n\u201cI think Baker\u2019s chances are strong,\u201d said Conor Yunits, a Massachusetts-based Democratic consultant. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have much of a margin for error given the Democratic lean of the electorate, but he seems a better candidate than he was four years ago.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts has not hesitated to elect Republicans to statewide office in the past. Until Patrick came out of nowhere to win in 2006, Republicans had a hold on the governor\u2019s mansion that dated to the days of Mike Dukakis. The playbook Baker is using is not so different from the one his former boss Weld used when he won back in 1990: running up large margins among conservatives in the western part of the state and along the New Hampshire border, and raking in money from wealthy, Republican-leaning donors in the Boston suburbs.\n\nPlus, Baker is doing one thing the same as his counterparts in Illinois and Hawaii, and that Republicans on the coast must all do to some degree or another if they hope to be victorious: downplay social issues to the point where there is almost no difference between the Republicans and Democrats on issues like gay rights and reproductive health. If both candidates favor abortion rights and gay marriage, the thinking goes, even left-leaning independents will prefer to vote for the candidate who pledges to reduce their taxes.\n\n\u201cVoters are smart. They know what are state problems and what are state solutions, and what issues are federal issues,\u201d said Duhaime. \u201cAnd most of these social issues are addressed at the federal level.\u201d\n\nThe surprisingly close statehouse races come as ticket-splitting\u2014voting Republican for one office on your ballot, Democrat for another\u2014is at a 92-year low. And that is not just true in blue states, even if in 2014, when Obama faces a low ebb in his popularity, it remains more likely for a Republican to win in a Democratic state than vice versa.\n\nYet Democrats still could see gains in some of the nation\u2019s most unlikely territory. In Nebraska, Democrat Chuck Hassebrook is within striking distance of Republican Pete Ricketts. In Kansas, which has voted for a Republican for president since 1964, incumbent Republican Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s reelection bid is now rated a toss-up. In Alaska, which also has been straight Republican since the Johnson-Goldwater contest, incumbent Republican Gov. Sean Parnell finds himself in deep trouble now that the independent and Democratic candidates have merged their tickets.\n\nPolitical professionals say this momentary scattering of political allegiances reflects a larger frustration with Washington, D.C.-style politics and a belief that statehouses can remain laboratories of democracy. After all, if the party you keep voting into power does not deliver, why not try something else?\n\n\u201cPeople are just fed up,\u201d said Brady in Illinois. \u201cThey understand why these elections matter.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:50.018+0000"}

And it could make all the difference next November.\n\nIn a turn that was perhaps inevitable but nonetheless remarkable, Sarah Palin delivered a hyped-up speech (at Iowa's high-profile Freedom Summit) that drew disappointing reviews from within her own base of support.\n\nTo the surprise of no one, Palin's critics blew a gasket straining to capture the extent of their contempt for the warmed-over address. An apparent TelePrompTer malfunction -- the nightmare of pols ten times more polished and canny than Palin -- only added to their sense of gleeful horror.\n\nBut with her rambling rehash of familiar tropes and postures, Palin finally outlasted the patience and goodwill of her own core constituency -- the red-meat grassroots and the movement conservative media. Without any infrastructure, without any institutional platform, Palin could always count on her brand of performance art to put going rogue back in vogue. No longer.\n\nSmall-time soap opera, you say. End of an error. Actually, this is a big deal. Because the Palin phenomenon -- the popularity, the opportunism, the branding, and, yes, the politics -- all arose from a single source. Palin's importance wasn't as a new kind of conservative, ideologically speaking. It was as a new kind of politician.\n\nThere had never been a Republican or a Democrat with Palin's combination of personality, character, youthfulness, and very specifically gendered sort of sex. Even to the critics, she didn't come off as a pencil-necked weenie like Bobby Jindal or a sound-body-sound-mind orthogonian like Paul Ryan.\n\nBeing a woman helped. But, to borrow a line of analysis from critical theory, Palin wasn't gendered the same way as other political women, in any party. She was no granny in a pantsuit, like Elizabeth Dole or Hillary Clinton. She doesn't come off as fustily professional as Carly Fiorina or Meg Whitman. Palin's character type can never be a career politician because she's not even a career woman, in that stereotypical manner now apotheosized by Yahoo\u2019s Marissa Meyer.\n\nPalin's life experience mattered because it betokened the entry into politics of a new kind of woman -- equally into sports, guns, and kids. Palin's character type eventually appeared to exist everywhere across the vast red swath of the American interior. Conservatives have long understood in what complex way their youthful women could be masculine without losing the femininity. (Tocqueville bemusedly praised American ladies' \"manly virtue.\") The revolution was in a conservative woman mobilizing that naturally grown manner in the arena of national politics.\n\nHowever you choose to slice and dice gender identities, you must admit that Palin's success arose from her own \u2014 and that losing her appeal in spite of it, much like earning an F in English, took a lot of willpower to pull off.\n\nThe true heir to Palin's constituency will be a woman. How could it be otherwise?\n\nThe failure was on glaring display when the right-leaning Washington Examiner went in search of praise for Palin's prospects, but notable figures in the conservative mediasphere balked. Red-state stalwarts like HotAir's Ed Morrissey sighed that her speech \"wasn't well prepared\u201d; Gabriel Malor at Ace of Spades HQ said simply: \"She is done.\"\n\nVoices like these, once locked into mutual admiration with the rogue Republican who decried the \u201clamestream\u201d media, can't by themselves consign Palin to the political scrapheap. As they freely admit, however, the grassroots has \"generally moved on,\" too, in the words of Ben Domenech (whose website, The Federalist, I have written for).\n\nSo the essential question for 2016 is where, or whom, they'll move on to. The tea party ethos that Palin helped midwife may be protean and loosely organized, but it hasn't weakened much as a political force. This year's crop of presumptive Republican candidates offers the conservative base its strongest, broadest, and most credible choices ever. Domenech could plausibly suggest to the Examiner that contenders with an outsider appeal, such as Gov. Scott Walker Or Sen. Ted Cruz, were well positioned to attract and energize Palin's former constituency.\n\nBut character type is deeper, and it\u2019s prior to politics. The true heir to Palin's constituency will be a woman. How could it be otherwise?\n\nIt's a question not lost on the Republican elite, which is smart enough to know there is no real reason Palin's character type can't be brought into a more establishmentarian alignment. Enter Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst \u2014 servicewoman, heartland heroine, and the no-brainer choice to respond to the president's State of the Union on behalf of the whole Republican Party. Even a pig-castrating farm girl, you see, can find her way into the arms of such king- and queen-makers as Mitt Romney.\n\n\n\nTo her credit, Ernst possesses far more discipline than Palin, whose taste for guns did not extend into a longing for the military life. But if the whiff of the establishment gets too strong around her, the base will balk -- just ask Marco Rubio. And the jilted Palin constituency will be up for grabs again.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:50.567+0000"}

Horace Sheffield, a prominent Detroit minster whose daughter is on the city council, challenged hundreds of otherwise valid signatures gathered by the 24-term incumbent\u2019s campaign because the canvassers were not registered to vote in Michigan, as required by state law. One of those signature-gatherers not only turned to be unregistered but is also a fugitive from justice.\n\n\n\nAs of Friday, Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett, the election official responsible for determining the validity of ballot petitions for the campaign, said that of 1,000 signatures that Conyers needed to get on the ballot, only 592 passed muster of the 1,193 originally deemed to be valid. A final decision is due Tuesday and if this preliminary verdict holds, Conyers would be forced to run as a write-in. Needless to say, litigation is expected.\n\nFirst, the Conyers campaign is trying to rehabilitate signatures rejected for other reasons than the campaign worker who gathered them wasn\u2019t registered to vote. Conyers\u2019 attorney, John Pirish, is considered the top election lawyer in the state. Former Detroit mayor Dennis Archer raved to The Daily Beast about how Pirish successfully challenged tens of thousands of signatures gathered in an attempt to recall the then-mayor in late 1990s. According to Ed Sarpolus, a top Michigan pollster and Conyers\u2019 campaign manager in 2012, the campaign is confident that 700-800 previously rejected signatures can be rehabilitated and used to get Conyers back on the ballot.\n\nBut a winning write-in campaign isn\u2019t impossible, especially in Detroit. The Motor City\u2019s current mayor, Mike Duggan, won his primary after being booted off the ballot due to a technicality.\n\nEven if this effort to rehabilitate signatures is unsuccessful, there still is the prospect that those gathered by unregistered voters could be considered valid. Courts have rejected laws that mandate that those gathering petitions for ballot initiatives have to be registered voters, but have never tested the proposition for petitions for candidates to get on the ballot. However, this is considered less of a sure thing by Sarpolus because he notes that a judge may not allow it to apply retroactively.\n\nIf Conyers makes the ballot, he is expected to roll over Sheffield, who was arraigned in a domestic-violence case in February and has yet to file a fundraising report with the Federal Election Commission. The challenger\u2019s website is rudimentary and features a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with \u201cprofessional references.\u201d One of those references was former Mayor Archer, who is backing Conyers. Archer seemed a little surprised to be listed, telling The Daily Beast \u201cI find that to be sort of innocent and OK.\u201d The former mayor noted that Sheffield had run a neighborhood city hall during his administration and \u201cdid a very fine job and was very effective.\u201d\n\nThe question, though, is what happens if Conyers doesn\u2019t make the ballot.\n\nThings become a lot tougher if the incumbent has to run as a write-in. In that situation, \u201cSheffield doesn\u2019t have to be that formidable if [only] his name is on the ballot,\u201d according to Michigan political consultant Joe DiSano. He thought the 84-year-old Conyers would have to greatly ramp up his political operation and start raising a lot of money right away to run a successful write-in campaign.\n\nBut a winning write-in campaign isn\u2019t impossible, especially in Detroit. The Motor City\u2019s current mayor, Mike Duggan, won his primary after being booted off the ballot due to a technicality. Like Conyers, Duggan had been the frontrunner all along and was aided by a huge financial advantage. Sarpolus sees optimism in that result, telling The Daily Beast \u201cwrite-ins are only of consequence when people don\u2019t know who you are. If you educate the voters, make things clear, and they do it correct 90 percent of the time.\u201d\n\nDiSano was skeptical of the Duggan comparison, noting \u201cwhile there\u2019s a lot of respect for Conyers... he\u2019s not sure there\u2019s any residual feelings that congressman is being mistreated,\u201d as opposed to Duggan\u2019s campaign where many felt that Duggan was \u201cscrewed over.\u201d Archer also thought the Duggan analogy was imprecise. Instead, he compared Conyers\u2019 plight to that of former Washington, D.C. mayor Anthony Williams, who won a successful write-in campaign for reelection in 2002 after campaign issues kept him off the ballot. Archer, though, echoed Sapolus\u2019s analysis saying Conyers can win \u201cif he wants it and absolutely, I believe he wants it.\u201d\n\nConyers has faced competitive races in the recent past. In 2012, after redistricting, the incumbent faced ++a tough primary challenge, but in the words of DiSano \u201cthere was an all-hands-on-deck intervention to make sure he got over the hump.\u201d The congressman eventually won handily but one Democratic insider in Michigan noted that even if Conyers eventually makes the ballot, this fiasco has \u201cweakened him permanently\u201d in the future. The insider went on to point out for \u201cthe last few cycles people have thought about challenging him and now the game\u2019s on.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:50.825+0000"}

Hobby Lobby Stores: Religious freedom, contraception, and Obamacare\n\nPerhaps the most prominent of the Court\u2019s coming decisions is one that strikes at the heart of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s effort to set a minimum level of insurance coverage for Americans. Hobby Lobby is an arts and crafts chain owned by evangelical Christians who argue that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 allows them to deny health insurance coverage of contraceptives that they view as sinful.\n\nThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act states that the government should not \u201csubstantially burden\u201d a person who is exercising their religion unless it can be proved that a compelling government interest is at stake, and that the burden is the least restrictive way to fulfill that interest.\n\nThe Hobby Lobby owners have argued that emergency contraceptives are equivalent to an abortion, which they have religious objections to, while the government has argued that contraceptives such as Plan B are not medically considered pills that facilitate abortion.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on this case could have wide political implications, especially for the evangelical right\u2014could challenges to minimum wage laws, or even denial of services to gays and lesbians, be made on a religious basis, for example?\n\nMcCullen vs. Coakley: Buffer zones near abortion clinics\n\nIn another case that touches on the volatile issue of abortion, the Court could rule on the constitutionality of buffer zones around abortion clinics. A Massachusetts state law currently holds that individuals other than clinic staff may not \u201center and remain\u201d within 35 feet of a reproductive health care facilities.\n\nThe law, anti-abortion advocates argue, violates the First Amendment rights of \u201csidewalk counselors\u201d who are trying to dissuade women from ending their pregnancies. Pro-choice advocates, meanwhile, argue that the buffer zones are necessary for public safety.\n\nThe Court\u2019s ruling will be the latest in the long-running debate over the parameters that pro-choice and pro-life advocates must follow as they protest around health care facilities that provide abortion services, with implications not only for protesters but those seeking services.\n\nRiley vs. California: Police searches of smartphones\n\nThis case deals with a new legal question prompted by the proliferation of smartphones\u2014can the police search the smartphone of someone they\u2019ve arrested without a warrant, or does this violate the arrestee\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights?\n\nThe federal government and the state of California have argued that smartphones should be subject to searches just like a wallet is subject to search once someone is put under arrest. But a complicating matter is the large amount of personal information that individuals now keep on smartphones: from health records to appointments to their network of contacts.\n\nThe eventual ruling on this case may be a good indication of where the Supreme Court stands on issues relating to technology and privacy\u2014particularly relevant in an age of National Security Agency metadata collection.\n\nNLRB vs. Noel Canning: Presidential recess appointments\n\nThis case speaks to the breadth of presidential power over recess appointments. The dispute is over whether the President Obama\u2019s 2012 appointments to the National Labor Relations Board were constitutional. The president has the power to make appointments while the Senate is in recess, but Republicans were trying to limit the president\u2019s authority by holding pro forma sessions every few days.\n\nObama\u2019s decision to make appointments despite these pro forma sessions plays to a decades-long tug of war between the White House and Senate over who gets to determine when the Senate is actually in recess.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in this case could have repercussions on hundreds of NLRB cases decided since 2012\u2014if the president\u2019s appointments were invalid, then the decisions made by his appointees could be invalidated as well.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:51.653+0000"}

Instead of giving his imprimatur to one main super PAC, which is the norm, Cruz has four officially sanctioned super PACs: Keep the Promise PAC, Keep the Promise I, Keep the Promise II, and Keep the Promise III. National Review reported that this set-up is designed to give individual billionaires and their families maximal control over how their cash gets spent.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the rub. FEC filings show that those four PACs, combined, have taken in a healthy $39 million\u2014but only spent a teeny tiny little fraction of that on the senator\u2019s presidential efforts. And one of the PACs actually donated to one of Cruz\u2019s 2016 rivals.\n\nThis news comes as Cruz faces lackluster poll numbers and less than a week before the first GOP debate. RealClearPolitics\u2019 average gives him just 5.2 percent of the vote, lagging behind fellow conservative firebrands Rand Paul and Ben Carson. And a recent Fox News poll showed his support among likely Republican primary voters got cut in half since mid-March\u2014from 10 percent to just 4 percent.\n\nAnd while Cruz\u2019s PACs have kept their powder dry, other 2016 contenders\u2019 backers are spending big. The Conservative Solutions Project spent seven figures on TV ads touting Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s record on Iran, per the Tampa Bay Times. And, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer, the John Kasich-backing New Day for America has already spent $1.7 million blanketing New Hampshire televisions with ads touting the Ohio governor\u2019s record.\n\nCandidates who aren\u2019t running for president are getting similar boosts; Pat Toomey, a vulnerable Republican senator in Pennsylvania, is benefitting from a $1.5 million TV, direct mail, and digital video ad campaign from Concerned Veterans for America.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Cruz\u2019s own super PAC hedging against him before the first debate,\u201d said the Republican insider.\n\nBut Ted Cruz doesn\u2019t seem to be getting that kind of love. And in his home state, it\u2019s raised a few eyebrows.\n\n\u201cAre these people really planning to spend this money?\u201d queried one Texas Republican insider, adding that he thought the super PACs\u2019 gun-shy approach to spending was \u201cbizarre.\u201d\n\nSo while Cruz has made a host of positive headlines for the cash that his supporting super PACs have raked in, he doesn\u2019t actually seem to have benefitted much from their largesse.\n\nFirst off, there\u2019s Keep the Promise I, a PAC that gets the bulk of its cash from billionaire investor Robert Mercer. In this quarter of the year, the PAC took in more than $11 million and spent only $536,169.90. The kicker? Of that $536,169.90, a sweet five hundred grand went to a super PAC backing Carly Fiorina\u2014who, of course, is also running for president. Against Cruz.\n\nCNN, which first reported on Carly\u2019s PAC\u2019s money, called the contribution \u201cunusual,\u201d which is certainly a nice way to put it. Of the remaining $36,000 that the PAC spent, $20,000 went to a D.C.-based polling company. The remaining $16,169.90 went to Bracewell and Giuliani LLP for legal consulting. So from April through July of this year, the biggest benefactor of a putatively pro-Cruz super PAC was Carly Fiorina.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Cruz\u2019s own super PAC hedging against him before the first debate,\u201d said the Republican insider.\n\nThen there\u2019s Keep the Promise II\u2014funded solely by a $10 million donation from Toby Neugebauer, son of Rep. Randy Neugebauer\u2014and Keep the Promise III, funded by the fracking-enriched Wilks family. Those two PACs, combined, raised $25 million this quarter. Keep the Promise II didn\u2019t spend anything, and Keep the Promise III spent just $5,025.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the Keep the Promise PAC, which doesn\u2019t appear to be dominated by one major donor or donor family. It brought in a comparatively modest $1.8 million this quarter and spent about $97,000. Most of that went to covering legal fees, software, and media production. The PAC also spent $1,698.39 at an Austin Apple Store on a computer. This all means that while this PAC looks like it\u2019s been busier than the other three, it\u2019s still not doing a whole lot.\n\nCruz\u2019s atypical super PAC situation was designed to give donors more control over how their money got spent.

One\u2019s a socialist-hating billionaire and the other is a billionaire-hating socialist, right? Yet there they are, delivering boffo poll numbers long after everyone in the smart set had written them off as flashes in the pan.\n\nPerhaps, like Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, they\u2019re not so different after all. Indeed, the unanticipated appeal of Trump and Sanders to Republican and Democratic primary voters comes from the same psychological wellspring. They represent, in the words of Pittsburgh Tribune-Review columnist Salena Zito, \u201cpopulism born of frustration.\u201d They are angry candidates, bitching and moaning about the sorry shape of the United States and they are unabashedly protectionist. Each identifies immigrants and overseas competition as the root cause of most if not all of our problems. They both believe that if only we can wall off the country\u2014literally in The Donald\u2019s case and figuratively in Sanders\u2019\u2014we could \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d (as Trump puts it in his campaign slogan).\n\nTrump notoriously looks at Mexicans sneaking across the border and sees crime lords, drug dealers, and rapists, though he has magnamimously granted that \u201csome, I assume, are good people.\u201d Sanders, for his part, looks at the same hard cases and sees a reserve army of future wages slaves for the Koch brothers.\n\nIn an interview with Vox, Sanders was asked what he thought about increasing immigration in order to help poor foreigners increase their standard of living. \u201cThat\u2019s a Koch brothers proposal,\u201d he huffed, \u201cThat\u2019s a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States.\u201d So much for the internationalism and universal brotherhood on which socialism once prided itself.\n\n\n\nBeing anti-immigrant isn\u2019t a new position for Sanders. As Politico noted earlier this year, Sanders\u2019s loyalty to the AFL-CIO and other labor unions undergirds his consistent opposition to opening up borders and his contempt for free-trade agreements.\n\nIn regularly complaining about China, Sanders sounds just like\u2026Donald Trump. Riffing in post-industrial Michigan on August 11, Trump noted China\u2019s currency devaluation and announced, \u201cDevalue means, suck the blood out of the United States!\u201d\n\nFor good measure, Trump also attacked Sanders as a weakling even as he saluted him as a brother in spirit. Commenting on how the Vermont senator lost the microphone to a Black Lives Matter activist at a recent event in Seattle, Trump said, \u201cI felt badly for him, but it showed that he was weak. You know what? He\u2019s getting the biggest crowds, and we\u2019re getting the biggest crowds. We\u2019re the ones getting the crowds.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s most worrisome is that other candidates who are more likely to actually succeed in 2016 will try to win over Trump\u2019s or Sanders\u2019s supporters by co-opting their Fortress America mentality.\n\nIndeed, they are. Even after gracelessly implying Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly suffered from PMS during the first Republican candidates\u2019 debate, Trump leads among GOP voters with 23 percent and Sanders has \u201csurged\u201d ahead of Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire polls.\n\nDespite this, there\u2019s no chance either will win his party\u2019s nomination, much less become president. As Jack Shafer has noted, they are less candidates and more demagogues, who trade in \u201canger and resentment to attract supporters.\u201d Such intensity can get you a hard-core band of supporters\u2014just ask George Wallace or Ross Perot\u2014but it also ultimately limits the broad-based support necessary to pull enough votes even in hotly contested three-way elections.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say that Trump and Sanders haven\u2019t already had a major impact. In the early stages of the campaign, they are tapping into immense voter dissatisfaction with not just the Republican and Democratic Party establishments but a 21st-century status quo that is in many ways genuinely depressing and disappointing. Trump and Sanders offer seemingly authentic responses to and truly simplistic solutions for what ails us. Close the borders! Fuck the Chinese!\n\nWhat\u2019s most worrisome is that other candidates who are more likely to actually succeed in 2016 will try to win over Trump\u2019s or Sanders\u2019s supporters by co-opting their Fortress America mentality. All of the GOP contenders except Jeb Bush have called for some type of impenetrable border with Mexico as a precondition for discussing any changes in immigration numbers. By and large, they have also signed on to mandatory use of E-Verify, a national database that would effectively turn work into a government-granted privilege while increasing the reach of the surveillance state.\n\nThough she pushed for President Obama\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal while secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has flip-flopped and now is a critic of the deal. If Sanders continues to eat her lunch or even nibble around its edges through the end of the year, look for her to rethink her generally positive position on immigration too.\n\nTrump\u2019s and Sanders\u2019s appeal isn\u2019t hard to dope out.Twice as many of us\u201460 percent\u2014think the country is headed in the wrong direction as think it\u2019s going in the right direction. Trust in government has been skidding since the 1960s and the general loss of faith has accelerated since the 9/11 attacks. Trump and Sanders speak to our anxieties with a mix of shouty slogans, moral certitude, and magical policies on everything from health care to the minimum wage to ISIS.\n\nIn the current moment, it\u2019s the billionaire and the socialist who feel our pain. But if their Republican and Democratic opponents adopt their xenophobia and protectionist ideas, they will have helped increase our pain long after they\u2019ve inevitability sunk in the polls.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:52.425+0000"}

John Hickenlooper, who made those measures a centerpiece of his first term, backed swiftly away from them in a meeting with a group of county sheriffs.\n\nHickenlooper told the biennial meeting of the County Sheriffs of Colorado, who represent rural communities in the state and who vociferously opposed the measures, that he regrets signing the bills, and would not have done so had he known more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the funny story, and it is a weird\u2026 I think we screwed that up,\u201d Hickenlooper said, according to a videotape of the remarks that one sheriff in attendance posted online.\n\n\u201cSo we were performing legislation without basic facts, which I think is a bad idea in every case.

The bills also included increased background checks on gun purchases and a limit of sales to people convicted of domestic violence.\n\nMauser noted that the governor hailed the measures while signing them, and suggested that perhaps the governor was just playing to his audience. \u201cI am just confused,\u201d he said.\n\nTo the sheriffs, the governor expressed doubt that the high-capacity magazine ban could be enforced, and said that the only reason he pushed for it was because a staff member had said he would, and the governor then felt obligated.\n\nAt the time of the passage, Hickenlooper was hailed by gun-control activists, especially New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg\u2019s Mayors Against Illegal Guns group. Hickenlooper told the sheriffs, however, that Bloomberg had nothing to do with what happened in Colorado.\n\nConservative news outlets revealed this week that in fact phone logs from the governor\u2019s office showed that Hickenlooper had several conversations with the New York mayor.\n\nA spokesman for the governor clarified the governor\u2019s remarks to a Denver television station.\n\n\u201cThe governor often jokes about his ability to put his foot in his mouth, because he does,\u201d said Eric Brown, the spokesman. \u201cIt is well established that Gov. Hickenlooper spoke with Mayor Bloomberg, as well as NRA President [David] Keene and many other stakeholders in the gun-safety debate. In fact, the governor released phone records on this matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the governor told an audience of sheriffs that he had not talked to Bloomberg, the governor was attempting to convey he never had a conversation with Bloomberg that influenced the decision he made,\u201d Brown added. \u201cIn no way did the governor intend to mislead the sheriffs or anyone else.\u201d\n\nAfter the gun-control bills were signed into law last year, Colorado became ground zero for the fight over gun safety, with gun-rights activists pushing for the recall of two state lawmakers who supported the measures. Both lawmakers were defeated, despite a major infusion of resources from Bloomberg and other gun-control supporters.\n\nHickenlooper is up for reelection in 2014 in a state that remains deeply divided politically. Yet most political prognosticators do not think he is likely to lose this November.\n\nPerhaps for that reason, even some of Colorado\u2019s most ardent advocates for gun control were muted into their criticism of the governor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of it,\u201d said Tom Mauser, whose son, Daniel, was murdered in the Columbine High School shooting in 1999, and who has met with President Obama to push for more gun-safety laws. \u201cIt is certainly a very contentious issue. I think that for the average person they think there should be a right to bear arms, but they also understand that there should be limitations on guns. But in the political world, there is so much hand-wringing. It is tough to get things done.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the governor hailed the measures while signing them, and suggested that perhaps the governor was just playing to his audience. \u201cI am just confused,\u201d he said.\n\nEileen McCarron, the president of Ceasefire Colorado, the state\u2019s leading gun-control group, criticized the sheriffs for saying that they were not involved in the planning and drafting of the bills, but declined to criticize Hickenlooper for not standing behind his previous actions and words.\n\n\u201cThese comments were largely about process issues,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was a conversation between the governor and the sheriffs and we don\u2019t have a comment on it.\u201d\n\nThe National Rifle Association, meanwhile, seized on the comments as proof that Hickenlooper is tailoring his gun message to his audience, calling the remarks part of a \u201cdesperate tap dance.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy doing one thing as governor and then saying another on the campaign trail, Hickenlooper is clearly demonstrating that he has no credibility when it comes to protecting our Second Amendment freedoms,\u201d said Catherine Mortensen, spokesperson for the NRA.\n\nBut perhaps another errant remark by Hickenlooper recorded at the meeting sums up the whole imbroglio best.\n\n\u201cIf we had known that this was going to divide the state so intensely,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cI think we would have thought about it twice.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:53.734+0000"}
{"entityId": 1566, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Democrats are struggling to come up with a new name for their now-outdated Jefferson-Jackson Dinner.\n\nI can\u2019t understand why Democrats are so tied up in knots about what to name their big dinner. It\u2019s obvious what it should be called.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s review, starting with Messrs. Jackson and Jefferson. Okay, Andrew Jackson, that\u2019s an easy one. Genocide, Indian Removal Act, Trail of Tears, an ardor for slavery that was formidable even by the standards of the day. Nasty piece of work. True, he was a president, and he did beat the Brits in New Orleans, so sure, give him some kind of statue somewhere. But take him off the double sawbuck, and for God\u2019s sakes get his name off the annual dinner of the party that gets the lion\u2019s share of non-white people\u2019s votes.\n\nAs for Jefferson, I think that one is a lot more complicated. Yes, he was a slave owner. No one\u2019s defending that. But he was a genius and a Renaissance Man and the philosophical author of many of our best traditions, separation of church and state for starters. Also the rather crucial idea that there must be no test for citizenship save fealty to the Constitution. I would say that there\u2019s a lot more in the plus column than in the minus. But I understand that that particular minus looms large, as it should. There are many other ways to honor the upsides, so I guess if he has to go, he has to go.\n\nAll right then. So now we\u2019ve gone from the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, referred to euphoniously by the initiated as the J-J Dinner, to the _____-______ Dinner. Everybody seems intent in dumping the two old namesakes, but I don\u2019t see many people reaching much consensus on a new name. In Connecticut, they dumped the two J\u2019s but put off agreeing on a new name until this fall. Georgia Democrats appear to have done the same.\n\nWhat\u2019s so hard about this? The pool of potential options is ridiculously finite. I mean, it kind of has to be a president. So let\u2019s have a look at them, starting with the earliest post Jefferson-Jackson Democratic chief executives.\n\n1. Martin Van Buren. Right. That would be like the Yankees naming their annual dinner after Joe Pepitone.\n\n2. James K. Polk. It turns out that Polk gets pretty solid ratings from historians, often finishing in the Top 10. But he is fatally flawed according to the standards by which we\u2019re judging Jefferson and Jackson: He opposed the Wilmot Proviso, which sought to ban slavery in any of the territories \u201cacquired\u201d from Mexico\n\n3. Franklin Pierce. Disaster. The whole Kansas situation. However, I do read here that he lived to watch all three of his children die, including the third one\u2019s near-decapitation in a railway accident while Pierce was president-elect. Youch. That\u2019s hideous stuff, but it doesn\u2019t get you a dinner named after you.\n\n4. James Buchanan. Worse than Pierce, without the family tragedy (but an odd personal life, at once austere and rococo). No chance.\n\nIf Democrats insist on naming their dinner after someone who never did anything unsavory, they\u2019re going to have to go for Gandhi or Jesus.\n\n5. Andrew Johnson. Unfairly impeached, but nothing to write home about. And yet another Tennessean. What was up with that?\n\n6. Grover Cleveland. Hmmm, okay. He was for his day a rather courageous anti-imperialist, one of the few early presidents who didn\u2019t thirst to kill loads of high-melanin people. Very good on the Hawaii question. So that\u2019s something. More of a mixed bag domestically. Not bad as U.S. presidents go, but not dinner-worthy.\n\n7. Woodrow Wilson. Are you kidding? The presidency\u2019s biggest mega-racist. He makes Jefferson look like Joe Rauh. Next.\n\n8. Franklin Roosevelt. Ah. Now you\u2019re talking.\n\nOkay, I have an idea at this point. Now that we\u2019re into familiar territory, let\u2019s drop the chronology and the quick dismissals, because everyone from here on out has to be treated with some degree of seriousness. So let\u2019s sort through them.\n\nWe start with Jimmy Carter. Well, we wish him all the best in his fight with cancer. And we applaud so much of what he has done in more recent years. Do you know for example that the Carter Center is almost singlehandedly responsible for worldwide near-eradication of Guinea Worm Disease, an extremely painful condition that afflicted the world\u2019s poorest people? For that alone, Carter ought to be honored by 100,000 dinners.\n\nBut not, alas, the Democratic Party\u2019s annual dinner. The obvious reasons: One term, inflation, the hostage crisis. I bet you don\u2019t know that Carter was a world-class job creator, seriously. But it just wouldn\u2019t pass the laugh test, alas. History will be kind to him in a number of ways, but you can\u2019t call his a smashing presidency by any means.\n\nLBJ. Sigh. Such greatness domestically. But Vietnam. I believe that I have noticed this trend. Fifteen or so years ago, if you asked your average liberal to put a \u201cdomestic achievements\u201d weight on one side of the LBJ scale and a \u201cVietnam\u201d weight on the other side, s/he would have gone about 30-70. I sense that now this liberal would go maybe 45-55. So he\u2019s getting there, but he\u2019s not ready for dinner time.\n\nJack. Jack\u2019s reputation has gone down, hasn\u2019t it? The women, the pills (albeit for a really painful back). Where Johnson has gone up in the historical revisionism sweepstakes, Kennedy has taken a bit of a tumble. Still, the Camelot thing retains a certain talismanic power for Democrats. So, JFK is a contender.\n\nHarry Truman. There\u2019s a lot to like here. No one should have many issues with his domestic agenda, which was robustly populist. And I\u2019m a fan of his foreign policy and wrote about a jillion columns over the last decade explaining why the neocons had misappropriated him. He never would have done something like invade Iraq. Okay, there\u2019s Fat Man and Little Boy to think about, but I would say that he was looking at maybe another full year of war and deaths of how many American soldiers before Japan finally surrendered. Just about anyone sitting in the Oval Office would have dropped them.\n\nAnyway, we can\u2019t go combing through the details of these people\u2019s records looking for excuses to exclude them. That\u2019s just historically unfair. Basically, Truman represents decent Democratic and American values. I also like the fact, and maybe this is just me, that he came from humble roots and was such a voracious autodidact.\n\nThe Bill Clinton case is muddied not by Monica or any of that nonsense but by the fact that it\u2019s too early, especially given the possibility that his wife might be president for the next four or eight years. That would just be tacky, a President Clinton presiding over Clinton Day dinners. Actually something worse than tacky. But he was a fine president in many of the most important ways, and maybe someday it\u2019ll make sense, especially if Hillary also becomes POTUS.\n\nIf it\u2019s too early for Clinton, it\u2019s definitely too early for Barack Obama. Although\u2026the idea of the Truman-Obama Dinner does have something going for it. That would take some stones. It\u2019d make Republicans crazy. And it would connect older Democratic traditions (the days when the Democrats were unequivocally the party of \u201cthe working man\u201d) with the newer ones. It isn\u2019t nuts.\n\nBut ultimately, and I guess predictably, I vote for the FDR Dinner. First of all, you don\u2019t need two people. The Republicans have a Lincoln Day Dinner. One person is fine. And come on\u2014he\u2019s Franklin Roosevelt. Depression. Fascism. I mean, look at this. In survey after survey after survey, the top three presidents are Washington, Lincoln, and Frank. This is just as no-brainer as a no-brainer gets. Yes, he played ball with the Dixiecrats, and yes, there was the Japanese internment. But if Democrats insist on naming their dinner after someone who never did anything unsavory, they\u2019re going to have to go for Gandhi or Jesus.\n\nThis should need all of five minutes\u2019 debate at state Democratic committees. But watch, this\u2019ll drag out three years in some places. What I bet a lot of them will do is leave it up to each state to choose some local hero. In my home state, I doubt they\u2019d be able to avoid calling it the Robert Byrd Dinner.

{"entityId": 1567, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Democrats still think that 2016 is going to be Clinton cakewalk. But unless they wake up to economic reality, they may be in for a shock.\n\nLast Tuesday America rendered its verdict on the Obama presidency, and on Wednesday Barack Obama let the world know that he really didn\u2019t care. The Democrats drowned in a Sea of Red, but that simply provoked the President\u2019s detached defiance. His post-mortem that there is no red or blue America was tired and flat-out wrong. The reality is that America is divided along multiple fault lines, and that Obama has played on and profited from these fissures, even as he now pretends they don\u2019t exist.\n\nIf the Democrats maintain this charade, 2016 will not be the cakewalk they dream it to be. Harping about a Republican war on women while wages stagnate and growth sputters is trivial and desperate. It cost Mark Udall his Senate seat in Colorado and, in Texas, Wendy Davis didn\u2019t even come close, losing by over 900,000 votes in her failed bid to become governor. There\u2019s no reason to believe that same message won\u2019t trigger a similar backlash two years from now. Earth to Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC: dyspeptic dad still votes.\n\nThe Democrats have taken identity politics a step too far. Somehow, their message has gone from lunch-bucket concerns to a date with Girls. In the face of record low workforce participation, the Democrats have paid a high price for making the unholy trinity of Lena Dunham, Al Sharpton, and billionaire climate-change crusader Tom Steyer the face of their party.\n\nAccording to the exit polls, 60 percent of white working-class voters went Republican, the same as in 2010, while a record 64 percent of white men did the same. Sometimes, jobs and paychecks come out ahead of self-actualization.\n\nMusing about green jobs will not be enough, and if the Democrats succumb to the whims of their donor base, Election night 2016 may be a repeat of 2014.\n\nStill, it wasn\u2019t just the usual suspects who were turned off by the Democrats slicing and dicing the electorate. Core Democratic constituencies also had enough of what the President was selling. In a marked reversal from past elections, a majority of Asian-Americans went Republican, as did a third of Latino voters. But it was more than simply ethnic blocs; it was also about deep blue states saying please don\u2019t tell us that what you\u2019ve put on our plates is chicken salad.\n\nReliably Democratic Maryland and Massachusetts elected Republicans as governors. In Illinois, the President\u2019s home state, voters sent the Democratic incumbent governor packing, in the same spirit in which Illinois had previously tapped Mark Kirk, a Republican and a Navy Reservist, to fill Obama\u2019s Senate seat. Meanwhile in the Empire State, New Yorkers put the GOP in control of the state senate, and also painted three blue congressional districts red. Even Vermont\u2019s Democratic governor is going to have to have his neck saved by the state legislature. To be sure, the election was not an embrace of the GOP platform, but it was a wholesale rejection of Barack Obama.\n\nClearly, the Republicans learned something from 2010 and 2012. The GOP finally internalized that running statewide is not the same thing as running for Congress but with more money and a louder megaphone. Rather, it\u2019s about speaking to a larger population with varied concerns, and that nuance mattered.\n\nThat lesson paid huge dividends for the GOP. Gone were the likes of Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock, and Christine O\u2019Donnell. In the Mississippi Senate primary, the GOP resisted the suicidal siren song of neo-Confederate Chris McDaniel, and backed incumbent Senator Thad Cochran. Normalcy and reality were keystones of the Republican agenda.\n\nThe Republicans also made huge strides in cutting their technology and get-out-the-vote deficit, beating the Democrats at their own game. In politics as in war, winning techniques do not stay secret for long. Normally Democratic Silicon Valley opened up its wallets to the Republicans this time out. As The Wall Street Journal reported, \u201cIn 2010 Democratic candidates for national office got 55% of contributions from tech-company political-action committees. This year Republicans have received 52%.\u201d\n\n\n\nCampaign finance records reflect that Google\u2019s PAC donated $30,000 to each the Republican Senatorial Committee and to the National Republican Congressional Committee. And that\u2019s no small thing.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Eric Schmidt had been an active ally in Obama\u2019s tech wars, giving the Obama campaign aid and advice in the president\u2019s reelection bid. Schmidt has even become business partners with Jim Messina, Obama\u2019s former campaign head and deputy chief of staff, who has since signed on with Team Clinton. Apparently, tech world is no longer enthralled by the promise that was Obama.\n\nHeading into 2016, the Democrats will start out with a real but not insurmountable advantage, with a hammerlock on the West Coast, New England, and New York. But beyond that, they too will have to fight for votes in places like Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, North Carolina, and Virginia \u2013 states they either lost or almost lost on Election Day.\n\nTo do it, the Democrats will need to win enough votes from the white working class. Without Obama on the ballot, minority turnout can be expected to decline from its 2008 and 2012 peaks. To make inroads with what once the Democrats\u2019 base \u2013 Northern ethnics and Southern whites \u2013 FDR\u2019s nominal heirs will have to talk about real jobs, growth, and energy, as well as relent on Keystone XL. Musing about green jobs will not be enough, and if the Democrats succumb to the whims of their donor base, Election night 2016 may be a repeat of 2014.\n\nAs was expected, the Clintons are already up and running. The day after the Democrats\u2019 debacle, e-solicitations went out telling folks to get ready for Hillary. Yes, the game is on regardless of what anyone may say. But touting another avatar presidency may not be enough. The Democrats will have to pay homage to the forgotten man.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:54.800+0000"}

But he connects with the heart of the Republican Party.\n\nThe GOP sowed the wind, and Donald Trump is reaping the whirlwind. Much to the horror of the Republican Establishment, Trump has a message that connects with the party\u2019s base, and makes no bones about it. With his in-your-face style, Trump is simply saying what the Republican rank-and-file think. Period, full stop.\n\nObama\u2019s wasn\u2019t born here, check. And, of course, a hard line on immigration.\n\n\u201cI love the Mexican people \u2026 I respect Mexico \u2026 but the problem we have is that their leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders, and they\u2019re killing us at the border,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re taking our jobs. They\u2019re taking our manufacturing jobs. They\u2019re taking our money. They\u2019re killing us.\u201d\n\nTrump was also late in calling for South Carolina to shelve the Confederate Flag, which is no surprise. A whopping 78 percent of Republicans still view the flag as a legitimate form of Southern pride, and two-thirds say it\u2019s OK for states to fly it.\n\nLike him or not, The Donald is one of the few Republicans to internalize the facts that the white working- and middle class are the heart of the Republican Party, and that older Americans now trend Republican. He connects, unlike Mitt Romney, who in 2012 craved the votes of white non-college graduates, but could not break through.\n\nBut Trump is not Mitt. On Saturday, at the Phoenix Convention Center, Trump drew a crowd of 4,000 to hear him denounce illegal immigration in raw terms, with lines forming before sunrise.\n\nAccording to Trump, \u201cThe word is getting out that we have to stop illegal immigration. \u2026We have a situation that is absolutely out of control. \u2026 We\u2019re getting taken apart piece-by-piece slowly.\u201d\n\nFor good measure, Trump even invoked the ghost of Richard Nixon by announcing as he left the stage, \u201cThe silent majority is back, and we\u2019re going to take our country back.\u201d\n\nAhead of the event Trump was described by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake as \u201ccoarse, ill-informed and inaccurate,\u201d and by McCain as \u201coffensive.\u201d\n\nTrump also introduced Jamiel Shaw to the audience, whose son was shot and killed by an illegal immigrant. Shaw painted a grim and vivid picture: \u201cThink about your child laying in the street dead. \u2026 We were not designed for that.\u201d Harsh words for sure, but less clumsy than a mid-debate plea for \u201cself-deportation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking our jobs. They\u2019re taking our manufacturing jobs. They\u2019re taking our money. They\u2019re killing us.\u201d\n\nThe P.T. Barnum of this election cycle, Trump understands that politics is transactional, and that the electorate must be offered something in return for their votes. By contrast, almost everyone else in the Republican field seems fixated on the donor base, broadening the GOP at the expense of its core, or talking about faith, even as they would pickpocket the voters of what is theirs.\n\nUnlike Trump, the rest of the presidential hopefuls parade around with outstretched arms and upturned palms, echoing their patrons\u2019 sentiments. Bush, Cruz, Rubio, Christie, and Walker have each called for seniors to take a hit for the greater good of America\u2019s bondholders, but hey, at least they love God, and will let you know.\n\nWith apologies to the Good Book, man can\u2019t live on faith alone, and Trump understands at least that much. Rather, he\u2019s taking the \u201cyou paid for it, it\u2019s yours\u201d approach to older Americans.\n\nSpeaking to CPAC back in 2013 Trump declared, \u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable for people who paid into a system for decades to expect to get their money\u2019s worth\u2014that\u2019s not an \u2018entitlement,\u2019 that\u2019s honoring a deal.\u201d Trump sounds like someone in touch with reality, or at least like someone who wants to win.\n\nIn the face of this Trumpmentum, the party\u2019s establishment is powerless\u2014unable to admit that Trump is in sync with GOP voters, so they say simply that Trump is \u201cbad.\u201d They risk coming off as tone-deaf or, worse, mean.\n\nFor example, over at The New York Times, Peter Wehner, a Bush 43 White House alum, took Trump to task for sticking up for the elderly. According to Wehner, Trump committed the unpardonable sin of accusing Republican contenders of \u201c\u2018attacking\u2019 Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThis nod toward the social safety net (and political realism) led Wehner to ask, somewhat peevishly, \u201cWhy would conservatives find him the least bit appealing?\u201d\n\nFor starters, it might have to do with Republicans being older. That\u2019s a fact, plain and simple. In the last presidential election, Republicans won among voters 45 and up. Seniors haven\u2019t voted Democratic since 1992. And while Wehner may have forgotten that George W. Bush\u2019s call for Social Security privatization preceded the 2008 stock market crash and Great Recession, older voters haven\u2019t.\n\nNo, Trump\u2019s rants will not help the Republicans come November 2016. But Trump\u2019s stance is doing wonders for him in the here and now. According the latest Economist/Yougov Poll, Trump leads the GOP pack, and for the first time is viewed favorably by a plurality of the party faithful.\n\nAnd no, Trump almost certainly won\u2019t win the nomination, but Republicans are rightfully concerned that today\u2019s rhetoric will haunt them a year from now. America\u2019s changing demographics further weigh against them, so simply beating up on Trump will leave the challenges posed by his candidacy unanswered. Resistance to immigration is not just about culture or ethnicity (although they are certainly factors), it\u2019s also about economics, something Trump with his bar-stool political rhetoric understands.\n\nProspective Republican nominees must be able to say how they will re-ignite 3 percent-plus growth, while spurring wages upward. (For the record, since 2006 annual GDP growth has been below 3 percent. The 4 percent growth promised by Jeb was last seen in 2000, the final year of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency.)\n\nMeanwhile, employee compensation as a percentage of GDP remains near an all-time low. Working-class Americans understand this in their gut and feel it in their wallet, so they can\u2019t be blamed for thinking that liberalized immigration helps no one but illegal immigrants, their families, and employers across the board. Those are not only Trump\u2019s people; they\u2019re the Republican base.\n\nSo while Trump\u2019s take is tart, he has a hit a nerve in this prolonged era of economic insecurity and froth. Labeling Trump a villain, or calling on Americans to labor for longer hours misses the mark. Rather, getting out from Trump\u2019s shadow will require the Republican nominee to make America\u2019s workers an offer they won\u2019t want to refuse. As Trump would say, it\u2019s all part of \u201cthe art of the deal.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:55.065+0000"}

The U.S. Central Command analysts filed a complaint in July.\n\nFeinstein said the Defense IG probe could take up to a year, which she believed was too long.\n\n\u201cWe need our intelligence analysts to feel comfortable playing it straight. We\u2019ve had, obviously, issues with faulty intelligence in the past and it\u2019s just important that our decision makers to have good information.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to reach the chairman to see if he and I could sit down with this individual,\u201d Feinstein said, referring to a whistleblower who has met with the committee\u2019s staff. \u201cThis whistleblower, as far as I\u2019ve been told, seems credible.\u201d\n\nSen. Richard Burr, the committee\u2019s chairman, said he was content to allow the Pentagon investigation to play out, and that no congressional action should occur until a report is finished. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to let the IG work through it, because it has been referred to him,\u201d Burr said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a [ISIS] status meeting in Armed Services next week, and I\u2019m going to be asking about it,\u201d added Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine.\n\n\u201cThe politicization of intelligence products would be a major issue, and these allegations need to be thoroughly investigated. The Intelligence Committee will take all appropriate action to ensure our nation\u2019s policymakers receive unbiased analysis from the Intelligence Community,\u201d said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes in a statement.\n\nAdded his Democratic counterpart, ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, \u201cwe do take seriously any allegations of the mishandling or manipulation of intelligence information for purposes other than getting to ground truth. In the wake of the flawed intelligence prior to the Iraq War, we must make sure that all voices are appropriately considered and that assessments are never again politicized.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s deeply troubling and it needs to be investigated,\u201d Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte said. \u201cWe need our intelligence analysts to feel comfortable playing it straight. We\u2019ve had, obviously, issues with faulty intelligence in the past and it\u2019s just important that our decision makers to have good information.\u201d\n\nThe allegations of intelligence manipulation could have far-reaching consequences. Already, one senator is using the so-called CENTCOM intelligence \u201crevolt\u201d to push for a vote explicitly authorizing\u2014or withholding\u2014military operations against the so-called Islamic State.\n\nSen. Kaine, who is a leading proponent of passing a new authorization for the use of military force, says the allegations of intelligence manipulation, if proven true, underscore the need for such a vote.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see why we need to do an authorization for this war? It\u2019s spreading, it\u2019s mutating. There\u2019s new theaters of war that are engaged,\u201d Kaine told The Daily Beast. \u201cIf what [the whistleblowers are] saying is right, they\u2019re saying that it\u2019s a more complicated, protracted, long-term war than maybe people were led to think. If that\u2019s the case, we ought to be doing an authorization.\u201d\n\nReports on allegations of cooked intelligence and sanitized reports had reverberations elsewhere throughout Washington on Thursday. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter reminded military leaders that they should give their candid assessment of the U.S. war effort.\n\nPentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook told reporters that Carter ordered Marcel Lettre, the acting Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, to remind top defense intelligence officials they should provide their \u201cunvarnished, transparent intelligence\u201d because that \u201cis what the secretary expects on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nAnd Gen. Vincent Stewart, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was asked about The Daily Beast\u2019s report and the IG investigation by Fox News\u2019 Catherine Herridge, who was moderating a panel of intelligence agency directors in Washington. Analysts for the DIA working at U.S. Central Command were among those who lodged complaints.\n\nStewart declined to comment on the investigation, which he said continues. But in general, he said, \u201cWe take great pride in the idea of speaking truth to power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe pride ourselves on our analytic rigor,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cIt is not clean, it is not science.\u201d\n\nHe concluded by saying, \u201cThe investigation will play itself out\u201d and determine \u201cif we did anything wrong.\u201d\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by Nancy A.

Incumbent Senator Pat Roberts, who\u2019s been in Washington for more than 20 years, has to convince voters he\u2019s not out of touch, that he\u2019s still a real Kansan, while Greg Orman, a newcomer running as an Independent, has to convince voters he\u2019s not a closet Democrat but a real middle-of-the-roader.\n\nEach man\u2019s strategy for victory is evident in the new campaign staffs hastily assembled after Democrat Chad Taylor withdrew from the race and polls showed Roberts trailing Orman in a one-on-one matchup. With majority control of the Senate at stake, the GOP dispatched a team out of Washington to rescue Roberts while Orman went on a hiring spree. He brought in three Democrats (pollster David Beattie, adman Eric Adelstein, and spokesman Mike Phillips), but he also hired two Republicans, campaign manager Jim Jonas, whose GOP roots stretch back to the legendary Roger Ailes and the Bush-Quayle campaign of 1992, and spokesman Sam Edelen, who has worked for Republican mayoral and gubernatorial candidates.\n\n\u201cSmart,\u201d says Third Way co-founder Matt Bennett, \u201cbecause he\u2019s running as a real Independent, and he\u2019s made it clear he isn\u2019t going to identify with one party or the other until after the election.\u201d Bennett, a moderate Democrat, would like to see Orman caucus with the Democrats should he win, but if the GOP gains control of the Senate, which seems more likely than not, Orman might well decide to align with the majority party to have more impact. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be terrible to have a moderate voice inside the Republican caucus,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cEither way, it\u2019s good for Kansans and for the country.\u201d\n\nThe two Republicans helping Orman do so at considerable risk to themselves. \u201cIf you\u2019re taking on a sitting Republican senator who has everyone from Bob Dole to Sarah Palin coming in to campaign for him, you\u2019re going to cross a Rubicon, and that takes some guts for a Republican,\u201d says Bennett. Jonas, who is based in Denver, has dabbled in third-party politics before as a co-founder of Unity \u201908, which never got off the ground in 2008, and Americans Elect, which fell short in its attempt to nominate a centrist ticket in 2012.\n\nThose efforts were such long shots they didn\u2019t invite the kind of vitriol that is likely to come Jonas\u2019 way if he is seen as hurting GOP chances to take the Senate. \u201cMitch McConnell keeps score, especially after the majority is on the line or could be,\u201d says Jack Pitney, a government professor at Claremont McKenna College in California. \u201cIf the Republicans end up with exactly 50 seats (picking up five instead of the six they need for control), does he caucus with the Democrats or the Republicans? That gives him very plausible leverage.\u201d\n\nThe newly installed campaign team charged with revving up Roberts\u2019 response to this unexpectedly strong challenge is led by Chris LaCivita, a longtime top operative for Republicans who is best known for advising the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth in 2004. A practitioner of scorched-earth politics, he is presumed responsible for turning the normally mild-mannered Roberts into an attack dog of the first order. Roberts has gone from waging a rather sleepy campaign to running around the state calling President Obama a \u201cnational socialist,\u201d a derogatory phrase that Roberts apparently didn\u2019t realize is derived from Nazi, or National Socialist Democratic Workers Party. The goal is to nationalize the race around Obama, whose approval rating in Kansas is just 33 percent.\n\n\n\n\u201cTalking about national socialism and bringing in Sarah Palin might not be the best move for a Republican in a state that\u2019s decided their governor has gone too far,\u201d says a centrist Democrat.\n\nComplicating matters for Roberts, he has the misfortune of running on the same ballot as Governor Sam Brownback, who\u2019s behind his Democratic challenger in his bid for reelection. Brownback enacted radical tax cuts and spending cuts, which his critics charge sent the state into a slump and left public schools without resources. \u201cTalking about national socialism and bringing in Sarah Palin might not be the best move for a Republican in a state that\u2019s decided their governor has gone too far,\u201d says Bennett.\n\nProving his far-right bona fides is just one aspect of the newly energized Roberts campaign. The other aspect, which is where LaCivita excels, is the negative attack launched against Orman for his friendship with Rajat Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs board member who is serving time for insider trading. Orman was on the witness list for the defense in the 2012 trial, but was never called. \u201cWhere there\u2019s any smoke you can claim fire,\u201d says Sam Popkin, a political scientist who teaches at the University of California San Diego and whose most recent book is The Candidate.\n\nWhether the charge will work to sufficiently taint Orman is another issue, says Popkin. Orman should be able to deflect the attack, using Gupta\u2019s imprisonment to show that Wall Street gets punished. There\u2019s no suggestion Orman is guilty of anything except refusing to throw Gupta under the bus. If the worst they can say is this is a guy who doesn\u2019t abandon friends when they go to jail, that\u2019s survivable, says Popkin, who notes: \u201cServing on boards and knowing an insider trader makes you almost like a Republican.\u201d\n\nRoberts\u2019 campaign promises more attacks from its opposition research, which will test Orman and his team. That\u2019s to be expected given the national importance of this race, and what it might portend about the future of politics if a well-regarded incumbent is tossed out for a man without a party. \u201cIf he ever stole anybody\u2019s lunch money in kindergarten, that\u2019s going to come out,\u201d says Claremont McKenna\u2019s Pitney. One side is playing conventional hardball, the other is looking for the promised land, and with four weeks to go, who these consultants are and the path they prescribe will define this race as much as the candidates.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:55.482+0000"}

That tour, with its dedicated advance team, carefully stage-managed press availability, and multi-city itinerary, has all the hallmarks of a testing of the waters for a possible presidential run.

And such a candidate could suck up oxygen from Clinton as she tries to focus on the Republican Party, which will be hungry for the White House after eight years in the wilderness.\n\nSanders has called for a minimum wage above the $10.10 that Obama has proposed, further investment in the nation\u2019s infrastructure, higher taxes on corporation and the wealth and a carbon tax.\n\n\u201cIf [Clinton] does run, will she be as strong as the times require in taking on the billionaire class that has so much power?

{"entityId": 1572, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "When the Obama administration was looking to pull American troops from Iraq, the then-secretary of state was a force pushing for troops to stay. Did she make the right call?\n\nHillary Clinton today portrays her stance on Iraq as being the same as President Obama\u2019s. But when she was Secretary of State, she pushed hard for keeping troops in Iraq\u2014despite the fact that the White House was looking to bring all the troops home.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton was a lion for keeping troops there,\u201d James Jeffrey, who was the U.S. ambassador to Iraq in 2011, told The Daily Beast in an interview. \u201cShe was a strong advocate for keeping troops there past 2011,\u201d when American forces eventually withdrew.\n\nAt a CNN Town Hall on Tuesday, Clinton unveiled what is now her official accounting of what happened in 2011, when the Obama administration was negotiating to keep troops in Iraq with the government of Nouri al-Maliki. Clinton placed the blame for the failure of the negotiations on Maliki. She said the administration had offered him a Status of Forces Agreement with American troops attached, but he didn\u2019t accept.\n\n\u201cI was involved in a lot of the efforts to come up with what our offer would be,\u201d she said, pointing to the need to have immunity for any remaining U.S. troops. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get that done. And I think, in retrospect, that was a mistake by the Iraqi government.\u201d\n\nBut at the time of the negotiations, Clinton\u2019s State Department and the Obama White House were not on the same page. The vast majority of the senior White House national security team, including Obama himself, saw ending the Iraq war as a key campaign promise, a way to right a Bush administration wrong, and as a bow to the will of the American people.\n\nFor Clinton, her State Department senior staff\u2014as well as for top officials at the time, including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and CIA Director David Petraeus\u2014there was a national security interest in keeping thousands of troops in Iraq. There were limited, but important, missions to be done: countering terrorists, advising the Iraqi armed forces, and protecting U.S. personnel. Clinton was particularly aggressive in pushing for a long-term troop presence, officials involved in the negotiations say.\n\nOf course, Clinton has always been more hawkish on Iraq than Obama. She voted to authorize the war, only later to say she believed that vote was made based on bad intelligence. In his recent autobiography, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates revealed that Clinton admitted to opposing the 2007 surge in Iraq against her beliefs because she was preparing to run in a presidential primary against Obama.\n\nThe White House, on the other hand, celebrated the demise of the SOFA negotiations and called Iraq a mission accomplished.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton was a lion for keeping troops there. She was a strong advocate for keeping troops there past 2011.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we were looking for was an Iraq that was secure, stable, and self-reliant, and that\u2019s what we got here, so there\u2019s no question that was a success,\u201d said then-Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough, now White House chief of staff, in October 2011, on the day the complete withdrawal was announced.\n\n\u201cThe White House has always seen the president\u2019s pledge to get all troops out of Iraq as a core commitment, period,\u201d a White House official told me at the time.\n\nThroughout those excruciating months-long negotiations with the Maliki government, the biggest and ultimately fatal sticking point was the Americans\u2019 demanding that immunity protections for U.S. forces be ratified by the Iraq Council of Representatives. The problem was the council was an unpredictable and unreliable body that was unlikely to endorse a continued American troop presence, which would be broadly unpopular among their constituents.\n\nGOP senators including John McCain believe that the White House injected that condition as a poison pill because they did not want the negotiations to succeed. But Clinton, who did want the negotiations to succeed, also believed that the immunity guarantee needed to be signed by the COR, not just left to the Maliki government.\n\n\u201cNobody [in the senior ranks of the administration] thought it was a good idea to try to get a SOFA based solely on a piece of paper from Mr. Maliki,\u201d said Jeffrey, who led the negotiations with Iraq for the U.S. government along with Gen. Lloyd Austin, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq at the time, and Brett McGurk, a White House official who was once in consideration to replace Jeffrey as America\u2019s envoy to Baghdad.\n\n\u201cThe truth about Hillary is that she is staunchly anti-Maliki. She thinks he\u2019s an old-school sectarian thug,\u201d a former senior Obama administration official added.\n\nIn the end, most officials who were directly involved blame the bureaucratic processes and domestic politics in both Baghdad and Washington for wasting precious months, making a deal by the end of 2011 unattainable.\n\n\u201cThere was major frustration among folks like Austin and Jeffrey because they were the ones on the ground and they wanted to get this done. They wanted a residual force because they thought it was important,\u201d a former senior official said. \u201cAt the end of the day, those debates were basically moot because Maliki made it impossible.\u201d\n\nIf she runs for president, Clinton will have several questions to answer about her stewardship of the Iraq portfolio. The State Department led a reconstruction program that squandered billions of American taxpayer dollars on misguided and poorly implemented projects. The U.S. Embassy and its support staff grew to gargantuan proportions, only to be \u201cright-sized\u201d later on. U.S. consulates were built and then abandoned. State Department training of the Iraqi police forces was a disaster.\n\nBut the main question Clinton does not answer in her book and has not directly addressed yet is, if she had been successful in her drive to keep American troops in Iraq, would that have made the difference? The White House didn\u2019t believe it would.\n\nFor the White House, \u201cThe question at the time was, how will a residual troop presence reduce sectarianism or make Maliki create a more inclusive government, and there wasn\u2019t good evidence to support that,\u201d said former National Security Council spokesperson Tommy Vietor.\n\nAs ISIS advances on Baghdad, the evidence is now piling up that the U.S. military mission to train the Iraqi army and fight terrorism was not complete. Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey testified to Congress on Wednesday that he, too, believed the U.S. should have worked harder to keep troops in Iraq past 2011 and still believes that\u2019s the right policy.\n\n\u201cIt is our duty to help counter the threat of ISIS,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do have aspirations to attack Western interests\u2026 It makes sense that they will be a threat to the homeland, in time.\u201d\n\nThe office of Hillary Clinton declined to comment for this story.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:55.956+0000"}
{"entityId": 1573, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The man that led the Kentucky senator to Washington could prevent him from entering the White House.\n\nJust a few months into his campaign for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate in 2009, Kentucky\u2019s Rand Paul was interviewed by Alex Jones, a noted conspiracy theorist who spreads his message on his syndicated radio show and on his website, Infowars.com. Jones is a moon landing denier who believes the government acted as a guiding hand for the September 11 attacks and the Oklahoma City bombing, buys into the New World Order\u2014the theory that a group of so-called elites are conspiring to form a singular, totalitarian global government\u2014has accused American pop stars of being purveyors of Illuminati mind control\u2014and that\u2019s not even the half of it. Paul, his eyes wide, offered, \u201cI think it\u2019s a little scary in our country that we\u2019re doing what's called \u2018political profiling.\u2019 People are worried about profiling people for the color of their skin. Now we\u2019re profiling people for the color of their thought.\u201d For any candidate laboring to gain admittance to America\u2019s most exclusive club, the interview would have seemed an unlikely pit stop\u2014but Rand Paul was not just any candidate.\n\nJones has recalled encountering Paul for the first time nearly two decades ago, when he heard him on Republic Radio, with personality Mark \u201cMark from Michigan\u201d Koernke, another conspiracy theorist and part of the militia movement in the 1990s. Paul was on the air, Jones remembered, speaking on behalf of Ron Paul, his father, who was running a tough campaign for reelection to Congress in Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s just weird how time flies. [Rand will] probably end up being president if we\u2019re able to turn this country around. He\u2019s got a real shot at it, except for the electronic voting machine fraud. I can read the tea leaves as anyone can,\u201d Jones told his listeners.\n\nJones was right\u2014about the tea leaves. Paul has secured his status as the early frontrunner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. He is being baited daily to say, definitively, that he is running. The younger Paul is the successor to the Ron Paul throne. He inherited his fans, his donors, his staff, and his friends in the media. But to continue on the path to the nomination that he is on, he will have to prove that he is mainstream enough to win\u2014which will mean, in part, emancipating himself from the very person who gave him literal and\u2014not so long ago\u2014political life, and from the fringe allies, like Jones, he was handed.\n\nAll the while, his father continues to make headlines with his every eyebrow-raising utterance.\n\n***\n\nWere he not his father\u2019s son, Rand Paul\u2019s credentials would have been enough only to qualify him to be a candidate for a state legislature.\n\nHe was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1963, and raised in Lake Jackson, Texas. He attended Baylor University for a few years, and did so well on the MCAT that he was able to go to the Duke University School of Medicine without earning a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nIn 1993, he moved with his wife to Bowling Green, Kentucky\u2014whose history is highlighted by having been the nominal Confederate capital during the Civil War in a state that never seceded from the Union\u2014and there began practicing ophthalmology.\n\nThe following year, he founded Kentucky Taxpayers United\u2014becoming something of a local Grover Norquist. The anti-tax group issued report cards on state legislators\u2019 records and asked them to sign a pledge. Then, in 2002, KTU reportedly became inactive\u2014marking the end of Paul\u2019s independent political involvement. Making an audacious bid for the U.S. Senate after eight years on a political hiatus would not strike most people at the logical next step.\n\nTaking into account his father, of course, the trajectory of Paul\u2019s political career makes more sense.\n\nRon Paul, an OBGYN, Air Force vet, and avid reader of Ayn Rand and Austrian economists like Hans F. Sennholz, decided to run for Congress in 1971, after President Richard Nixon killed the gold standard. He first entered the House in 1976 \u2014 and that year brought the younger Paul, then 13, with him to the Republican National Convention in Kansas City, Missouri, where Gerald Ford edged out Ronald Reagan for the presidential nomination.\n\nAs described by Vogue, Paul \u201cenlisted his brothers and sisters in one of his father\u2019s congressional campaigns, drew up door-knocking maps, and studied voting returns and poll data. At every turn, it was his father he looked up to.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, having jumped the Republican ship, the elder Paul mounted a campaign for president as a Libertarian\u2014with his son volunteering to help\u2014ultimately securing less than 0.50 percent of the vote.\n\nIn the ensuing two decades after his defeat, the elder Paul occupied his place in Congress as what some have called a \u201cgrab-bag Libertarian\u201d: he is a Constitutionalist, an isolationist, in favor of the legalization of marijuana, and against Medicare, the Federal Reserve and abortion. His government-should-stop-meddling message, highlighted for decades in his controversial newsletters\u2014which were, before blogs, a popular medium for conservative discourse\u2014earned him fans across generations and socioeconomic classes. By the time Paul decided to make another attempt for the White House in 2008, he was a right-wing folk hero with a cult-like following\u2014coined the \u201cliberty movement\u201d\u2014ready to organize.\n\nWith the country in debt, on the verge of economic collapse, suffering from war fatigue, engaging in rampant overspending, and welcoming domestic spying, it was, in many ways, the perfect time for the elder Paul\u2019s message to break through. He criticized both parties, and he gained fans on both the left and on the right.\n\nPaul began his campaign, as Slate's Dave Weigel put it, \u201cas a fringe candidate with a mailing list.\u201d But soon he began to make the Internet work for him. In a single day\u2014the 234th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party\u2014as the younger Paul spoke on his behalf at Faneuil Hall in Boston, Paul raised $6 million from online contributors in a \u201cmoneybomb.\u201d In total, the elder Paul had raised $34 million by the end of his campaign.\n\nThe enthusiasm\u2014spiritual and financial\u2014for the elder Paul was not enough to defeat the establishment. After failing to secure the nomination, he eventually suspended his campaign\u2014but he did not suspend his political apparatus. That, he passed down to his son, around whom a campaign to draft him for the Senate had begun to shape up.\n\n***\n\nRand Paul announced he would form an exploratory committee for a Senate campaign at just the right time, in May 2009. Dr. Scott Lasley, a political science professor at Western Kentucky University (located in Bowling Green), told me that what set the stage for Paul\u2019s candidacy was a combination of his father\u2019s status, and the advent of the Tea Party. \u201cAll these things were necessary, but probably weren\u2019t sufficient on their own [to make him a viable contender],\u201d he said. \u201cHe probably had more of an impact on the Tea Party than the other way around.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe very thing that makes him formidable could prove to be the very thing that makes him difficult to vote for\u2014and that\u2019s his last name.\u201d\n\nPaul formally announced in August, and from the start, was transparent about his objective to harness what he could of his father\u2019s strengths and channel them in such a way that he would be viewed as a more broadly electable candidate. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported at the time: \u201cHe said his father\u2019s political organization largely remains intact and could be reactivated to raise money for his Senate race.\u201d\n\nHe told the Louisville Courier-Journal of his candidacy: \u201cSome of [my father\u2019s] supporters viewed [his campaign] as a cause\u2026This could not only be a cause, but a winnable race.\u201d\n\nMaking up Paul\u2019s campaign staff were familiar faces from the cause.\n\nJack Hunter, an official blogger for the elder Paul, became a main adviser for Rand. (Hunter would ultimately be asked to leave the campaign after it was revealed he had previously expressed a number of controversial opinions\u2014including that Abraham Lincoln deserved to be assassinated.) Doug Stafford, described by the National Review as having been \u201cin the inner circle of Ron Paul\u2019s presidential campaign,\u201d became one of Paul\u2019s closest and most trusted campaign advisers. And Jesse Benton was brought on to serve as Paul\u2019s campaign chair, after working on two of his father\u2019s congressional races (and marrying his granddaughter), effectively replacing David Adams, a longtime Paulite.\n\nPaul also borrowed his father\u2019s fundraising tactics.\n\nOn August 20 2009 (a date chosen to honor the elder Paul\u2019s 74th birthday), Paul had a moneybomb, with the goal of raising $1 million. He fell short, taking in less than half that amount, but his haul was enough to scare his primary opponent, Trey Grayson. \u201cWe were curious how the money his dad could raise would translate to our race,\u201d Grayson would later tell New York magazine. \u201cThat was the first time where I said, Wow, maybe there really is something here. He could be a lot more trouble than we thought. This is more than a few diehards. This is real. Money is real.\u201d\n\nGrayson saw red meat in the out-of-state origins of Paul\u2019s donations. Of the roughly 15,500 donors who would ultimately contribute to Paul\u2019s campaign, less than 3,500\u2014fewer than a quarter\u2014came from Kentucky.\n\nGrayson pounced, telling The New York Times in November, \u201cThe celebrity factor is what is attracting people now\u2026Mr. Paul has his dad\u2019s following and his dad\u2019s e-mail list, and he has shown he can raise money outside of the state\u2026When voters really start paying attention, they\u2019re going to find out that one candidate is getting 90 percent from Kentucky and the other is getting 80 percent of his money from out of the state, and that is not going to sit well with them.\u201d\n\nPaul didn\u2019t blink. Asked by the Courier-Journal about the out-of-state support, his spokesperson shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t care\u2026This is a race of national importance.\u201d\n\nGrayson did his best to paint Paul as a radical by welding his father\u2019s record to his platform, sending out a press release which read, \u201cPaul: Too crazy for Kentucky\u201d\u2014an ill-advised strategy, given that being a Paul was precisely what his Tea Party supporters seemed to love about him, and Paul embraced it. When Alex Jones asked him, \u201cYour policies are basically identical to your father, correct?\u201d Paul said, \u201cI\u2019d say we'd be very, very similar. We might present the message sometimes differently\u2026I think in some ways the message has to be broadened and made more appealing to the entire Republican electorate because you have to win a primary.\u201d\n\nAnd he did. Paul trampled Grayson, and then sailed through the general election, beating his opponent, Attorney General Jack Conway, a Democrat, 56 to 44 percent. When Paul was sworn in January 5, 2011, he became the first member of Congress to have a parent simultaneously serving in a different chamber.\n\n***\n\nRand Paul had the benefit of observing both what made his father likable and popular, and what made him an also-ran. The elder Paul had many elements of a marketable message\u2014but sounding, as he does, a bit like someone who might stop you on the street to hand you a pamphlet about gold, he was the wrong messenger. Paul has clung to their shared isolationist, minimalist government ideals\u2014particularly marketable is his opposition to the National Security Agency\u2019s mass surveillance programs, which has generated outrage and diplomatic upheaval\u2014while moving toward the center-right establishment. He is comparatively statesmanlike, and wears his willingness to do what it takes to win on his sleeve\u2014but unlike in scripture, the sins of the father may be visited on the son in presidential politics.\n\nLast week, as it emerged that Paul was leading the polls in Iowa\u2013where the caucuses will be held in 17 months\u2013and in New Hampshire\u2013the location of the first primaries, his father offered his opinion on the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 in the form of a column. In it, he chided \u201cwestern media outlets\u201d for rushing \u201cto repeat government propaganda on the event\u201d; and President Obama for holding a press conference \u201cbefore an investigation\u201d had been conducted. He wrote: \u201cwestern media and politicians joined together to gain the maximum propaganda value from the disaster. It had to be Russia; It had to be Putin, they said.\u201d\n\nThe commentary resulted in headlines like, Paul is Putin\u2019s New Best Friend, and Paul Says U.S. May Share Responsibility for Malaysia Airplanes Crash. Rand Paul, as apparently is his policy, had no comment.\n\nIn March, he told the Daily Caller\u2019s Alex Pappas that he has \u201cpretty much quit answering\u201d questions about his father\u2019s statements. \u201cI think over time, people will notice there are distinctions and differences,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the Senate three years, and I\u2019ve created a record myself.\u201d\n\nBut three years is not a very long time to be removed from a campaign run on your bloodline\u2014certainly not long enough to make a convincing argument that ignoring it will make the association go away.\n\nIn a documentary about the notorious late Lee Atwater\u2014an adviser to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush\u2014reporter Sam Donaldson recalled him being the first to advocate the push poll. \u201cThe first few questions are routine. The next question is, \u2018Well, if you came to believe that Governor X was a pedophile, would that change your opinion?\u2019 Now, the poller hasn\u2019t said that Governor X is a pedophile\u2014they simply planted the idea that if he were\u2026\u201d It\u2019s a transparently sinister way to make someone guilty by grouping them with an unsavory concept.\n\nSimilarly, Rand Paul is seldom discussed without a mention of Ron Paul, and vice versa. For the majority of the public who are not \u201cI STAND WITH RAND\u201d sign-wielding supporters, distinguishing Rand Paul the individual from the tree he fell so close to may prove difficult.\n\n\u201cThe very thing that makes him formidable could very well prove to be the very thing that makes him difficult to vote for\u2014and that\u2019s his last name,\u201d Hogan Gidley, a veteran Republican operative, told me. To be electable, Paul will have to find the balance between appealing to the libertarian base that he inherited, and to establishment voters. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s balanceable,\u201d Gidley said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a very difficult balance. Rand Paul is a very talented politician ... but the question you asked me wasn\u2019t \u2018Is he a skilled politician?\u2019 The question was, \u2018Is he skilled enough to master that balance?\u2019 And I don\u2019t think he is, and I don\u2019t know that anybody is.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:57.095+0000"}

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that the number of refugees fleeing Syria now exceeds 4 million, the largest refugee crisis in the UN agency\u2019s history.\n\nCruz\u2019s statement stands in stark contrast to his family story, which he frequently on the campaign trail uses to highlight the American dream and the importance of a country that values freedom and liberty. That story is about his father, Rafael Cruz, who fled Cuba to the United States after enduring torture at the hands of the Batista regime.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmerica, quite simply, saved my father. America gave him a chance\u2026 The freedom of America was the dream that allowed him to endure the brutality of Cuba. It was and is a beacon of hope for all those who, like him, have endured oppression,\u201d Cruz wrote in his recent memoir, A Time for Truth.\n\nIn early 2014, Cruz seemed to be singing a different tune: \u201cWe have welcomed refugees, the tired, huddled masses, for centuries\u2014that\u2019s been the history of the United States. We should continue to do so,\u201d he said in a Fox segment about Syrian refugees. \u201cWe have to continue to be vigilant to make sure those coming are not affiliated with the terrorists. But we can do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica, quite simply, saved my father. America gave him a chance,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nThe United States has been particularly closed off to Syrian refugees: as of June, NPR reported, America has taken in fewer than 1,000 Syrian refugees out of more than 4 million fleeing the country.\n\n\u201cSen. Cruz is advocating for humanitarian assistance to the refugees from both Syria and Iraq and North Africa,\u201d Cruz spokesperson Catherine Frazier told The Daily Beast. \u201cHowever, given the logistical challenges and the security risk posed by resettling large numbers of them far afield in the U.S., he is not in favor of this plan if the ultimate intent is to return them to their homes. As I\u2019m sure you are aware, Cuba is 90 miles from the United States, so this was not the case with the senator\u2019s father.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s position is especially frustrating for advocates who have been urging the United States to do more to confront the Assad regime and aid Syrian refugees. Evan Barrett, a political adviser to the Coalition for a Democratic Syria, a Syrian-American opposition umbrella group, called Cruz\u2019s Tuesday remarks \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the Cruz campaign feels compelled by recent events to develop a position on the Syria refugee crisis. But not referencing the Assad regime, whose aerial attacks are the primary progenitor of refugees\u2026 suggest a campaign that\u2019s in over its head,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cResettling refugees will not end the conflict, nor allow regular Syrians to return to their stolen lives. However, for a presidential candidate whose Syria policy is as shallow as our current president\u2019s, a more compassionate, informed stance on resettlement would be a good place to start.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe continued, \u201cCruz is right that rather than a patchwork refugee resettlement plan, Syria requires a political solution. However, like our current president, Cruz offers no policy substance as to how to get there. This bold rhetorical stance\u2014committing to destroying ISIS and fostering a climate for political negotiations\u2014without any policy substance is the exact disease that plagues our current administration.\u201d\n\n\n\nCruz blamed \u201cradical Islamism\u201d as the root cause for both the Shiite and Sunni violence in the region, arguing Tuesday that \u201cultimately, we need to address the cause of this crisis or we will just have more and more migrants displaced.\u201d But the Texas senator didn\u2019t explain what strategy might be.\n\nIn 2013, Cruz opposed airstrikes against the Assad regime, and later opposed arming the Syrian rebels. He wrote in The Washington Post that Assad was \u201cnot a direct threat to U.S. national security\u2026 Unilaterally avenging humanitarian disaster\u2026 is well outside the traditional scope of U.S. military action.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur immediate role should be to support our regional allies who are on the front lines through public and private assistance to the international organizations who are best poised to administer aid,\u201d Cruz said Tuesday.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:57.878+0000"}
{"entityId": 1575, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "At first, The Judicial Crisis Network backed Bush nominees. Now the dark money group reaches deep into state capitals. Here\u2019s how it grew.\n\nUpdated: New material has been added to this article since its original publication on 3/23.\n\n\n\nIt was a cold winter night in Washington, D.C., not long after President George W. Bush won a second term, and the mood at the upscale Italian restaurant was downright celebratory.\n\nThe most prominent guest was Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, but his table also boasted a mix of high-powered conservatives, including some deep-pocketed donors. Among the elite were Federalist Society executive Leonard Leo, fundraiser and lawyer Ann Corkery, and California real estate magnate Robin Arkley II. \u201cThe big prize was to sit next to Scalia,\u201d quipped one attendee at the soiree, adding that Arkley was one such lucky winner.\n\nAs it happened, the bash coincided with the birth of a new judicial advocacy outfit that Corkery was instrumental in launching, and Arkley in funding, according to conservative sources familiar with the events. The Judicial Confirmation Network (JCN), set up as a 501(c)(4) \u201csocial welfare\u201d group that doesn\u2019t disclose its donors, would prove to be a crucial player in drumming up support for Bush Supreme Court nominees John Roberts Jr. and Samuel Alito Jr.\u2014eventual allies for Scalia on the Court\u2019s right flank.\n\nIn the years since, JCN\u2019s modus operandi and battlegrounds have shifted\u2014particularly since Barack Obama won the White House, which prompted the group to sound the alarm and change its name to the Judicial Crisis Network. In the ensuing years, not only has it fought to block Obama\u2019s nominees to the high court, but it has spent millions to sway state judicial elections and attorneys general races, helping to uphold state laws backed by conservatives, nurture like-minded talent in the states, and advance pro-business, limited-government legal agendas aligned with its donors\u2019 leanings.\n\nTo expand its influence in state elections, JCN has emerged as a pipeline for secret money to other, better-known dark money groups like the Wisconsin Club for Growth and the American Future Fund which, in turn, have spent big bucks in state Supreme Court and AG races.\n\nJCN heightened its focus on AG races last year when it pumped $1 million in secret money into the Republican Attorneys General Association, making it the third-biggest contributor to RAGA and helping the GOP pick up three new slots so that it now controls the majority of state AG posts.\n\nJCN\u2019s pivotal part in the surge of spending on court elections has received scant attention. But in 2012, it dished out more than $2 million in court races in Michigan alone\u2014half of that in a single down-ticket state circuit contest, according to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network. And over the last two years, the organization contributed a minimum of about $2 million to groups that were involved in 2014 state judicial elections and efforts to influence how judges are chosen. Recipients of JCN checks included the many-tentacled Republican State Leadership Committee, which for the first time invested in court races around the country, spending more on them than any other outside group.\n\nMore broadly, in the last election cycle TV ad spending in state Supreme Court elections jumped to at least $13.8 million, according to a preliminary tally by the nonprofit Justice at Stake Campaign. Outside groups, both conservative and liberal, accounted for an estimated $4.9 million of that, or more than 35 percent\u2014a greater share than ever before.\n\nThe sharp rise in judicial election spending by JCN and other groups on both sides of the political aisle troubles some judicial candidates who have been targeted. \u201cTo the extent that judicial campaigns start looking like other campaigns, there\u2019s a risk that judges will be perceived as having a political agenda,\u201d Sam Ervin IV, a North Carolina Supreme Court justice, told The Daily Beast. Ervin, who was elected in 2014 and is the grandson of the celebrated senator who led Congress\u2019s investigation of the Watergate scandal, lost an earlier race in 2012 after a spending blitz by several outside groups totaling almost $2.6 million, much of it dark money including $75,000 from JCN. \u201cThe public is better served, in an environment where judges are elected, if they know the source of the funding for those campaigns,\u201d Ervin, a Democrat, added.\n\nTo fill its own coffers, JCN has increasingly relied on funding\u2014to the tune of nearly $4 million, according to IRS documents\u2014from another non-disclosing group, the Wellspring Committee, that\u2019s run by Corkery and was founded seven years ago with the help of conservative donors in the network led by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. Corkery\u2019s entree to that rarefied network came via JCN supporter Arkley, an early attendee of their famed retreats. And Ann Corkery and her husband, Neil\u2014who is JCN\u2019s treasurer\u2014are central figures in a cluster of other nonprofits, according to IRS documents.\n\nA fast rise\n\nJCN\u2019s early niche entailed working in tandem with a well-organized conservative coalition\u2014in which Leo, the Federalist Society\u2019s executive vice president, was a key player\u2014to ensure that Roberts and Alito won Senate confirmation. To that end, JCN spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2005 and January 2006 on radio and online ads, as well as on grassroots efforts, to shape public opinion. One example: The group ran a radio ad blitz in late 2005 in Arkansas, where the two Democratic senators\u2019 votes were considered in play, using Christmas themes and an appeal from a black minister.\n\nWell-connected consultants helped JCN get things up and running. One was Gary Marx, a rising social conservative star who Corkery recruited to became the group\u2019s executive director, according to a well-placed source.\n\nAnother was New York lawyer Wendy Long, a former clerk for Clarence Thomas. She left the law firm Kirkland & Ellis and signed on as counsel to JCN, becoming the organization\u2019s face on cable news and buttressing its legal bona fides.\n\nBut mostly, JCN\u2019s early rise was attributable to Corkery\u2019s ability to rope in a few big donors. \u201cAnn is very good at cultivating relationships and capitalizing on them,\u201d a conservative source observed.\n\n\n\nIn the last election cycle TV ad spending in state Supreme Court elections jumped to at least $13.8 million. Outside groups, both conservative and liberal, accounted for an estimated $4.9 million of that.\n\nRobin Arkley, the president and CEO of Security National Corp. who had tapped Corkery to be his political liaison and senior advisor, became a key underwriter of JCN\u2019s operations, to the tune of the high six or low seven figures, sources say. The pair went to some of the early fundraising and policy retreats held by the Kochs\u2014events that now draw a glittering cast of wealthy allies and conservative stars to raise millions for the brothers\u2019 network of politically active groups. Arkley was also a financial backer of the Federalist Society. \u201cArkley helped put Ann in play\u201d as a liaison to funding for advocacy groups on the right, said one conservative.\n\nCorkery had a breakthrough year in 2008. Koch operatives gave her the reins to their fledgling Wellspring Committee, a dark money conduit that began pumping funds to other dark money Koch-backed groups like Americans for Prosperity. At the same time, Corkery served as a finance vice chair for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nThough Corkery\u2019s most direct Koch ties frayed after the \u201908 elections and Arkley\u2019s wallet took a hit in the financial crisis, according to sources and reports, Corkery mined other big donors she\u2019d been courting for Wellspring, such as John Templeton Jr., a Pennsylvania philanthropist, and New York hedge fund mogul Paul Singer, conservative sources said.\n\nConservative and business groups had been pouring money into state court elections through the early 2000s in order to produce a friendlier legal climate\u2014one that curbed tort liability for corporations, for example. Smart marketing and intellectual heft provided by Leo\u2019s Federalist Society helped them notch significant gains. From 2000 to 2009, business and conservative groups spent more than twice as much on state court elections as plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, unions, and liberal groups\u2014$26.3 million to $11.9 million, according to Justice at Stake.\n\nWellspring, followed quickly by JCN, became big players in directly and indirectly funding state Supreme Court races. In 2008, for example, it funneled $200,000 to a Wisconsin group that produced the negative attack ads that helped a conservative eke out a victory over a sitting Supreme Court justice, tipping control of the bench to the right. In 2009, Wellspring grants went to groups trying to change judicial selection methods in Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nIn 2010, Wellspring began sending money directly to JCN, giving it and a related organization, the Judicial Education Project, $400,000; an additional $306,000 came in 2011, then $1.5 million in 2012 and $1.4 million the next year. Big grants also went to other organizations playing in judicial politics\u2014including $400,000 in 2011 for Wisconsin Club for Growth, a major actor in that state\u2019s shift to a conservative Supreme Court majority.\n\nWisconsin Club for Growth was also aided by JCN to the tune of more than half-a-million dollars from mid-2012 to mid-2013 as JCN began to function as a dark money conduit like Wellspring. The Wisconsin group spent close to $400,000 to help win a second 10-year term for Justice Patience Roggensack.\n\nAnd an investigation into whether Walker illegally coordinated efforts with several groups\u2014including Wisconsin Club for Growth\u2014in the run-up to his 2012 recall vote now depends on a ruling by the state\u2019s justices. The special prosecutor leading the probe has asked at least one\u2014perhaps all four\u2014of the court\u2019s conservatives to recuse themselves because of support they have gotten from the groups. (Given recent history and the state\u2019s weak judicial conduct rules, court observers say that seems unlikely.)\n\nThe lower court money bomb\n\nWhile turning, and keeping, the Wisconsin court conservative was a high priority for JCN and others on the right, the group didn\u2019t spend much cash there directly. But the opposite was true in neighboring Michigan, where JCN laid out more than $2 million on two 2012 court races. About half the money went to an effort to keep law professor Bridget McCormack from sitting on the state Supreme Court, including a last-minute ad accusing McCormack of volunteering to represent terrorists, featuring the mother of a soldier killed in Afghanistan. (McCormack did volunteer one of her law school clinics to represent a Guantanamo detainee, though he was released before the students communicated with him.)\n\nThe other $1 million, though, was spent attempting to kick an Oakland County Circuit Court judge off the bench\u2014and JCN\u2019s spending in that race was matched by Americans for Job Security, which had earlier benefited from Wellspring largesse.\n\nSuch staggering spending on a lower court contest may be unprecedented, and it was far from clear why the groups were interested. One possible explanation: a funder with an ax to grind.\n\nWho that was may never be known. But \u201cpretty much everyone believed\u201d it to be Manoj Bhargava or a person or entity linked to him, said a Michigan lawyer who had a ringside seat at the time; other attorneys and journalists in the state told The Daily Beast the same thing.\n\n\n\nThe Indian-born Bhargava, who invented the now-ubiquitous 5-Hour Energy shot, might be seen by some as a walking contradiction. On the one hand, he lived as a monk in India for years and has taken a pledge to give more than half his wealth to charity. But he\u2019s also a fierce competitor who, according to a profile in Forbes, displays in his office cardboard tombstones bearing the names of rivals his company has beaten in court.\n\nA 2012 case before Circuit Judge Phyllis McMillen may shed light on the origins of the campaign against her. Bhargava, through 5-Hour\u2019s parent company Innovation Ventures, was suing a key 5-Hour contractor for allegedly stealing trade secrets. McMillen was presiding over the case. At first she issued a temporary restraining order against the contractor. As facts emerged, though, she lifted the TRO. To allow Innovation Ventures to \u201ccrush competitors\u201d unfairly, she said in court February 10, \u201cis certainly not something that\u2019s supported by public policy.\u201d\n\nMcMillen was running for her first full term in 2012. That spring, soon after she lifted the TRO, she and her colleagues who were also on the ballot learned they had opposition: a couple of lawyers from Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette\u2019s office. Three non-Michiganders had provided the seed money for their candidacies: Andrew McKenna of Virginia, a Republican fundraising consultant with ties to Bhargava, according to a well-placed source; John Templeton, one of Ann Corkery\u2019s funding sources; and John Bryan of Oregon, a retired oil and chemicals executive who spoke at one of the Koch confabs.\n\nConservative control of the Wisconsin court, enabled in no small part by the big pots of dark money dumped into the state, has proved vital to the rejection of challenges to two signature conservative policies championed by GOP Governor Scott Walker.\n\nTV ads sponsored by JCN and its dark money ally showed up closer to the election, with some attacking McMillen (one made her appear to have been lenient with a habitual offender) and others praising the challengers. \u201cThey were on every half-hour,\u201d McMillen told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt was relentless.\u201d There was radio, too, and a torrent of direct mail.\n\nBhargava did not respond to numerous requests for comment.\n\nIn any case, JCN\u2019s Wolverine State crusades didn\u2019t work out too well. McCormack is now a Supreme Court justice and McMillen won her contest, too. In early 2013, she ruled against Bhargava.\n\nAttorneys general become focus\n\nJCN\u2019s surging dark money dollars found a new outlet last year when the network ponied up $1 million to the Republican Attorneys General Association for its 2014 drive to help the GOP capture AG seats in Nevada, Colorado, and elsewhere. That made JCN RAGA\u2019s third-largest donor in a year when RAGA was instrumental in helping Republicans capture enough AG posts that they now hold the majority. RAGA and similar 527 organizations must disclose their donors, but the sources of JCN\u2019s contributions remain in the dark.\n\nOn top of that, JCN sent $750,000 to the Iowa-based American Future Fund, which started its own AG project between July 1, 2012, and June 30, 2013, tax filings show\u2014JCN\u2019s largest grant of that fiscal year. In turn, AFF chipped in $680,000 to RAGA last year.\n\nState attorneys general had been moving higher on JCN\u2019s political radar. Policy director and chief counsel Carrie Severino, who succeeded Wendy Long as JCN\u2019s counsel in 2010 and, like her, once clerked for Justice Thomas, wrote in National Review right before the 2012 elections that conservative AGs are \u201cemerging as key leaders in the battle for limited constitutional government.\u201d Many of them, she noted, had joined the challenge to Obamacare, and a number were also fighting the Dodd-Frank financial services overhaul and EPA regulations.\n\nDark money ties that bind\n\nThe JCN spending through RAGA to boost the GOP\u2019s share of AG slots is just one example of the synergies that the network has forged as a dark money vehicle. Other ties binding JCN to various groups it has funded\u2014and received money from\u2014are evident in the comings and goings of personnel, consultants, and board members. For instance, when Gary Marx stepped down as JCN\u2019s executive director in mid-2011, he took a similar post with Ralph Reed\u2019s Faith and Freedom Coalition (a group that Wellspring helped in 2010 with a $250,000 check). Likewise, last year Chris Jankowski became a consultant to JCN after spending several years running the Republican State Leadership Committee until he departed suddenly in early 2014, according to multiple sources. Both JCN and Wellspring had funneled hundreds of thousands to the RSLC, which has helped the GOP chart major gains in legislatures and other state offices. (RAGA had been part of that group but was spun off early last year.)\n\nTV ads sponsored by JCN and its dark money ally showed up closer to the election, with some attacking McMillen. \u201cThey were on every half-hour,\u201d McMillen told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt was relentless.\u201d\n\nBut JCN\u2019s tightest ties with any group or individual revolve around Ann and Neil Corkery, which meant that Wellspring\u2019s links to JCN were personal as well as political. Serendipitously Ann Corkery\u2019s husband Neil was JCN\u2019s treasurer, a paid part-time gig. The group\u2019s small board also includes Dan Casey, a veteran GOP operative and \u201cthe political and PR brains\u201d of that shop, says one source. Wellspring\u2019s board was made up of Ann Corkery and two people the Corkerys knew from their work with Catholic groups.\n\nBut in 2011, the ties between these two dark money machines grew even closer when Ann Corkery sacked her two fellow board members at Wellspring and replaced them with her daughter and the son of JCN board member Casey, according to IRS filings and former board members. One of those ousted, treasurer Steven Wagner, said, \u201cI never saw any financial records. I was treasurer in name only.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, tax records show that Neil Corkery was not only treasurer of JCN, president of its allied Judicial Education Project, and executive director of a charity called the Sudan Relief Fund, all of which paid him salaries; but he also drew paychecks from at least four other organizations: the anti-gay union National Organization for Marriage, ActRight Action, the Catholic Association Foundation, and Catholic Voices. His total earnings were almost $450,000, and his weekly workload was 105 hours in the first half of the year, the groups' IRS filings show, before dropping back to a mere 80.\n\n\n\nSome who are familiar with the groups are dubious about that workaholic schedule\u2014especially at the Sudan charity, where Corkery was paid $235,000 for a supposed 40-hour workweek. Neither Ann nor Neil Corkery responded to phone messages or written requests for comment on this story.\n\nMoving Ahead\n\n\n\nCritics notwithstanding, the board changes at Wellspring a few years ago seemed to spell good news for JCN, coinciding with the two recent years in which JCN received close to $3 million from Wellspring and allowing the network to ramp up its efforts in the states.\n\nAnd JCN has been otherwise busy, too\u2014churning out, for example, amicus briefs for major legal challenges to Obama administration policies, including the high-profile case that now threatens to undermine key sections of Obamacare which was argued before the Supreme Court in early March.\n\nThe group doesn\u2019t always toe the mainstream GOP line: It has at times weighed in against Republicans in what look like internal party spats fueled by donor preferences.\n\nUltimately JCN looks poised to continue its role as a dark money juggernaut in 2016 in state and federal elections\u2014both directly and via allied dark money and 527 conduits. If JCN\u2019s recent history proves a guide, that means voters going to the polls in 2016 will remain largely uninformed about who\u2019s writing the network\u2019s big checks for ad and grassroots drives to help elect the highest judicial and legal officers in the states, and senators who may well have to approve nominees to fill future Supreme Court vacancies.\n\nRobert Maguire of the Center for Responsive Politics contributed to this piece", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:58.494+0000"}

Too bad all so many people can see is \u201cthugs.\u201d\n\nThe supposedly sophisticated twitterati take on what has happened after Freddie Gray\u2019s funeral is to essentially rationalize the riots by explaining that the looting we\u2019ve seen on our TV screens was just collateral damage for institutional racism.\n\nPut aside for the moment that many of the businesses and cars destroyed in the attacks were black-owned. Put aside also that Baltimore\u2019s mayor and police chief are black. Nevertheless, there are indeed structural issues that have combined to create this moment\u2014but they don\u2019t fit the narrative being proposed as higher wisdom.\n\nGALLERY: Chaos in Baltimore Deepens (PHOTOS)\n\n\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty\n\nFor example, several studies have shown that it\u2019s an op-ed page street myth that mass unemployment is inevitable when factory jobs move away from a city as they did in Baltimore (sources here). No people who had accomplished the Great Migration went to pieces just because a factory moved to the suburbs, or even China.\n\nThree key dynamics since the Civil Rights era 50 years ago created the inner-city misery we are now seeing urgently rise to the foreground today.\n\nFirst, the Black Power ideology that proliferated in the 1960s and \u201970s discouraged black communities from maintaining the old-time mantra that adversity meant that blacks have to try twice as hard. The wise insight was that after centuries in the United States, the persistent double standard was demeaning, and while that made basic sense, it changed black America\u2019s orientation towards individual initiative. That helps explain, for example, why only in the \u201960s did it become common for poor blacks to burn their own neighborhoods in protest. Even amidst Jim Crow, black people did not do this.\n\nSecond, in the late \u201960s, partly in response to the riots of the Long Hot Summers, welfare was transformed from a time-limited program intended for widows to an open-ended program that didn\u2019t care whether recipients ever got jobs. This had the unintended consequence of discouraging marriage, and made it easier for women to raise kids without the father around. This, a story too little told (read it here), decisively impacted the black experience nationwide.\n\nFinally, the War on Drugs created a black market alternative to legal work for poor black men underserved by bad schools. Frankly, The Wire explained this dynamic better than any academic analysis.\n\nRacism is too simplistic an explanation for all of this, as is an idea that \u201cit\u2019s complicated\u201d where what\u2019s really meant is \u201ccomplicated racism.\u201d Welfare was opened up by liberals who thought they were doing black people a favor, often at the behest of black protesters. The Rockefeller drug laws that ended up penalizing crack over powdered cocaine were supported by black Congress members.\n\nTo wonder why, oh why, whites see blacks as violent rings a little hollow at times like these.\n\nHistory is messy. But we live in the present and what poor black Baltimoreans see is abuse. The War on Drugs assigns cops to black neighborhoods where, inevitably, encounters tend to be surly and often violent. A vicious cycle starts. What a poor black Baltimorean knows in 2015, what we all know in 2015, is that something needs to change.\n\nNow, to be sure, the rioters\u2019 actions are inherently inarticulate. Certainly some of them are simply opportunists\u2014it\u2019s no accident that most of the looters are young men; pure political protest is often more diverse. The people marching in Selma included women, older people, etc. And of course the riots and looting could also end up compounding many of white Americans\u2019 ugliest stereotypes of black communities and violence. To wonder why, oh why, whites see blacks as violent rings a little hollow at times like these.\n\nBut the reflexive liberal rush to moral relativism on the subject misses the mark as well. A certain contingent will not be disabused of the idea that inner-city Baltimore is the product of racism alone, as opposed to a complex cocktail of racism in the past, misapplied benevolence afterwards, and a cyclic process of dissonance now. Their take on all of this is better at assuaging white guilt than telling us where to go from here in a real world.\n\nThat is, neither the players nor their fellow-traveling spectators are in a position to see the whole picture. Yet something positive can still come of all this.\n\nToday, regardless of the complexities of how we got here, the main thing that keeps black America feeling alienated in its own land is the police. It\u2019s what animated the Black Panthers. It\u2019s what drove an entire genre of rap, celebrated by intellectuals as poetic prophecy. It\u2019s what a black person brings up if asked why they think racism is important. It\u2019s what has driven the arc of black history since last summer.\n\nIn that light, there is a genuine conversation about the cops and black people going on these days in America, and that wouldn\u2019t be true if there hadn\u2019t been riots in Ferguson.\n\nEven if the participants\u2019 and observers\u2019 take on that episode was distorted\u2014the entire \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d narrative was ultimately proven false by the Justice Department\u2014the overall result may have started something positive. To the extent that rioting can make any kind of sense, it would have been more appropriate in the wake of Eric Garner\u2019s or John Crawford\u2019s or Tamir Rice\u2019s murders.\n\nBut history is messy. What we have is the present. And in that present, one simple thing is imperative: America must de-escalate the persistent tensions between cops and young black men. The easiest and most sensible way to do that is to interrupt the foolish War on Drugs. The gradual easing of laws against marijuana sale and purchase are a start. The tenor of black America\u2019s response to cops murdering black men should be a spur to going further.\n\nIf one generation of black men grew up without thinking of the cops as the enemy, black America would be a new place making the best of a bad hand, and we would finally start getting past the current tiresome and troubling situation.\n\nYet with the camera pulled back further, so to speak, I suspect that something constructive could still come of this mess. This is how things happen\u2014history is always messy.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:58.734+0000"}

Well, so do nations. And we\u2019ve got some work ahead of us and it will require us reaching something of a consensus.\u201d\n\nSpeaking a day after the Supreme Court issued a decision rolling back campaign finance reform in McCutcheon v. FEC, Clinton said \u201cThere\u2019s too much that has gone on in our politics recently that is just pure ideology, pure partisanship, the disguise of commercial interest behind a political fa\u00e7ade and the result is that we\u2019re kind of marching backwards instead of forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompromise is an essential part of running a great democracy. We cannot afford to have people who deny the rights and the needs of compromise,\u201d she continued.\n\nClinton urged Americans to have conversations in kitchens, offices and \u201con the field watching your kids play soccer\u201d that would help promote the cause of compromise in a democracy. \u201cWe just need people to start talking and to not be afraid to talk to somebody who disagrees with you. This is one of my biggest problems that I see. Because if we don\u2019t begin to talk across all the lines that divide us, we will get further and further separate, and we can\u2019t afford to do that.\u201d\n\nHarkening back to her Midwest roots and her husband\u2019s relentless focus on appeals to the middle class, Clinton said, \u201cI\u2019m a product of the American middle class. I am grateful for everything that I was given as a child to prepare me to have a fascinating life, obviously. But I don\u2019t want to see other children denied that opportunity. And it is an economic issue, it\u2019s a moral issue, it\u2019s a political issue\u2026. There will always be disagreements about the particulars but we\u2019ve got to figure out how we\u2019re going to make our economy produce enough jobs so that particularly young people, the 6 million 18-to 24-year-old Americans who are neither in school nor in work have a ladder of opportunity that they are able to start climbing, that we produce inclusive prosperity.\u201d\n\nClinton then went on to describe her view of foreign policy, which relied on the same \u201cevidence-based decision making\u201d that Clinton touted domestically. She cited Max Weber\u2019s dictum that politics is \u201cthe slow boring of hard boards\u201d also applied to diplomacy and described the work needed to build the international coalition against Iran as one of \u201cpainstaking, microscopic advantages.\u201d\n\nIn the current climate, with the former Secretary of State already having a clear path to the Democratic nomination, a clarion call of hope and change may not be needed in 2016. Instead, a message based on managerial competence, consolidating the progressive advances of the Obama administration, and fixing a Washington plagued by partisan gridlock might what voters are looking for right now.

Inside the race bringing in big money.\n\nIt has all the makings of a Hollywood movie. Politically connected billionaires target a local election to secure victory for candidates supportive of a proposed billion dollar-mining venture. Their only obstacle is an underfunded, ragtag group of locals who want to preserve the environment. Who will win?\n\nThis isn\u2019t a movie, however, it\u2019s actually happening in Iron County, Wisconsin \u2018s April 1 County Board of Supervisors election. This sleepy part of Northern Wisconsin, home to about 6,000 people, is described as \u201ca place of incredible natural beauty\u201d with \u201c300 pristine lakes,\u201d waterfalls, and \u201c500 miles of great snowmobile trails.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Iron County has one other thing: Iron ore. And therein lies the interest of the billionaires. And not just one, but three, plus Wisconsin\u2019s ambitious Governor Scott Walker.\n\nBillionaire number one is Chris Cline, the man behind Gogebic Taconite (GTAC), the company that in 2011 first proposed $1.5 billion dollar massive open pit iron ore mine. The (over) promise of new jobs excited many in the county. But some local residents, including the nearby Chippewa Indian tribe, objected because of the environmental hazards posed by the mine that would ultimately extend for 22 miles.\n\nThis fight has now become the central issue in the next week\u2019s Iron County election. In the past, these races have been generally uncontested with the winner in each district receiving a few hundred votes. But this year, ten of the fifteen county seats are being contested as the pro and anti-mine candidates have squared off.\n\nThiede noted he has raised about $300 for his campaign to date and hopes not to raise over $1,000 or he will be required to file election reports.\n\nSo enter billionaires two and three: Charles and David Koch and their Americans for Prosperity group. This is the same group that spent $120 million plus in the 2012 election cycle supporting Republicans and are currently pouring millions into the 2014 election cycle on behalf of GOP candidates.\n\nLast week, the Koch brothers\u2019 AFP mailed out two different sets of fliers to Iron County residents, the first attacking candidates who oppose the mine and the second praising those who support it. As AFP\u2019s Wisconsin director David Fladeboe told The Wisconsin State Journal, these mailing were just the start of a campaign, \u201cto educate folks in Iron County about the issue.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what one of the fliers read:\n\n\u201cIron County, and the iron mines that drive our economy, is being targeted by wealthy environmental groups from outside of Wisconsin. They do not care if our stores close and our families go on welfare-they just want to shut the mines down, no matter what.\u201d\n\nThe flier then lists the names of the seven candidates targeted by the AFP along with their respective phone numbers and urges residents to call these \u201canti-mining radicals.\u201d\n\nBeing from New Jersey, I never spoke to an \u201canti-mining\u201d radical, so thanks to phone numbers provided by the AFP, I called two of them. Aileen Potter explained she was \u201cshocked\u201d AFP was targeting her, especially since she had not taken a position on the mine yet because she was awaiting more environmental studies.\n\nPotter also pointed the AFP\u2019s ludicrous allegation that some want to \u201cshut the mines down.\u201d As Potter explained, there hasn\u2019t been a working mine in the area since the 1960s. So how can you shut down something that doesn\u2019t exist?\n\nRichard \u201cDick\u201d Thiede, a 73-year-old retired businessman running in the 10th district, actually does oppose the mine. Thiede had been appointed in late 2011 to Iron County\u2019s \u201cMining Impact Committee.\u201d However, the County Board disbanded the committee shortly after a January 2012 meeting in which members \u201cgrilled\u201d GTAC president Bill Williams.\n\n\n\nThe committee, per Thiede, was then re-formed in April and packed with only pro-mining advocates. Curiously, the minutes for the January meeting with GTAC\u2019s president Williams are not posted on the county\u2019s website even though almost every other meeting\u2019s minutes are and, Thiede, who was secretary of committee at the time, submitted them.\n\nThiede, who currently has 102 likes on his campaign\u2019s Facebook page, scoffed at the idea that wealthy environmental groups are funding the candidates. Thiede noted he has raised about $300 for his campaign to date and hopes not to raise over $1,000 or he will be required to file election reports.\n\nI know \u201call politics is local,\u201d but to truly understand this issue, you have to look beyond the pristine lakes of Iron County and to the state capitol where Governor Walker has a cozy relationship with pro-mining interests. After all, between 2010 and 2012, pro-mining groups donated over $11 million to Walker's campaign including thousands from GTAC\u2019s Chris Cline.\n\nSo how did this relationship help GTAC? Well, in January 2013, Walker signed into a law a Republican championed pro-mining bill that was drafted with the \u201cinput\u201d of GTAC. This law, which passed without a single Democratic vote, \u201cdramatically\u201d reshaped Wisconsin's mining regulations, making it easier for GTAC to secure regulatory approval.\n\n\n\nAnd that brings us back to Iron County\u2019s April 1 election. The anti-mining local candidates, if they win, could potentially stand in the way of this elaborate scheme. But thankfully the Koch brothers are there, just as they have been in the past when Scott Walker needed them.\n\nThis all appears to be legal, but I doubt I'm the only one who feels something is horribly wrong. This is reminiscent of the \u201ccooper kings\u201d who in the early 1900\u2019s controlled Montana politics with their mining money.\n\nSo how will the movie end? Will the underdogs prevail through hard work and gumption or will billionaires turn Wisconsin into their own playground? I'm hoping for a fairy tale ending, but millions of dollars in campaign contributions and the Citizens United decision tells me otherwise.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:07:59.037+0000"}

He then saw a small tag reading:\n\n\u201cMade in Mexico.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe elder Nickol called the firm\u2019s headquarters. He was assured that the tag was genuine. He was all the more devastated that nobody had bothered to tell him that the firm was outsourcing.\n\nHe responded as an honorable man who took pride in a long-established reputation for selling good American-made jeans and was now faced with being party to sacrificing loyal American workers in the name of greed.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Nope,\u2019\u201d the son recalls.\n\nThe father resigned and resolved that he would keep providing his loyal customers with good American-made jeans even if he had to make them himself. His son, B.J., joined him in doing just that in a barn on the family farm in the town of Arcanum.\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s give it a go,\u2019\u201d the son says. \u201cIt definitely had its challenges.\u201d\n\nThey made a first pair and then a second and then a third.\n\n\u201cI think we had a little closet to put some inventory,\u201d the son says.\n\nHis mother also pitched in.\n\n\u201cIt was the three of us,\u201d the son says.\n\nFor the first two years, they made no profit at all, and they had to support themselves by working other jobs.\n\n\u201cInsurance, things like that,\u201d the son reports.\n\nThe only easy part was deciding what to call their new business.

A Trump supporter might say that at least the items are not Chinese made. But in a sense, they are. Virtually all the garment factories in Lesotho are owned by Chinese and Taiwanese businessmen who shifted the manufacturing from their native countries to take advantage of the African Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000, which waived customs duties for garments imported to America from sub-Saharan Africa. And the wages in Lesotho are low even by Chinese standards.\n\nIn truth, nothing could be easier for Trump than to put his clothing labels where his mouth is and make America a little greater by ensuring that his shirts are as American made as his hats. He need only contact the All American Clothing Company, which stands ready to produce even those shirts with \u201cTrump National Golf Club\u201d on the breast.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do some embroidery,\u201d B.J.

According to a recent study by the University of Connecticut, only 39 percent of Americans have even heard of Common Core, but of those who have, 27 percent think it will not impact the quality of education in their communities and 30 percent say they think it will be detrimental.\n\nLegitimate arguments against Common Core include the fact that the program is overwhelmingly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; that the short timeline for implementation is unrealistic and amplifies the high-pressure testing culture of No Child Left Behind; and that, while the program is completely optional, only states that have adopted \u201cinternationally benchmarked standards and assessments that prepare students for success in college and the workplace\u201d are eligible for the Obama Administration\u2019s Race to the Top competitive grants\u2014and states that adopted Common Core standards by August 2010 received extra points on their Race to the Top applications. Education policy expert Diane Ravitch opposes Common Core because the standards were developed behind closed doors, without the help of informed, interested parties like early childhood and special education experts, and thrust upon schools before their effectiveness could be tested. Just last month, comedian Louie C.K. got on the anti-Common Core bandwagon, tweeting pictures of the tests his young daughters are practicing for at their New York City public school, calling it \u201cthis massive stressball that hangs over the whole school,\u201d and blaming Common Core for making his kids hate math.\n\nBut as a new report by the non-profit Southern Poverty Law Center points out, the loudest, angriest voices in the Common Core debate are making a case that is not even remotely based in reality. From the farthest reaches of the Christian right to Conservative pundits and even elected officials, a radical, factless propaganda campaign has been building that, the SPLC suggests, looks poised to take down not only Common Core but the entire institution of public education.\n\nAccording to the SPLC, the most common falsehoods perpetrated by the Common Core conspiracy campaign include the beliefs that the federal government has created a mandatory curriculum for all schools meant to brainwash students with liberal, anti-Christian dogma; that adopting the Common Core standards means states forfeit local control over education to the federal government; and that the government and big businesses are scheming to track students\u2019 personal information from kindergarten to adulthood through Common Core testing.\n\n\u201cPatriot,\u201d Tea Party, other Christian-Right groups\u2014from the small and grassroots to the Koch-affiliated\u2014 are dedicating significant amounts of time, money, and manpower to tearing down Common Core, using incendiary rhetoric.\n\n\u201cPublic schools have indeed become the most dangerous places in America,\u201d Anita Staver, president of the John Birch Society-affiliated Liberty Counsel wrote in the group\u2019s August, 2013 newsletter. \u201cWe cannot stick our head in the sand while our children are held hostage in government indoctrination camps.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to Catholic Bishops that was later re-printed in the Catholic magazine Crisis, Phyllis Schlafly, head of the conservative, \u201cpro-family\u201d Eagle Forum, slammed Common Core standards for \u201cactive promotion of gay marriage, and other federal efforts designed to dismantle society.\u201d She declared, \u201cWe cannot remain complacent as this administration takes aim at our children.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildren are our righteous seed and Satan is after them,\u201d televangelist and Columbus, Ohio megachurch pastor Rod Parsley wrote in the Christian magazine Charisma. \u201cHe has turned our public schools into cesspools of godless propaganda where God is publicly mocked and reviled. It is time to take a stand against the devil.\u201d\n\nWhile each of these claims may seem more ridiculous than the last, the SPLC report urges that they not be dismissed as the bluster of a few rogue nutjobs. Several popular and far-reaching members of the right-wing media are also getting in on the Common Core conspiracy mongering, disseminating these dramatic and unfounded theories into the mainstream.\n\nIn 2010, the SPLC says, right-wing talking head Glenn Beck sponsored two anti-Common Core strategizing conferences organized by self-taught (and widely discredited) evangelical historian David Barton. Since then, Beck has continued to take shots at Common Core on his online TV and radio shows at TheBlaze.com.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about to go federal,\u201d Beck warned, inaccurately, in one video on his site. \u201cThis is top down education from the federal government, dictating to local schools what they must teach and how they must teach it.\u201d\n\nProlific conservative columnist Michelle Malkin has called Common Core a \u201cTrojan Horse,\u201d and a \u201ccreepy federal data-mining racket\u201d that supposedly forces school districts and state governments to \u201cpimp out highly personal data on children\u2019s feelings, beliefs, \u2018biases,\u2019 and \u2018flexibility\u2019 instead of doing their own jobs of imparting knowledge and minding their own business.\u201d\n\nCal Thomas, one of the most widely syndicated columnists in the country, appears in more than 500 newspapers including USA Today, is aired on over 300 radio shows and is a Fox News commentator. He has been using these platforms to tell his large audience that \u201ca mass exodus from government schools is the only way to preserve the souls and minds of children.\u201d\n\nThen, of course there\u2019s IndoctriNation, a 2011 film financed by companies that make homeschooling materials, which poses as a documentary on the evils of public schools in America. The SPLC notes that notorious conspiracy theorist and talk radio host Alex Jones endorsed the movie and, in an episode of his radio show devoted to it, told parents, \u201cYou\u2019re handing your kids over to a bunch of globalist scumbags\u201d who worship the devil and plan to create a New World Order.\n\nThe SPLC suggests that the campaign against Common Core is growing in tandem with attacks against the public school system as a whole, with the Christian right using the current controversy as an excuse to reignite decades-old battles against evolution, school prayer, sex-ed and, more recently, efforts to stop LGBT bullying.\n\n\u201cFrom a historical perspective, the Common Core is just the latest bogeyman in a fierce propaganda and political war being waged against the very concept of providing a publicly funded, secular education to every child,\u201d the report\u2019s authors write.\n\n\u201cChildren are our righteous seed and Satan is after them,\u201d wrote televangelist and Columbus, Ohio megachurch pastor Rod Parsley.\n\nIn a very handy timeline of events, the SPLC illustrates how Christian Right opposition to public schools and the homeschooling movement have grown over the decades since 1948, when the Supreme Court first declared religious instruction in public schools unconstitutional. Six decades after Brown v. Board of Education led to racial integration in schools, minorities now comprise nearly half of all public school students\u2014that\u2019s nearly twice the percentage of 30 years ago and it\u2019s growing. At the same time, public schools across the country are forming Gay-Straight Alliances and in 2013, California passed the nation\u2019s first law protecting transgender students from discrimination at school.\n\nAs the federal government and the high court have continued to expand the right to public, discrimination-free education to more groups of students, the number of homeschooled students in the U.S. has climbed from about 750,000 in 1995 to between 1.9 million and 2.4 million in 2006.\n\nThe latest iteration of the Christian Right\u2019s crusade against secular education is worth paying attention to because, with an identifiable villain like Common Core, groups with enough resources can wield real political and public influence to take down the program and, in effect, damage the public school system as a whole.\n\nAccording to the SPLC, The American Principles Project, a group founded by leading Christian Right thinker and major LGBT equality opponent Robert George, says it\u2019s spending $500,000 to fight the Common Core, releasing reports and videos on why the program is bad for America, sponsoring anti-Common Core conferences, and sending representatives to several state legislative hearings to testify against implementing the program.\n\nMore recognizable, however, are the advocacy groups associated with the conservative billionaire Koch brothers. According to a Politico report from January, the Koch-affiliated non-profit FreedomWorks, which is credited with giving birth to the Tea Party, is blatantly using opposition to Common Core to rally support for private and religious school vouchers and, eventually, to destroy the U.S. Department of Education altogether. Americans for Prosperity, another Koch-backed group, is pushing the anti-Common Core agenda at town hall meetings throughout the states.\n\nDavid Koch\u2019s history as a Libertarian politician offers some insight as to why arguably two of the country\u2019s most influential political donors might be interested in this fight. He ran for vice president in 1980 on the Libertarian ticket, the year when his party\u2019s platform reportedly called for \u201ccomplete separation of education and State\u201d and claimed that \u201cGovernment schools lead to the indoctrination of children and interfere with the free choice of individuals. Government ownership, operation, regulation, and subsidy of schools and colleges should be ended.\u201d\u2019\n\nAs the SPLC points out, the vicious campaign against Common Core is already having an impact on politics at the federal level. Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) and seven other senators have signed on to sponsor legislation to stop federal funding for any aspect of Common Core. U.S. Rep. Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma has compared Common Core standards to socialism. And potential Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has come under fire from the far-right factions of his own party for supporting the program.\n\nThe SPLC report\u2019s authors explain exactly how harmful destroying public education would be for the huge swath of the country that cannot afford to homeschool their children or send them to private schools. Without public schools, they write, the 48 percent of K-12 students that come from low-income families will have fewer pathways out of poverty. The 21 percent of students whose parents are immigrants will have less of a chance to assimilate. And children of color, estimated to makeup half of all American children within the next five years, \u201cwould be unprepared to make their way in modern society, crippling the economy and ruining chances of being globally competitive.\u201d Essentially, dissolving public education would achieve the exact opposite of the idealistic goals stated by the Common Core Standards Initiative.\n\nIn her most recent book Reign of Error: The Hoax of the Privatization Movement and the Danger to America\u2019s Public Schools, Diane Ravitch, one of the education field\u2019s most outspoken opponents of Common Core, echoes the SPLC\u2019s fears.\n\nPublic education \u201cexpanded opportunity to more people, distributed the benefits of knowledge to more people, and strengthened our nation,\u201d Ravitch writes. \u201cWhen public education is in danger, democracy is jeopardized. We cannot afford that risk.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:00.264+0000"}
{"entityId": 1581, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "America has a long history of politicians mangling their words. But only Donald Trump has managed to find voters who don\u2019t really seem to mind.\n\nWilliam Gladstone, the shrewd Victorian-era prime minister of the United Kingdom, once called political speech \u201cthe art of saying nothing in many words.\u201d Today\u2019s major candidates try to perfect that art by staying relentlessly \u201con message.\u201d That\u2019s why media coverage of the early presidential campaign season so often focuses on gaffes, mistakes, and malapropisms.\n\nAnd for good reason. Campaign gaffes can produce real news. Former New Republic Editor Michael Kinsley famously defined a gaffe as a statement that inadvertently revealed something true\u2014such as views or policy plans that the politician would prefer to obscure. Kinsley\u2019s definition sprang out of reporting on a 1984 event at which President Ronald Reagan admitted to considering getting rid of the tax deduction on home mortgages.\n\nSubstantive mistakes, as when President Gerald Ford argued in 1976 that Poland wasn\u2019t dominated by the Soviet Union, get pounced on because they can be proven wrong with facts, and they challenge candidates to explain and justify themselves. Careful rehearsals of talking points have mostly eliminated these in recent years, though Texas Gov. Rick Perry didn\u2019t do himself any favors in 2012 when he forgot one of his points during an early Republican debate\u2014the \u201coops\u201d moment that came to define Perry\u2019s candidacy.\n\nBut the least consequential and most delightful campaign goofs are malapropisms, where a candidate gets tangled up in language and syntax and says something unintentionally funny. For example, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said in February that one of his top priorities was \u201creforming a broken immigration system and turning it into an economic\u2014a catalytic converter for sustained economic growth.\u201d Few would think that Bush didn\u2019t know the difference between the metaphor of a catalyst (a chemical agent of change) and the automobile exhaust device, but the mistake was worthy of his famously inarticulate brother, the much misunderestimated President George W. Bush.\n\nIn a sense, Trump\u2019s attitude is his policy\u2014a stance that appeals to many potential voters who are unimpressed by carefully reasoned debate.\n\nA month earlier, when former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin\u2019s teleprompter failed during a speech at the Iowa Freedom Summit, she soldiered on, urging her audience to rise to the defense of fellow conservatives: \u201cAnd we don\u2019t sit on our thumbs this time when one of our own is being crucified and falsely accused of whatever the hip accusation of the day happens to be, right?\u201d This is what\u2019s known as a portmanteau malapropism, awkwardly fusing two related words or ideas\u2014in this case the expressions \u201csit on our hands\u201d (do nothing) and \u201ctwiddle our thumbs\u201d (waste time). The comment did little to refudiate perceptions that Palin is America\u2019s current champion malapropagandist.\n\nNor are Democrats immune to malapropisms. Boston\u2019s former mayor, the late Thomas Menino, was famous for them, notably lamenting that parking problems in the city were \u201can Alcatraz around my neck.\u201d And Vice President Joe Biden, often mentioned as a potential challenger to Hillary Clinton, once introduced his boss as \u201ca man I\u2019m proud to call my friend. A man who will be the next president of the United States\u2014Barack America!\u201d\n\nThe candidates most likely to commit malapropisms tend to be those who cultivate a folksy, plain-spoken image that insulates them from charges of elite intellectualism. Biden is a good example, even though he\u2019s a well-educated lawyer. By way of contrast, politicians such as Clinton and Barack Obama, also lawyers, cultivate a more wonkish, academic image, choosing their words precisely and rarely stumbling over them. We may admire their precision, but they\u2019re not as much fun to read and write about.\n\nThis summer much attention has focused on the candidacy of celebrity businessman Donald Trump, who cultivates the image of a no-nonsense boss. Trump is not known for malapropisms, and has seemed unafraid of gaffes and mistakes that would damage other candidates. So far, courting controversy has worked for him: His poll standing has risen despite impolitic comments on immigration and the patriotism of rivals.\n\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s fearless insistence that he is right on all points, and his scorn of the need to apologize or correct himself, is in its own way \u201csaying nothing in so many words.\u201d He makes no attempt to explain his assertions with detailed policies, and seeks to shut down the conversation by sheer force of personality.\n\nIn a sense, Trump\u2019s attitude is his policy\u2014a stance that appeals to many potential voters who are unimpressed by carefully reasoned debate. He is, to borrow a phrase from the English playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan (from whose character, Mrs. Malaprop, we get the word malapropism), \u201cas headstrong as an allegory on the banks of the Nile.\u201d\n\nPlenty of Americans seem to like that in a politician.\n\nRobert Alden Rubin is the author of Going to Hell in a Hen Basket: An Illustrated Dictionary of Modern Malapropisms (Flatiron Books, 2015).

And did Obama break promises when he made the Iran deal?\n\nBy Linda Qiu and Louis Jacobson\n\nDonald Trump didn\u2019t back down Sunday from comments he made a day earlier that Vietnam War POW Sen. John McCain is \u201cnot a war hero.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week, Trump claimed his remarks at an Iowa forum were taken out of context by Republican candidates jealous of Trump\u2019s poll numbers.\n\n\u201cFour times, I said he is a hero,\u201d Trump said told ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz. \u201cBut you know, people choose little selective\u2014like you try to do\u2014people choose little selective pieces. If you read what I say or if you watch what I say, which is even better, you\u2019ll say that there was nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nWe took Trump up on his suggestion to watch what he said.\n\nThe truth is Trump is taking his own comments out of context. We rate his claim Mostly False.\n\nHere\u2019s the transcript of Trump talking with Republican pollster Frank Luntz, which starts with Trump responding to McCain calling some Trump Arizona supporters \u201ccrazies.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201c[McCain] insulted me and he insulted everybody in that room. And I said somebody should run against John McCain, who has been, in my opinion, not so hot. And I supported him for president. I raised $1 million for him. That\u2019s a lot of money. I supported him, he lost, he let us down. But he lost and I never liked him much after that \u2019cause I don\u2019t like losers. But, but\u2014Frank, Frank, let me get to it.\u201d\n\nLuntz: \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero \u2026\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero\u2026\u201d\n\nLuntz: \u201cHe\u2019s war hero.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cHe is a war hero\u2026\u201d\n\nLuntz: \u201cFive and half years in a Vietnamese prison camp\u2026\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren\u2019t captured. So he\u2019s a war hero \u2026\u201d\n\nLuntz: \u201cDo you agree with that?\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero, because he was captured, OK? I believe, perhaps, he\u2019s a war hero. But right now he said some very bad things about a lot of people. So what I said is John McCain, I disagree with him that these people aren\u2019t crazy.\u201d\n\nTrump said McCain \u201cis a war hero\u201d five times, but always with strings attached. Twice, he was interrupted by Luntz before he could finish his sentence. Once, the statement was preceded by \u201cI believe, perhaps.\u201d And the last two times, Trump added \u201cbecause he was captured.\u201d He also, of course, started all this by saying McCain is \u201cnot a war hero.\u201d\n\nExperts told us these caveats change the meaning of the sentence entirely.\n\n\u201c\u2018He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured\u2019 implies that anybody who is captured is called a war hero, but there\u2019s really nothing special about them,\u201d said Kathleen Kendall, who studies political campaign communication at the University of Maryland.\n\nMcCain was taken prisoner by the Viet Cong when his plane was shot down in 1967. For five and a half years, he was tortured and held in solitary confinement amid attempts by the North Vietnamese to obtain information and false confessions, according to the Navy.\n\nWe\u2019re not exploring whether captivity is a marker of heroism, but Trump likely wasn\u2019t, either, says rhetoric scholar Paul Achter of the University of Richmond.\n\n\u201c[Trump] appears to have thought it would be a funny aside to the question he was answering,\u201d Achter said.\n\nIn short, Trump\u2019s self-defense is flimsy at best. As for his accusation of critics cherry-picking his comments, experts say the pot is calling the kettle black.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s taking his own words out of context. That\u2019s the offense he\u2019s charging the media with,\u201d Kendall said.\n\nWhile Trump and his antics continued to take up much of the political airspace Sunday, plenty was also made of the historic agreement reached between the Obama administration and Iran.\n\nCritics had much to say about the proposed nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cThis deal violates promises the president made to the American people on multiple fronts,\u201d 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said on CNN. \u201cIt is not an anytime, anywhere inspection system. It is an inspection process that will require arbitration over a 24-day period or longer that Iran can fight against and delay things.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s claim that the Iran deal \u201cviolates promises the president made to the American people\u201d because \u201cit is not an anytime, anywhere inspection process\u201d rates Half True.\n\nWhat\u2019s correct in Rubio\u2019s statement is that the proposed deal with Iran does not include anytime, anywhere inspections.\n\nAt an Iranian facility like Natanz, where more than 5,000 centrifuges will be operating, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will have cameras that provide 24-hour monitoring, said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist at the Harvard Kennedy School. In addition, the agreement says, \u201cIran will permit the IAEA regular access, including daily access as requested by the IAEA, to relevant buildings at [the Iranian nuclear facility at] Natanz...for 15 years.\u201d\n\nHowever, this sort of 24/7 surveillance will not be the rule everywhere in the Iranian nuclear archipelago.\n\n\u201cAt most locations, inspections will be every once in a while, on a schedule the inspectors judge to be sufficient based on the sensitivity of the activities at that location, how long it would take for Iran to do something there that would make a difference, and so on,\u201d Bunn said.\n\nAnd as Rubio said, even if Iran ultimately agrees to a contentious inspection, the wait could be as long as 24 days.\n\nWhat\u2019s less clear is Rubio\u2019s claim that anytime, anywhere inspections were an Obama promise.\n\nA top Obama adviser, Ben Rhodes, twice described the deal as granting \u201canywhere, anytime\u201d access.\n\nBut all the other descriptions provided by Rhodes, White House press secretary Josh Earnest, and President Obama were more nuanced. Those descriptions talked about a robust and intrusive inspection program but not anytime, anywhere.\n\nHere\u2019s how Obama put it in April: \u201cIran will face strict limitations on its program, and Iran has also agreed to the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program in history\u2026International inspectors will have unprecedented access not only to Iranian nuclear facilities but to the entire supply chain that supports Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201d\n\nThat phrasing was much more common in Obama administration descriptions of the deal and paints Obama\u2019s promise in a different light.\n\nAaron Sharockman contributed to this report.

That\u2019s the picture GOP campaigns and political groups are painting\u2014and it\u2019s working.\n\nAs the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria flails, Republican congressional candidates and political action groups are spending at breakneck speeds to attach the calamity to Democratic incumbents in vulnerable seats, and the worse it gets overseas, the worse it gets for those Democrats.\n\nLess than a month before Election Day, national security and foreign policy has emerged as a top-tier campaign issue for the first time in several years. In a Gallup poll released Monday, 78 percent of respondents said \u201cthe situation with Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria\u201d was extremely or very important to their vote. That\u2019s higher than the number of voters who are focused on the budget deficit, equal pay for women, immigration, and Obamacare, just behind jobs and the economy. The poll also showed Republicans with a 19 percent advantage over Democrats on ISIS and a 13 percent advantage on foreign affairs in general. In Gallup\u2019s April survey, foreign affairs ranked low on the voters\u2019 list of priorities and ISIS wasn\u2019t even on the questionnaire.\n\nIn recent weeks, GOP campaigns and outside groups, looking for any voter trend to capitalize on in the homestretch, have seized on Democratic incumbents\u2019 records on foreign policy and their past support for Obama administration policies. On Tuesday, the National Republican Senatorial Committee released a series of ads in four close Senate races focused on the president\u2019s perceived foreign-policy failures.\n\n\u201cBig money is going toward foreign policy, people are investing in it. Jobs and the economy will always be No. 1, but this has popped from issue maybe 5 or 6 to maybe 2 or 3,\u201d said Joe Pounder, president of America Rising LLC, which works with several GOP campaigns. \u201cISIS is just one of the things leading to a crisis mentality among voters. And when you don\u2019t have much new in the way of the economy going on, this is the new issue.\u201d\n\nWhile the campaigns had been doing much of the spending on their own, big super PACs and issue advocacy organizations are now joining the fight, spending millions on new national-security-related ads, according to public disclosures. The groups now increasing their investments in national-security-related ads include Crossroads GPS, the Ending Spending Action Fund, the Koch brothers-backed Concerned Veterans for America, and many others.\n\nTheir strategy is twofold: to paint the Obama administration and its supporters in Congress as failed stewards of foreign policy who have put the country at greater risk, and to call into question the competence and consistency of incumbent Democrats with incomplete or incoherent messages on the crises in Iraq and Syria.\n\nA Sept. 30 NRSC ad attacks Colorado Sen. Mark Udall for saying, \u201cISIS does not present an imminent threat to our nation.\u201d (He later walked back that comment.) The NRSC\u2019s Oct. 13 ad on Udall alleges that he missed over 60 percent of Senate Armed Services Committee meetings.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s foreign policy has already led to one slaughter in Iraq and Syria, and it may lead to another here in November for the Democrats.\u201d\n\nUdall\u2019s Oct. 14 response ad on national security does not address ISIS but focuses on the senator\u2019s criticism of the CIA and NSA for domestic surveillance. Polls show a very close race, with Udall slightly trailing Republican Cory Gardner.\n\nA new NRSC ad released Tuesday criticizes Iowa Rep. and Senate candidate Bruce Braley for claiming in a debate that he voted to give President Obama limited authority to strike ISIS in Iraq and Syria. In fact, he voted to give Obama authority to train and arm the Syrian rebels. His opponent, Joni Ernst, said she would have voted the same way.\n\nLast week, Crossroads GPS made a $5.1 million ad buy in North Carolina, and the first spot it released attacks Sen. Kay Hagan for skipping a congressional hearing on ISIS to attend a fundraiser. Hagan\u2019s campaign responded by pointing out that her opponent, Thom Tillis, has not articulated a specific policy for taking on ISIS that is substantially different from the president\u2019s.\n\nThe lack of a clear GOP policy on ISIS, besides criticizing the president and his allies, is less problematic for Republicans, as many GOP candidates in close races don\u2019t have any legislative record on the issue to defend. Even some Democratic political operatives are calling on their Senate candidates to get their messaging straight and present some clearer positions on how they would deal with ISIS.\n\n\u201cWhat these Republican candidates are benefiting from is an increased sense of fear: fear about ISIS, fear about Ebola, fear about overall general instability in the world,\u201d said Tommy Vietor, a former spokesman for the National Security Council now with Fenway Strategies. \u201cDemocrats can\u2019t run from Obama, they can\u2019t run from the issue, all they can do is state forcefully what they would do about it and show they have a backbone. Getting politically scared, as some of these candidates are doing, is a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a risk that Republicans could get too cocky on foreign policy and press the fear button so hard it backfires and calls their own competence into question. New Hampshire Senate challenger Scott Brown was among the first GOP candidates to ring the national-security alarm bell in ads but was mocked for suggesting that foreigners might bring Ebola into the United States by walking across the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\n\nArkansas Rep. Tom Cotton, a decorated war veteran, similarly warned that ISIS terrorists might collaborate with Mexican drug cartels and take advantage of the porous border.

{"entityId": 1584, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s explanation for \u201cemail-gazi\u201d brought out the skeptics and the conspiracy theorists. But it\u2019s because we\u2019ve come to assume Hillary is a creature of blind ambition rather than simply human.\n\nIt\u2019s not often that Fox News admits its existence in an alternate reality, so I plan to treasure for all time the eureka moment that came as Gretchen Carlson vamped between B-roll shots of Hillary Clinton and the United Nations\u2019 empty podium.\n\nSearching for a way to frame the former secretary of state\u2019s challenge at the upcoming press conference, Carlson made the obvious connection: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you watch House of Cards,\u201d she suggested to her hapless guest, \u201cbut this year, President Frank Underwood in the first few episodes, I won\u2019t ruin it for people, he talks a lot about transparency...Could Hillary Clinton take a really big step forward if she just came forward today and acted more like Frank Underwood and was totally transparent?\u201d\n\nOne needs only the loosest grasp of the plotline to Netflix\u2019s D.C.-set melodrama to appreciate that Carlson\u2019s question was nuts. If we\u2019re going to start asking our politicians to be more like their fictional counterparts, why not the guy from Independence Day? He is both fictional and a white man, which I assume are the qualifications Fox News wants the most in a Democrat. But if you\u2019ve actually watched House of Cards, the comparison\u2019s lunacy only deepens. (Spoiler alert!) For the comparison to make any sense at all, you have to be either totally ignorant of Underwood\u2019s alternately kinky, megalomaniac, and homicidal urges, or suspect that Clinton also might be capable of Secret Service threesomes and/or pushing a reporter in front of a train.\n\nBuried in Carlson\u2019s twitchy hypothetical is an even deeper reliance on fiction. It speaks to a belief in the mythical framework that supports not just House of Cards but most supposedly reality-based punditry, as well: an ingrained assumption that politicians are not just rational actors but inhumanly rational ones, creatures of pure logic and naked ambition whose motives can only be understood within the context of a power grab or financial gain.\n\nThese D.C. comic book schemers make every decision with an eye on the long ball. They have no personal/interior life apart from craven careerism; every interaction, every dalliance, every tweet is part of the Master Plan. All scandals, in this logic, are about checkmate in three-dimensional chess rather than a careless error in tic-tac-toe.\n\nMost politicians live through scandals to the degree that they can convince voters that their mistakes were not a part of House of Cards-scale schemes. It\u2019s the job of opposition media to look for genuine corruption or malice; allies, on the other hand, insist on bewildered shrugs or populist appeals to universal fallibility.\n\nBill Clinton knew the value of not looking like he was playing three-dimensional chess. Hillary\u2019s problem is that she never wants to look like she\u2019s playing tic-tac-toe.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Her appeal is based in part on an assumption of supreme competence on her part: It makes sense of both her Tracy Flick-ish arrogance and her capacity for self-preservation. It\u2019s why people think she would make a good president but also why they believe she would make an explicit \u201cdeal\u201d with Bill to stay married\u2014a thing that happens on soap operas but is emotionally impossible unless you\u2019re a real psychopath. People think of Clinton conspiracy theorists and Clinton loyalists as being in opposite camps when to this extent they are really flip sides of the same steely, calculating coin.\n\nHer protestations that her private email was the same kind of quotidian detritus you and I might send\u2014social plans, white/gold dress jokes, and Paleo brownie recipes\u2014ring hollow because of the ruthless and/or dedicated (depending on your party ID) demeanor she works hard to maintain.\n\nWe can\u2019t quite believe Hillary has a private life in the way you and I do. Because she doesn\u2019t want us to think she does.\n\nBill Clinton knew the value of not looking like he was playing three-dimensional chess. Hillary\u2019s problem is that she never wants to look like she\u2019s playing tic-tac-toe.\n\nTake her weirdly sterile accounting of what passes for apparently significant chunks of 30,000 \u201cprivate, personal\u201d emails: \u201cE-mails about planning Chelsea\u2019s wedding or my mother\u2019s funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been through both a wedding and a funeral recently enough that those details alone could generate a few thousand notes\u2019 worth of an e-trail. Vacations? Also logistically complex! But how many condolences could she possibly have sent? And \u201cyoga routines\u201d? Perhaps that was tacked on to humanize her\u2014yoga is very popular!\u2014but instead it throws up a mental roadblock, because WTF, emailing \u201cyoga routines\u201d?\n\nHillary Clinton does yoga? Hillary Clinton does enough yoga that emails about it make up a memorable portion of 30,000 emails? Instead of coming across as normal, something Joe and Jane Kitchen Table can identify with, it reads as a blurry focus-group memory, perhaps something an aide added to the mix in the scramble to put a statement together. \u201cWe need something besides \u2018condolences\u2019! Something that says, \u2018I also do things not related to death!\u2019\u201d\n\nIt is much easier to imagine, for all the wrong reasons, Bill Clinton sending around multiple emails about \u201cyoga routines.\u201d That Bill doesn\u2019t actually use email is, on the whole, probably something the Hillary not-campaign should be thankful for\u2014even if it does raise even more questions about the content of her non-wedding, non-funeral, non-travel, non-yoga correspondence.\n\nPersonally, I take her at her word that she probably carried only one device, and used only one email, because it was easier. But it couldn\u2019t have escaped anyone in her circle\u2019s attention that such a setup also would make sifting out \u201cpersonal\u201d material from the dragnet of mandated recordkeeping easier.\n\nNonetheless, I can\u2019t quite push it to the third dimension of chess because any really masterful, intentional plan for diverting super-secret, incriminating emails would a) have enlisted more competent security advisers (or a security adviser, period); and b) not hinged on using the domain \u201cclintonemail.com,\u201d which seems like an improbably stupid place to keep super-secret, incriminating email. (Was her password \u201cpassword,\u201d too?)\n\nYet I suspect that the reason this scandal won\u2019t hurt her is that I\u2019m in the minority. She\u2019s the rare politician to benefit from the assumption of Underwoodian skills. She\u2019ll survive it not because people believe she made a human mistake but because they think she\u2019s not quite human, not quite real. She\u2019s all but fictional. The alternative is that she\u2019s capable of the same dumb mistakes as the rest of us, and that\u2019s as hard for her to admit as it is for us to believe.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:01.345+0000"}
{"entityId": 1585, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "A new book from conservative intellectual Shelby Steele claims to offer new answers to the old problems of polarization, but offers the same critique\u2014blame liberals.\n\nShelby Steele calls his new book Shame. You bet it\u2019s a shame. It\u2019s a shame that as often as conservatives pose valuable questions about America\u2019s past, the state of the nation, and, yes, what makes America exceptional, they continually afford us valueless, if not insidious, answers\u2014answers that suppress the story of the making of American democracy, ignore the accelerating concentration of power and wealth, and deny America\u2019s historic purpose and promise. And sadly, in his new book, the renowned black conservative intellectual Shelby Steele does just that.\n\nA Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, a recipient of the National Humanities Medal, and the author of several books, including the award-winning 1990 title, The Content of Our Character: A New Vision of Race in America, in which Steele rightly asked, What happened to the promise of the 1960s\u2014 the promise of the civil rights movement, the victories for freedom, equality, and democracy registered in the 1964 Civil Rights and 1965 Voting Rights acts, and the initiatives of the Great Society and War on Poverty? He even led me to believe that he had critical and compelling things to say\u2014things that might help us talk together about the pressing crises of the day from Ferguson to New York and D.C.\n\nIn the very first chapter of Shame, Steele offers a seemingly heartfelt lament that American public life since the \u201960s has turned into a politics of tribalism in which left and right have their own cultural bases, communications media, and award systems, in which liberals have the universities, NPR, The New York Times, and MacArthur grants, and conservatives have think thanks, talk radio, The Wall Street Journal, and the Bradley Prizes (and he might well have added that liberals have the presidency and conservatives, the Congress). As he writes: \u201csince the 1960s, \u2018liberal\u2019 and \u2018conservative\u2019 have come to function almost like national identities in their own right. To be one or the other is not merely to lean left or right\u2014toward \u2018labor\u2019 or \u2018business\u2019\u2014within a common national identity; it is to belong to a different vision of America altogether, a vision that seeks to supersede the opposing vision and to establish itself as the nation\u2019s common identity.\u201d\n\nIndeed, I began to imagine that Steele was going to offer a serious historical argument about how we got here, how we might start to transcend what he himself calls \u201cThe Great Divide,\u201d and how we might act to renew America\u2019s promise. At the least, I expected he would attend honestly and critically to the developments of the past 50 years\u2014a half-century in which, following world-historic democratic advances at home and abroad, we Americans have suffered not just the return of gross \u201cGilded Age\u201d class inequalities and racially-based urban riots, but also concerted efforts to constrain workers from organizing, low-income minority citizens from exercising their voting rights, and women from controlling their own bodies. But I was wrong.\n\nTaking to the very warpath he seemed to want us to avoid, Steele accuses \u201cliberalism\u201d of creating a political and economic order that not only has failed to fulfill the promise of the \u201960s, but, even worse, has subjected minorities to a new, apparently-benevolent but fundamentally evil \u201cwhite paternalism.\u201d\n\nSteele is an undeniably good writer. His earlier works, whatever we might think of his intellectual politics, provocatively challenged the prevailing political correctness and sharpened the thinking of all of us. And at places in this new book he does not fail to say interesting, at times moving, and even, at other times, entertaining things. I particularly \u201cenjoyed\u201d the story he uses to open the book\u2014the story of his participation in a weeklong conference on race and politics at the Aspen Institute, the liberal elite\u2019s intellectual playground in Colorado.\n\nAsked, along with his fellow panelists, to prepare a response to the question \u201cWhat do you want most for America,\u201d Steele apparently upset the assembled folk by saying that he wanted \u201can end to white guilt.\u201d It\u2019s not that he was absolving present-day whites of racism. Rather, as he goes on to relate, \u201cI then used my allotted few minutes to define white guilt as the terror of being seen as racist\u2014a terror that has caused whites to act guiltily toward minorities even when they feel no actual guilt. My point was that this terror\u2026 has spawned a new white paternalism toward minorities since the 1960s that, among other things, has damaged the black family more profoundly than segregation ever did.\u201d In fact, he insisted, this \u201cbenevolent paternalism of white guilt had injured the self-esteem, if not the souls, of minorities in ways that the malevolent paternalism of white racism never had.\u201d Finally, he relates how his words incited a young white man to stand forth and implore everyone not to believe what they had just heard: \u201cHe wanted to reassure them that blacks were still suffering \u2026 that racism, discrimination, and inequality were still alive\u2014still great barriers to black advancement.\u201d As Steele remembers it, his own remarks had \u201cthreatened [the Aspen crowd] with a kind of moral disgrace.\u201d\n\nAs much as Steele\u2019s provocation of the rich tickled me\u2014though I think they were probably looking to be provoked, for why else would they have invited him, a famous black conservative, to their retreat?\u2014he would soon disappoint me. Instead of trying to break new ground as some conservative intellectuals have recently sought, or at least purported, to do, Steele ends up offering a new, no less nasty, rendition of a story we have heard incessantly for more than 50 years from right-wing figures ranging from Ronald Reagan to Rush Limbaugh: that liberalism is responsible for nearly everything that has gone wrong in America since the \u201960s. Note that I say \u201cliberalism\u201d and not \u201cliberals,\u201d because Steele himself essentially reifies the politics and ideas of liberalism into a faceless god-like force. Rarely does he cite any politicians or writers or their words. And when he does refer to a liberal or progressive figure, he misrepresents them\u2014as he does with the ideas and labors of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nMaking nothing of 200 years of democratic struggles from the bottom up, Steele reduces the goals of the \u201ccivil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s\u201d to \u201cclassical Jeffersonian liberalism\u2014that liberalism which sought freedom for the individual above all else.\u201d Without question that great and forceful founding ideal was fundamental to the cause. But the postwar movement and campaigns for racial justice entailed more than the pursuit of 18th-century liberalism. Steele not only makes no mention of the struggles, advances, and legacies of the New Deal \u201930s and World War II fight for the Four Freedoms pursued by Americans in all their diversity. Even worse, he utterly ignores the fact that King was a democratic socialist who campaigned both for black and minority civil and political rights, and for economic justice and the rights of working people and the poor of every color. Never forget that the 1963 March on Washington organized by socialist black labor leader A. Phillip Randolph, with the active support of UAW leader Walter Reuther, at which King delivered his famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, was a \u201cMarch for Jobs and Freedom.\u201d\n\nOf course, I should have seen it coming. But I had hoped, rather naively, that Steele intended his Aspen Institute tale to introduce something other than one more over-the-top assault on liberalism. After all, he proceeds directly from that story to his lamentation over America\u2019s prevailing political tribalism\u2014a lamentation that seemed to position him to chastise left and right alike: \u201cWhen we let nationalism shape the form of our liberal or conservative identities\u2014when we practice our ideological leaning as if it were a divine right, an atavism to be defended at all cost\u2014then we put ourselves on a warlike footing.\u201d Reading that allowed me to hope that he was going to treat how the powers that be, both liberal and conservative, were culpable for jeopardizing America\u2019s historic purpose and promise.\n\nBut forget it \u2026 Taking to the very warpath he seemed to want us to avoid, Steele accuses \u201cliberalism\u201d of creating a political and economic order that not only has failed to fulfill the promise of the \u201960s, but, even worse, has subjected minorities to a new, apparently-benevolent but fundamentally evil \u201cwhite paternalism.\u201d Determined to sustain its political and cultural hold on America, liberalism, he charges\u2014without presenting us with any solid historical evidence\u2014has fostered, in the wake of the transformative \u201960s and the shattering of America\u2019s traditional narrative, an ideology of anti-Americanism that portrays the United States as \u201ccharacterologically evil\u201d (racist, sexist, imperialist), denies American greatness, goodness, and exceptionalism, and inculcates in minority Americans a world view that obscures the changes and opportunities afforded by the victories of the \u201960s and burdens and disempowers them by imbuing them with grievances instead of challenges. That damn liberalism: \u201cSuperficially it is very \u2018caring\u2019 towards blacks, minorities, and the poor,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt befriends them, promises them all manner of programs and policies. It makes a show of being deferential toward their woundedness, of bowing before their past victimization as before an irrefutable moral authority. But, of course, all this deference is seduction. The new liberalism does not pursue the actual uplift of minorities and the poor. It pursues dispensation from America\u2019s past sins for whites\u2014the imprimatur of innocence.\u201d\n\nAnd guess what? Having indicted liberalism for waging a \u201cculture war\u201d that has not only served to divide Americans into political tribes, but also to wed \u201cthe formerly oppressed\u201d to a sense of themselves as still very much oppressed, Steele directs our attention to a new \u201cpolitics of idealism,\u201d \u201cthe new counterculture,\u201d which, you got it, is contemporary conservatism: \u201ca faith in free market capitalism, smaller government, higher educational standards, the reinforcement of family.\u201d\n\nCome on: Free market capitalism? Assuming there is such a thing as a free market, haven\u2019t we suffered enough of it these past several years? Smaller government? Who among us wants to give up the hard-won democratic programs of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare, Environmental Protection, Workplace Safety, Consumer Protection, etc., etc., etc. \u2026 And in the face of overwhelming and engrossing corporate power, who really wants to reduce the countervailing power of democratic government?\n\nEnough with the political questions. Let\u2019s consider the history that Steele ignores. For a start, he ignores the fact that American greatness depended not simply on a commitment to Jeffersonian liberalism but also on public action and largesse from the days of the 19th-century Homestead Act to those of the New Deal, with its the CCC, WPA, PWA, REA, and NYA, to the Second World War GI Bill, all of which not only built or rebuilt the nation, but also built or rebuilt generations of working Americans. Hell, the real tragedy of liberalism\u2019s War on Poverty was that it wasn\u2019t big enough and did not do enough. Just think of how successful LBJ\u2019s initiatives might have been had they included a serious effort to create public works and employment for black young people\u2014not to mention, if he had refused to pursue the war in Vietnam, which drained resources from the War on Poverty.\n\nFurthermore, while Steele insists that liberalism has won the culture war and that we are all the worse for it, our minority fellow citizens especially, he makes absolutely no mention of the right and corporate rich\u2019s continuing 40-year-long top-down war on popular democracy\u2014a class war from above that has succeeded in destroying American industries, undermining the nation\u2019s infrastructure, devastating middle-class communities and widening class inequality, and sending millions of Americans into the ranks of the working poor.\n\nBut let\u2019s not leave it at that, for while Steele does not do what I hoped he would, he has essentially challenged liberals and leftists to think anew about American exceptionalism. And whether or not we have all denied, disdained, or disparaged the idea as Steele claims, we have clearly allowed conservatives to lay hold of it, tell a story about it, and dictate its meaning. And doing so, they have used it not only to lambaste the left, but also limit American memory and imagination. In short, those of us who want to create a more democratic America must recover and reassert the original radical, indeed revolutionary, meaning of American exceptionalism.\n\nThe Founders\u2014not just the likes of Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Adams, and Hamilton, but all the more Thomas Paine\u2019s people, American artisans, farmers, and laborers\u2014projected the United States as a grand experiment in democracy. By their words and actions, they articulated America\u2019s historic purpose and promise. For all of their terrible faults and failings, they envisioned, demanded, and made real the ideals of freedom, equality, and democracy. And when ensuing generations of Americans confronted crises that placed the nation and its historic purpose and promise in jeopardy, they felt that democratic imperative and impulse and found it in themselves\u2014led by Lincoln and FDR, respectively\u2014to confront and prevail over their enemies not by suspending or abandoning the nation\u2019s finest ideals, but by advancing them.\n\nSteele and his fellow conservatives do not want us to remember that history, that purpose and promise, that exceptionalism. And so far, contrary to Steele\u2019s contentions, they\u2014with the deference, if not collusion, of all too many moderates and liberals\u2014are actually winning not just the class war, but also, in a most critical way, the culture war, as well.\n\nSteele had an opportunity to make a critical difference. But if he truly wants to do that he needs to rethink American history as much as do many of my fellow leftists.\n\nHarvey J.

And they are wrestling with scenarios about how and when he is going to fade or go away. The problem is they are leaning on history and conventional wisdom as their crutch. And Trump is turning out to be a crutch kicker.\n\nDonald Trump is not going away any time soon. In fact, he may be here to stay. Here\u2019s why.\n\nVoters have become completely disillusioned with politics because they have been let down so many times.\n\nThey don\u2019t believe a word any politician says anymore. And they don\u2019t really care what the outcome of the elections are because they don\u2019t think anyone will keep their word anyway. Voters are at the Network threshold: They\u2019re mad as hell, and they\u2019re not going to take it anymore.\n\nSo what better way to express their disgust with the system than to take a very large and sharp stick and poke it in the eye of the body politic. And that stick is Donald Trump.\n\nIf there is one thing Donald Trump amplifies and exemplifies more than anyone imaginable, it is utter contempt for the establishment status quo.\n\nWhen Trump\u2019s support strengthened after the first debate, contrary to what many thought would happen, including me, that\u2019s when I knew we were in new territory. But, it also reminded me of what we always believed during the Bush campaigns: attributes are more important than issues, and the most important attribute is perception of being a strong leader (followed by trust and shared values).\n\nSo who or what is going to take Trump down?\n\nUnlike other candidates who, in recent years, pushed to the top of polls but then faded because they just didn\u2019t have the money to sustain their flight, Trump can stay in the air refueling forever.\n\nJeb Bush and Carly Fiorina are throwing some roundhouse punches. And presumably, a crushing weight of Super PAC attack ads will start falling on Trump.\n\nSure, the collective beating up will have an impact. Ben Carson may win Iowa. Some other candidate may win New Hampshire. But the reality is that there are a large percentage of voters out there who don\u2019t care that Donald Trump hasn\u2019t been, or isn\u2019t, a solid and consistent conservative.\n\nThey don\u2019t even care that they themselves don\u2019t agree with some of his positions. These voters are still going to see Trump as the guy with the big brass clankers who is brash and independent enough\u2014self-funding and therefore not relying on any special interest money\u2014that he is the one and only guy who will create real heartburn for the status quo.\n\nAnd Trump has money to burn. So unlike other candidates who, in recent years, pushed to the top of polls but then faded because they just didn\u2019t have the money to sustain their flight, Trump can stay in the air refueling forever.\n\nSo what\u2019s going to happen?\n\nSmart people like Bill Clinton, Stuart Stevens, and Nate Silver believe Trump will flame out. And that could very well happen. As Silver points out, history suggests an eventual demise for Trump.\n\nBut that\u2019s the thing about politics: Conventional wisdom gets thrown out the door all the time. And has there ever been a more unconventional presidential candidate than Trump? The weakness of the \u201cTrump fades\u201d theory is that that would mean the voters supporting Trump get un-mad. Or, they find someone else who channels their anger better than Trump, though it\u2019s hard to imagine who that could be.\n\nSo I think it\u2019s possible voters have hit their pain threshold and will generate enough heat to keep the Trump flame burning for a long time. More likely than not, Trump actually does go the distance, probably not getting the nomination, but gathering enough delegates that he has to be reckoned with at the convention.\n\nOr, how about this wild scenario: Trump actually starts to get enough delegates to win the nomination. Then, irony of ironies, rather than Trump running as a third party, the GOP establishment decides to pull a Roosevelt, and re-creates the Republican Party under an independent banner.\n\nAnd (1) because all the candidates currently running pledged at the main-stage debate to support the nominee of the GOP (though certainly not binding), and (2) because it would difficult and messy to choose among the Republicans running, and (3) because those running would be out of money, the obvious choice to step in and save the day as the independent candidate would be\u2014drum roll\u2014Mitt Romney.\n\nBottom line, one way or the other, at the end of this election, there will likely be a Trump factor that affects the outcome. Because he\u2019s waving the one-finger salute at Washington at a time when that is exactly the message much of America wants to send.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:02.051+0000"}

PunditFact calls them on it.\n\nBy Jon Greenberg and Katie Sanders\n\nWith Hillary Clinton making her presidential run official, Republicans from Mitt Romney to Kentucky Senator Rand Paul jumped at the chance Sunday to revisit Clinton\u2019s biggest controversies from her tenure as secretary of state.\n\nWe fact-checked claims from both Republicans.\n\nWe\u2019ll take Romney first. On Fox News Sunday, Romney said Clinton deleted emails that were subject to review by Congress.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen in polls and in discussions across the country a feeling that Hillary Clinton is just not trustworthy,\u201d Romney said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cThis whole story about her having erased all of her emails even though they were subject to recall and review by Congress, I think that\u2019s made people remember that with the Clintons it\u2019s always something.\u201d\n\nThat claim rates Mostly False.\n\nRomney\u2019s claim contains two errors. First, Clinton did not erase all her emails.\n\nIn March, the public learned that instead of using a State Department email account when she was in charge, Clinton conducted email through a private server in her New York home. When State Department officials asked for copies of her government-related emails late last year, Clinton\u2019s staff went through her files and sent over about 30,000 emails. According to Clinton, about an equal number of emails were judged to be personal and were erased.\n\nRomney\u2019s second mistake is using the phrase \u201crecall and review by Congress.\u201d\n\nCongress plays no role at all in deciding what materials should be preserved when an official leaves office, said Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and Reath and a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\n\u201cThis is an executive branch function,\u201d Baron said. \u201cIn most agencies when a senior official leaves, there is a protocol to review the documents that the official might have. The Federal Records Act doesn\u2019t expect Congress to review anything.\u201d\n\nCongress does have the right to subpoena records as part of an investigation, and congressional committees have been investigating the deaths at the American compound in Benghazi, Libya. This might be what Romney had in mind. But if he did, that makes his point even harder to prove.\n\n\u201cClinton has stated that she turned over to the State Department any records responsive to congressional subpoena at the time,\u201d said Douglas Cox, a law professor who specializes in government records law at the City University of New York. \u201cAn allegation that she destroyed records subject to subpoena is a serious one, and it is speculative absent more specific evidence.\u201d\n\nPaul, meanwhile, was asked on CNN for an example of Clinton being successful as secretary of state. He answered by pointing out her failure in Libya.\n\n\u201cI think really that the issue in Benghazi is an enormous issue because it\u2019s the one, as commander-in-chief, she would be there for the 3 a.m. phone call. I think Benghazi was a 3 a.m. phone call that she never picked up,\u201d Paul said.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t\u2014she didn\u2019t provide the security, not just that day, for nine months. Dozens and dozens of requests for more security, all completely ignored by Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nThat claim rates Half True.\n\nPaul\u2019s claim that Clinton herself ignored a litany of security requests for the Benghazi outpost does not completely check out, though it is true that the U.S. diplomats in Libya had warned of insufficient protection and the deteriorating climate in eastern Libya in the months ahead of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens\u2019s death.\n\nThe accuracy of his claim comes down to this: There is no hard proof that Clinton \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of requests for more staffing.\n\nStill, there is smoke.\n\nClinton\u2019s reason for not responding to requests from U.S. diplomats in Libya outlining the need for enhanced security staffing was simple: The requests did not make it up to her through the chain of command, she has said.\n\nTo critics like Paul, Clinton assumes responsibility for what went wrong during her four years at secretary of state regardless of whether she was informed.\n\n\u201cDid the State Department, under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s leadership, deny the request for additional security? The answer is yes,\u201d said Paul spokesman Eleanor May.\n\nExperts say we may never know what Clinton knew about the security shortfalls in Benghazi, which officials envisioned as a temporary outpost to monitor eastern Libya\u2019s nation-building efforts after the collapse of the Muammar Gadhafi regime.\n\nPaul may also be overstating by saying there were dozens and dozens of requests for security, experts told us. We found several examples, but not as many as Paul suggested Sunday.\n\n\u201cI would be suspect of anyone making firm conclusions one way or another,\u201d said Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist and expert in Middle Eastern affairs at the RAND Corporation.\n\nAaron Sharockman contributed to this report.

{"entityId": 1588, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "After Michael Brown and Eric Garner, it\u2019s up to House and Senate Republicans to reform our criminal justice system. And surprisingly enough, they just might do it.\n\nAlexis de Toqueville noticed something interesting about the French Revolution: the spirit of rebellion was most intense in regions where the standard of living was rising, not falling. The idea of a revolution of rising expectations was revived in the decolonization era after World War II and during the civil rights movement in the United States. When certain conditions improved for African-Americans, they mobilized around the knowledge that others had not.\n\nWe may be entering a similar period now. No one even half-awake believed the election of the first black president would transform race relations in the United States, but Obama\u2019s 2008 victory did spark a series of expectations, many of which Obama himself knew were unrealistic. Most blacks didn\u2019t blame Obama for falling short; they know racial abuses in the criminal justice system are deeply embedded in American history. But his presence in office heightened frustration over those abuses, and the explosion of social media after Ferguson, which was initially ignored by the mainstream media, is shining a harsher light on them.\n\nBeing reminded that economic and social conditions are not improving at the pace one expected can be a powerful motivator. We\u2019ll see how powerful next weekend in Washington, where the Rev. Al Sharpton and others have planned a huge march. Sharpton, a big Obama supporter, says that so far he thinks the president has responded well; better than President Bill Clinton did in 1999 when Amadou Diallo, an unarmed Haitian immigrant, died in a hail of 41 bullets fired by New York police officers. The onus, Sharpton argues, is now on Congress to act.\n\nThere\u2019s surprisingly little criticism of the march, perhaps because smarter Republicans can feel the tectonic plates of American politics shifting beneath their feet. Even the increasing identification of this issue as \u201ccriminal justice,\u201d not \u201ccrime,\u201d is an indication of how the terrain is changing. Several conservative commentators on Fox News took care to distinguish between the Ferguson case, where they believed the word of police officer Darren Wilson, and the videotaped chokehold that caused the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island, which at least some believed should have resulted in an indictment.\n\nThere was plenty of outrage over the looting in Ferguson in late November, but also a greater recognition than in the past\u2014even on Fox\u2014that it was the work of a small number of knuckleheads and not to be conflated with the mass of protesters gathering around the country. When the grand jury refused to indict in the Garner case, not many conservatives rushed to the microphones to defend the killing of a man pleading \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!\u201d\n\nThe broader issue is also playing out without the usual toxicity. Rand Paul has won freshness points in the early 2016 handicapping by talking repeatedly about de-incarceration, as several Republican governors have for the last few years. When Hillary Clinton pointed out this week that the United States has five percent of the world\u2019s population but 25 percent of the world prison population, no one on the right took umbrage.\n\nWe need to focus our energy, anger and instinct for justice on the great cause of prosecutorial reform.\n\nSo will anything really change? The legislative question is whether the Republicans about to take control of Congress can swallow hard and support the president\u2019s newly-announced law enforcement package, which contains $75 million for a program to give about 50,000 body cameras to state, county and local police departments. This would outfit less than one tenth of police officers nationwide but gets the idea circulating. Once prosecutors realize that body cams help them win cases (not to mention convincing guilty suspects to plead out and avoid an expensive trial), more of them might come around to a position now embraced by everyone from Sharpton to Sean Hannity.\n\nIt\u2019s up to the press to move body cams from a narrow third-tier issue asked only of police chiefs and members of the Judiciary Committee into something asked of all politicians. That\u2019s harder when there\u2019s no real disagreement. Common sense, uncontroversial ideas tend to languish when attention has moved elsewhere.\n\nObama has appointed a task force to report back in 90 days on how to improve police tactics, demilitarize police departments and institute other reforms. It has the potential to be as important as Herbert Hoover's 1931 Wickersham Commission, which led to legislation reforming Prohibition enforcement and barring \"the third degree\" -- the torturing of suspects by police wielding rubber hoses that was common in the back of station houses throughout the country.\n\nThe task force will also likely highlight the need to videotape all police interrogations, an idea pioneered by then-Illinois state senator Obama in the 1990s. But to be historic, the commission should address the underlying structural problem of almost all potential prosecutions of police officers.\n\nAs critics have argued for years, the investigation and prosecution of police officers contains an inherent conflict-of-interest. The same DAs and assistant DAs who depend on cops every day to gather evidence and testify should not be asked to turn around and prosecute their friends and colleagues. Even the most scrupulous prosecutor on the planet cannot do so with the required impartiality and detachment.\n\nAfter the Justice Department last week announced a civil rights investigation into Garner\u2019s death, the 20th such federal probe of a police department launched by Attorney General Eric Holder in the last five years, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, soon to be the second-ranking member of the Senate, asked: \u201cWhy does the federal government feel like it is its responsibility and role to be the leader in an investigation in a local instance?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a question that the Republicans who will now dominate state and local politics in broad swaths of the country answer by saying that Washington has no such role. Should a Republican be elected president in 2016, many of those 20 Justice Department investigations would be wrapped up quickly.\n\nThe challenge is to square that federalist impulse with the need to address the blatant conflict-of-interest that is undermining confidence in fair, colorblind law enforcement.\n\nIt seems to me the answer is a short federal statute requiring the states, under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to remove the investigation and prosecution of police officers from local county prosecutors by any means they see fit. Keep it super-simple from Washington. Then governors, state legislators and prominent members of the bar\u2014many of whom have appointed independent prosecutors before--can figures out how to institutionalize such appointments (usually of prosecutors from other counties, with limits on their investigations), or change state law to allow for open preliminary judicial hearings instead of closed grand juries.\n\nI\u2019m not na\u00efve enough to believe this will pass any time soon. It\u2019s hard enough just to get legislation requiring local police to provide accurate statistics on the death of suspects in custody. But that doesn\u2019t mean we should stop trying to use the new sense of urgency on this issue to nudge state action.\n\nIdeologically, Republicans should embrace the idea, which would apply to the 500 to 1000 cases each year (I told you the numbers were vague) where police officers kill someone in the line of duty. It lets conservatives seem responsive without giving more power to the Justice Department. Police and prosecutors, eager to protect their cozy relationship, would almost certainly use their lobbies to oppose it, though it\u2019s hard to see what their argument would be. But mayors generally favor ways to reduce political heat with independent probes. And it would let governors show leadership in explosive, highly-publicized cases. If Gov. Jay Nixon had removed the Michael Brown case from St. Louis County DA Robert McCulloch, the fallout would have been significantly reduced.\n\nEven without a federal statute, the Justice Department should incentivize states to enact their own laws by saying bluntly that the likelihood of a federal civil rights investigation will be lessened if states mandate the appointment of independent prosecutors in cases involving police departments.\n\nNo law or even revolution in police tactics can fully curb the rising expectations that come with a wired world. That\u2019s good news. We\u2019ve mostly moved past the era where blacks were routinely taken into the back of police stations and roughed up, and eventually\u2014with better training and accountability\u2014we\u2019ll see fewer horrifying video of unarmed people killed by police. But the problem will never end entirely. So we need to focus our energy, anger and instinct for justice on the great cause of prosecutorial reform.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:03.106+0000"}

But don\u2019t expect conservative voters to rally to Grimes\u2014they simply aren't getting behind McConnell.\n\nAlthough the five-term Republican ended up winning a a tough primary challenge from businessman Matt Bevin handily, the race was one of the most vicious and ugly this cycle, with Bevin\u2019s campaign badly damaged in a cockfighting scandal. And while some disaffected conservatives have backed McConnell in November, Bevin has still not endorsed him, and many of the Tea Party groups that supported the businessman are following suit. As a result, in a recent poll, nearly 20% of self-identified Republicans didn't support McConnell\n\nScott Hofstra, spokesman for the United Kentucky Tea Party, said he isn\u2019t backing McConnell and \u201ctaking the lesser of the two evils approach.\u201d Many conservatives, Hofstra predicted, either will leave the box on the ballot for U.S. Senate empty or will vote for David Patterson, the libertarian candidate. The senator has alienated many Tea Partiers and has yet to reach out to bridge the gap, Hofstra said. The divide was opened further, he added, by McConnell\u2019s open support for Thad Cochran in the Mississippi Senate runoff and McConnell\u2019s association with pro-Cochran ads that many conservatives assailed as race-baiting. \u201cIf there were some people on the fence after what happened in Kentucky, the Mississippi incident really put them over the edge,\u201d Hofstra said. Still, he noted that Tea Party dissatisfaction with McConnell wasn\u2019t winning Grimes their votes. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to anybody who would vote her.\u201d\n\nAndrew Schachtner, president of the Louisville Tea Party and a former Bevin campaign staffer, sounded somewhat more restrained than Hofstra in his comments to The Daily Beast. He said his group \u201cwas focusing on state and local issues\u201d instead of the Senate race. In particular, he said, the Louisville Tea Party was prioritizing a local state house candidate to help Republicans gain control of the Kentucky House of Representatives. As for the McConnell-Grimes race, Schachtner said he had decided whom he would vote for but declined to disclose that candidate\u2019s identity.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Grimes who stands to benefit from Tea Party doubts about McConnell. Patterson, a policeman from the central Kentucky town of Harrodsburg, is seeking to get on the ballot as the Libertarian candidate. A recent poll put Patterson at 7 percent in the race and poised to be a spoiler. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Patterson said he felt confident that his team would get the necessary signatures and noted that he was already preparing in advance for any legal challenge.\n\nAlthough McConnell has had a slight edge over Grimes in recent polls, most political observers consider the race a tossup, and it looks likely to be tight through Election Day.\n\nBut Patterson said that at the moment he is not directly appealing to disaffected Tea Partiers. While he said his campaign \u201cwill definitely appeal to those\u2026who are absolutely fed up with the way McConnell has been voting in D.C.,\u201d the Libertarian was aiming to attract those voters who feel \u201cdisenfranchised\u201d by the two-party system. While he took pains to say he wasn\u2019t \u201cmodeling his campaign after anybody,\u201d he mentioned Gary Johnson\u2019s presidential campaign as a possible inspiration: \u201cmore fiscally conservative than the Republicans and more socially accepting than the Democrats.\u201d\n\nYet despite lingering anger over the primary and the potential appeal of Patterson, some Tea Partiers are rallying around McConnell. Frank Simon of the Tea Party of Kentucky said he is \u201cvery much for McConnell over Grimes\u2026Politics is always the lesser of two evils. McConnell is always much better than Grimes. Grimes is pro-abortion.\u201d But Simon said he couldn\u2019t \u201cspeak for all the Tea Parties.\u201d Instead, his group\u2019s approach is to try \u201cto make friends with people, because that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to survive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to overlook problems that we had before and trying to pull together to survive November.\u201d\n\nSimon said the bulk of his group\u2019s efforts would involve a voter guide that was put out \u201cnot under this organization\u201d but through a political action committee and another organization, which would go out to about 30,000 people. He told The Daily Beast that \u201cunless something unforeseen happens, it will endorse McConnell over Grimes.\u201d The bulk of the voter guides will go out through churches, which is allowed, he said, because it \u201calso gives the pro-abortion endorsements, pro-homosexual endorsements, pro-labor endorsements.\u201d\n\nAlthough McConnell has had a slight edge over Grimes in recent polls, most political observers consider the race a tossup, and it looks likely to be tight through Election Day.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:03.365+0000"}

But that comes too late for the family of an American aid worker killed by ISIS.\n\nPresident Obama has ordered a top-to-bottom review of how the U.S. government tries to win the release of Americans held hostage by terrorist groups overseas, The Daily Beast has learned. The review, which will include a specific emphasis on how the U.S. treats hostages\u2019 family members, follows criticism that current hostage-negotiation operations are plagued by bureaucratic infighting and a lack of leadership, particularly by the White House.\n\nThe review was prompted \u201cas a result of the increased frequency of hostage-taking of Americans overseas,\u201d Christine Wormuth, the undersecretary of Defense for policy and one of the Pentagon\u2019s most senior officials, informed Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) in a letter last week (PDF). Hunter sits on the House Armed Services Committee and has been pressing the administration to do more to free Americans held by ISIS and other terrorist groups. Wormuth said the president had ordered the review \u201crecently,\u201d but she didn\u2019t specify when.\n\nThe parents of Americans murdered by ISIS have criticized the White House for threatening them with potential criminal prosecution if they were to pay a ransom.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, ISIS released its latest video showing the beheading of one of its American captives, Peter Kassig. The group is holding one more American, a 26-year-old woman who was kidnapped in Syria last year while delivering aid to Syrians affected by the country\u2019s civil war. The brutal series of beheading videos has been a persistent reminder that the U.S. faces an implacable enemy, even as it steps up airstrikes on ISIS positions in Syria and Iraq. President Obama took heat for playing a round of golf on Martha\u2019s Vineyard after the first video showing the beheading of journalist James Foley aired in August.\n\nWormuth said the review will include a \u201cspecific emphasis on examining family engagement, intelligence collection, and diplomatic engagement policies.\u201d The emphasis on the families of hostages is particularly noteworthy; the parents of Americans murdered by ISIS have criticized the White House for threatening them with potential criminal prosecution if they were to pay a ransom.\n\nFamily members have also complained that the administration didn\u2019t follow up on leads that they provided about where ISIS might be holding the Americans. Several groups of parents have banded together in efforts to locate their children but say they\u2019ve run up against a wall at the White House. Foley\u2019s parents reportedly told Obama in a phone call after their son was shown murdered that the government had \u201cfailed\u201d him by not trying harder to win his freedom. It was during that phone call that Obama told the Foleys an earlier mission by the military had failed to extract the hostages from Syria.\n\nWhile not overtly acknowledging the complaints of family members and critics of the U.S. bureaucracy, Wormuth said the review would seek to \u201cimprove interagency coordination and strengthen the whole of government approach,\u201d code for putting a stop to turf wars and getting the various corners of the government on the same page. Recent efforts to free ISIS prisoners have put the White House and the State Department at odds with the FBI, which has long sought more creative ways for getting Americans out of terrorists\u2019 clutches, including facilitating ransom payments.\n\nWormuth replied to Hunter after an earlier letter in which he urged the president to put someone in charge of all the government\u2019s efforts to free Americans. In the letter, sent after the video of Foley\u2019s beheading appeared, Hunter said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d that the government is not \u201cadequately pursuing and exhausting opportunities\u201d to bring Americans home.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s goal has always been to use every appropriate resource within the bounds of the law to assist families to bring their loved ones home. In light of the increasing number of U.S. citizens taken hostage by terrorist groups overseas and the extraordinary nature of recent hostage cases, this summer President Obama directed relevant departments and agencies, including the Departments of Defense and State, the FBI, and the intelligence community, to conduct a comprehensive review of how the U.S. government addresses these matters,\u201d said Alistair Baskey, a spokesman for the National Security Council. \u201cWhile we are not in a position to detail every effort or every tool we are using to try to bring American hostages home, we will continue to bring all appropriate military, intelligence, law enforcement, and diplomatic capabilities to bear to recover American hostages.

They\u2019ll all matter a lot less than the economy come 2016.\n\nThanks to Donald Trump, everyone\u2019s favorite reality star, we\u2019re seeing 2008 Republican nominee John McCain\u2019s name in the headlines again. And recollection of what happened in that election is timely, and indeed beneficial, for all of us.\n\n2008 holds two important lessons with regard to 2016 that many presidential candidates are missing: General elections are rarely about what campaigns expect them to be about, and\u2014to borrow a turn of phrase from British soldiers\u2014prior planning prevents pretty piss poor performance.\n\nRemember how the 2008 election was supposed to be all about Iraq? The whole way through the primaries, discussion of that war-torn country and our role there dominated the discussion. Then-Senator Clinton got hammered 24-7 for having voted for the Iraq War, and for refusing to apologize. Then-Senator Obama was attractive to many Democratic primary voters first and foremost because of his stance on Iraq.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Republican field, John McCain ran on the idea of a troop surge in Iraq, openly and readily discussing the possibility of a very long-term presence in the country. Mitt Romney garnered at least a few raised eyebrows with his more withdrawal-happy commentary, and his implicit assertion that a private equity genius would better manage U.S. engagement in Iraq than a certified war hero.\n\nObama and McCain won; Clinton and Romney lost\u2014because, don\u2019t you know, Iraq was what 2008 was all about.\n\nExcept that it wasn\u2019t. As it turned out, 2008 was about a financial meltdown. Voters had to choose between a newbie senator who cultivated an appearance throughout the drama of at least being able to walk and chew gum at the same time, and a national security-oriented leader who, while widely respected, failed to inspire confidence when the financial sector went into freefall.\n\n2016 could easily play out the same way, and candidates should remember the example of 2008 as they proceed with crafting their agendas, seeking out briefings from experts in diverse areas of policy, and campaigning across the country.\n\nRight now, national security topics appear white hot. The Iran deal is in sharp focus, with an apparent deep divide between the administration and Congress. Hillary Clinton is kinda-sorta praising the deal, while several of the Republicans are showing off their hawkish bonafides by promising to nix the deal immediately upon assumption of office. (This itself is an interesting counterpoint to then-candidate Obama\u2019s 2008 pledge to personally meet with the Iranian president during his first year in office, with no preconditions). ISIS, of course, remains a major topic in the news as well.\n\nAnd thanks to Trump, immigration\u2014or at least Trump\u2019s bombastic comments about immigrants\u2014is in the news a bit, too, with several GOP candidates looking to brandish their restrictionist credentials to appeal to the GOP base.\n\nBut there\u2019s a good chance that the 2016 general election, and maybe even the respective primaries, will not be about any of these things (and in any event, let me tell you right now that this election will not be about immigration).\n\nOut there, just beyond the horizon, serious economic challenges appear to be looming. And if they don\u2019t come to the fore by November 2016, they will certainly confront whichever candidate prevails in that contest.\n\nAvoiding driving into a large pothole is not the same thing as flying\u2014something a lot of ordinary American breadwinners would probably tell candidates and policy experts if given the chance.\n\nSome would argue that economic and fiscal issues have not really reduced in importance, or truly faded into the background. This is certainly true for hard-core economic policy wonks, debt-and-deficit haters, and\u2014yes\u2014a lot of average Americans who continue to feel that no matter what the economic data says, their financial circumstances are not improving, or not improving enough. For these voters, the American Dream itself seems in jeopardy.\n\nAnd all this could, of course, get a lot worse. As The Economist noted last month, \u201cthe global economy still faces all manner of hazards\u201d and \u201cfew economies have ever gone as long as a decade without tipping into recession\u2014America\u2019s started growing in 2009.\u201d The best-case scenario is that we have a couple more years before it gets really bad again; the worst-case scenario is that it gets bad sooner, potentially even before we get to November 2016, and that the resources that might typically be deployed to stave off a recession will have been depleted trying to deal with the last one.\n\nThis is, ironically, more possible if there is too much, or too rapid, wage growth; that kind of thing often takes a toll on earnings and corporate value. Earnings announced this month beat expectations, but expectations were also so low that it would have been hard not to beat them. So we may have something of an economic mirage going on here. Avoiding driving into a large pothole is not the same thing as flying\u2014something a lot of ordinary American breadwinners would probably tell candidates and policy experts if given the chance.\n\nIf earnings are not in great shape\u2014estimates beaten or not\u2014that could, of course, contribute to another looming problem, one that has previously been predicted: a rising federal budget deficit. Currently, it sits at nearly as low a level as it did back in June 2008; however, that is not due to any real spending restraint, just better profits and hence more tax revenue paid.\n\nAnd lest anyone forget, just about everyone in Washington, D.C., wants to drive spending higher. President Obama wants to boost both domestic and defense spending, and say \u201cgoodbye\u201d to the restraint measures put in place via the sequester.\n\nRepublicans, who like to pretend we are all for fiscal restraint but typically are just for somewhat less spending than Democrats, want to keep the caps on the domestic side, but raise defense spending. The bottom line: Spending is going to go up, while there\u2019s a good chance that revenue is going to go down (and this is setting aside any real discussion of entitlements).\n\nThat means a bigger deficit, which of course was one of the driving forces behind the first few years of the Tea Party.\n\nThis collectively means that while candidates\u2014or perhaps more accurately, their advisers\u2014may want to focus 100 percent or at least 75 percent of their time talking about Iran, ISIS, what percentage of Mexican immigrants are here to kill people, or any of the other current hot topics, they need to be formulating and at least getting prepared to talk about economic policy.\n\nThis is not because they will definitely have to switch gears to be all economy, all the time, out on the trail, but rather because they might have to. And because if they are elected, history being what it is, and economic cycles being what they are, they almost certainly will have to fix an array of economic problems that are currently out-of-sight, and out-of-mind.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:04.107+0000"}

{"entityId": 1593, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "As the United States becomes more and more disjointed, an increasing number of Americans favors abandoning the Union altogether.\n\nIn his underrated classic The Cousins\u2019 Wars, Kevin Phillips proves something most Americans would not like to contemplate. Rather than just a one-off conflict over slavery, the Civil War was actually the third phase of a massive conflict among British people and their descendants. The English Civil War laid the groundwork for the American Revolution\u2014which, in most states, was a civil war of its own, played out county by county\u2014and the American Revolution laid the groundwork for the U.S. Civil War.\n\nThe patterns of thought shaped through centuries of this ethnic and religious conflict live on, as Scotland\u2019s recent bid for independence reminds us. And here in America, the spirit of secession is gaining strength too. As modern social and cultural forces continue to make most of us more interchangeable, interest in leaving the Union has spread out from coast to coast with remarkable regularity.\n\nAs a rigorous new Reuters poll reveals, at least 19 percent of respondents in America\u2019s eight major regions support the idea of their state \u201cpeacefully withdrawing from the United States of America and the federal government.\u201d In the Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, Plains, and Far West, secession sympathizers top out at 22 percent of the population. In the Southeast, the group counts 1 of every 4 respondents. In the Rockies, the number climbs to 26 percent, and in the Southwest, fully a third are on board.\n\nPerhaps predictably, support is stronger among Republicans than Democrats, and among Tea Party respondents, support for secession hit 53 percent. But those details pale in comparison to the conclusions drawn by Reuters analysts themselves.\n\n\u201cThose we spoke to seemed to have answered as they did as a form of protest that was neither red nor blue but a polychromatic riot,\u201d Reuters\u2019 Jim Gaines explains. Respondents vented their grevances, he wrote, \u201cagainst a recovery that has yet to produce jobs, against jobs that don\u2019t pay, against mistreatment of veterans, against war, against deficits, against hyper-partisanship, against political corruption, against illegal immigration, against the assault on marriage, against the assault on same-sex marriage, against government in the bedroom, against government in general\u2014the president, Congress, the courts and both political parties.\u201d\n\nThese grudges are not new to us. But very few of us have imagined that they could fuel a generalized positive view of secession. We like to think that the Civil War and its aftermath limited secessionism to a narrow, backward, and most of all shrinking population of ingrate Southern nostalgists. What a quaint myth that turns out to be.\n\nWe like to think that the Civil War and its aftermath limited secessionism to a narrow, backward, and most of all shrinking population of ingrate Southern aristocrats. What a quaint myth that turns out to be.\n\nAs Phillips observes, \u201cas late as the 1950s, rural and small-town Americans were still broadly voting as their great-grandfathers had shot.\u201d But the acceleration of the modern forces that made us all more interchangeably similar undid those cross-generational bonds as the 1960s set in. As Phillips puts it, the \u201ccultural, religious, and ethnic quilt of Civil War and post-Civil War politics, four generations old, was finally unraveling,\u201d which led him to predict \u201ca new, dominant, trans-Mason-Dixon line, conservative coalition.\u201d\n\nHe was, to put it mildly, absolutely right. But we are now far behind the years of the Silent Majority, the Reagan Revolution, the Republican Revolution of \u201994, and the George W. Bush administration. Barack Obama has shown America that crony corporatism, patronage politics, and limitless government know no party. Some of us, on balance, are okay with that fact. Others are not\u2014but many of the anxious and jaded would sooner just fade out of civic life than step up to the challenge of secession, with the higher-stakes effort of state and local governance that awaits.\n\nBecause the federal government has become so ubiquitous and voracious, there seems to be no negotiating with its size and scope. The struggles over taxes, budgets, surveillance, incarceration, and related matters have soured Americans on the prospects of methodical, measured reform. Increasingly, the radical alternatives of giving up on politics or giving up on the United States seem like the only alternatives.\n\nAnd the more disconnected we become from the era of the Civil War, the more abstract and plausible the idea of secession becomes. Not only is secession becoming delinked from the memory of the Confederate States; it\u2019s even coming unglued from the national conservative coalition that controlled much of federal politics in the last years of the 20th century. According to Reuters, current Democrat support for secession is hovering around 20 percent.\n\nWhat secessionists forget, however\u2014and what the Reuters poll helped them to ignore\u2014is that quitting the Union will not happen \u201cpeacefully.\u201d Perhaps the most durable lesson of the Civil War is that the states cannot remain united if a handful make a break for the exits. Much of the fervor for war in 1860 was driven by a moral crusade against slavery. Some of it was fueled by patriotism, and some by state, local, and even just family affinities.\n\nAt the highest level, however, Lincoln recognized that the cosmopolitan North\u2014teeming with immigrants, churning with class conflict, surging into the prairie and mountain west\u2014would have lacked a logic of unity if the South were permitted to break off in peace. The Southerners had history, ethnicity, culture, slavery, religion, and a quasi-aristocratic honor society to hold them together.\n\nWhat did the North have?\n\nNot much more than we have today. Although the spell of American superpower and an almighty government is in some ways more dominant than ever, the moment that spell is broken, many will find themselves in a kind of freefall of political principle. Thomas Hobbes, who fled to France during the English Civil War, made a wager that haunts us to this day: without a Leviathan to overawe us all, will we slip swiftly into rancor and chaos?\n\nThe larger the pro-secession minority becomes, the more the majority opposed to secession will believe that Hobbes was right.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:04.713+0000"}
{"entityId": 1594, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Obama is widely believed to tap an ex-physicist who cuts military waste like a laser to become the next secretary of defense.\n\nCall it the revenge of the wonk. After being passed over for Defense Secretary last year while serving as the Pentagon\u2019s No. 2, Ashton Carter, a widely admired manager noted for his knack for wrangling budgets and weapons contracts, left government. It seemed as if he\u2019d never serve in the top slot.\n\nBut now, with Carter\u2019s former boss, Chuck Hagel, having crashed and burned, Obama is widely believed to be ready to nominate the 60-year-old former physicist as the nation\u2019s 25th Defense Secretary. That's despite the fact that Obama appeared to favor another candidate, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, who yesterday asked to be removed from the shortlist, the latest candidate to preemptively decline a job few in Washington seem to want.\n\nBut for Carter, this is a capstone to a career spent in the decidedly unsexy corridors of Pentagon power. He served as deputy secretary of defense from 2011 to 2013, essentially the department\u2019s chief operating officer. But prior to that, he was the under secretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, and oversaw the Pentagon\u2019s efforts to get more efficient, and smarter at amassing its arsenal of weapons. Under Carter\u2019s green eyeshades, the department axed huge weapons programs, including the Army\u2019s $200 billion Future Combat System--a suite of networked trucks and tanks--and he helped to bring costs under control for the Joint Strike Fighter program, the biggest Pentagon weapons system in history.\n\nPart of that was a new rule he instituted that required defense contractors to dip into their profits if their projects went over-budget. \u201cWhen we get to $120\u2033 on a $100 item, Carter said in 2010, \u201cI\u2019m out of Schlitz and it\u2019s all yours.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s tough managerial talk. And while the issues on Carter\u2019s plate now would be of a decidedly more global and political nature--the rise of ISIS, a nationalist Russia, the spread of Ebola--those who know Carter say his bureaucratic smarts and tenacity will serve him well.\n\n\"Whether anyone can ever manage a $650 billion enterprise fighting five low level wars is another story, but he's about as qualified as anyone can get,\" said Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Cordesman noted that Carter gets along well with Sen. John McCain, who's about to take take over the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nCarter also doesn't have a long list of critics.\n\nCarter has also been a fixture on boards and expert panels, in think tanks and at universities. He's about as apolitical as they come in Washington power circles. Yet his policy advice has, at time, been a bit out of tune. In 2006, he called on the U.S. to preemptively attack North Korea when it was on the verge of test-firing a long-range ballistic missile. That advice, thankfully, was ignored. The missile fell back to earth after just 40 seconds in the air.\n\n\"Ash Carter is more of a technocrat\u2026 he's shown over the years that he have strong views, but they're the kind of pragmatic views that are budgetary and policy-oriented,\" Cordesman said. \"As important as policy issues are day to day, making the department work year to year is at least as important.\"\n\nCarter also doesn't have a long list of critics. But his relations with his former Pentagon boss weren\u2019t always so smooth. As Hagel\u2019s #2, Carter did get to sit in on high-level \"principals meetings\" at the White House, even though those confabs are usually meant for cabinet secretaries only. But as Foreign Policy reported last year, some in Hagel\u2019s camp complained that Carter got too big for his britches, talking as if he ran the Pentagon, instead of seriving as Hagel\u2019s deputy.\n\nStill, Carter faces a relatively straightforward confirmation process -- or, as least as close to straightforward as one can get in today\u2019s hyper-politicized Washington. Johnson, who had previously served as the Pentagon's general counsel, risked incurring the wrath of Republican senators opposed to Obama's recent executive action on immigration, which Johnson's department is implementing.\n\nCarter is drama free. Another reason why an embattled president facing withering criticism for his foreign policy, including from members of his own party, may be inclined towards a steady hand and an uncontroversial pick.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:04.873+0000"}

But it\u2019s actually a description of the beginning of the new X-Men blockbuster Days of Future Past\u2014a film that (underneath its comic-book action and time-travel shenanigans) questions the use of military robots and highlights the damage they can inflict on civilians.\n\nOr should I say *another* film.\n\nDays of Future Past is not the only recent Hollywood production to express discomfort with President Barack Obama\u2019s drone program. Last month, Marvel Studios released Captain America: The Winter Soldier\u2014and almost immediately the directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, revealed that their movie was all about \u201ccivil liberties\u2026 drone strikes, the president\u2019s kill list, [and] preemptive technology.\u201d When a RoboCop reboot came out in February, director Jose Padilha described it thusly: \u201cThe movie\u2019s about drones.\u201d Back in 2012, the fourth installment in the Bourne franchise, The Bourne Legacy, featured a sequence in which an American UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) attempted to blow up Jeremy Renner, a CIA superagent hiding out in Alaska. And then there\u2019s Homeland. On Showtime\u2019s hit spy drama, the original sin\u2014the trauma that transformed Marine Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) into an al Qaeda sleeper agent\u2014was a drone strike that accidentally killed an 8-year-old boy he\u2019d befriended in captivity.\n\nAll of which raises an intriguing question: Is the sudden rise of movies (and shows) that criticize drones a mere coincidence? Or is Hollywood\u2014fueled by the revelations of Edward Snowden and Julian Assange and disgusted by years of kill lists and civilian casualties\u2014finally turning against the president?\n\nOnly an obviously corrupt president could take America down this path, they seem to be warning Obama. Don't be that kind of president.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that Obama remains a relatively popular figure in Hollywood. Earlier this month Air Force One touched down in Los Angeles for a quick fundraising and hobnobbing trip: a $64,800-per-couple DNC soiree at the Bel Air home of Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn, an \u201cintimate\u201d $32,400-per-ticket roundtable at the Beverly Hilton, and a Shoah Foundation ceremony at which Bruce Springsteen serenaded the audience and Steven Spielberg presented Obama with an award that christened him an \u201cAmbassador for Humanity.\u201d In 2012, George Clooney raised $15 million for the president\u2019s reelection campaign\u2014at a single event.\n\nYet the movie industry seems to have soured in some ways on a president whose disapproval rating currently averages 51.3 percent\u2014and drone strikes and domestic spying appear to be a big reason why. Last year, former Obama supporter Matt Damon told BET that the president \u201cbroke up\u201d with him, adding that \u201cthere are a lot of things that I really question\u2014the legality of the drone strikes, the NSA revelations.\u201d \u201cObama is becoming the next Nixon,\u201d tweeted actor John Cusack. \u201cWhat is this, North Korea?\u201d asked director Judd Apatow.\n\nNow those sour feelings are showing up on screen. X-Men: Days of Future Past unfolds in two time periods: a dystopian 2023 in which airborne, artificially intelligent military robots known as Sentinels are hunting down and killing mutants, who are seen as a threat to homeland security; and 1973, the year when the Sentinel program was launched by a government contractor named Bolivar Trask\u2014which is also the year Wolverine time-travels back to in order to stop the program before it really gets going. The plot twists and turns, but the movie\u2019s main point\u2014that a nation is laying the groundwork for its own destruction if it targets its own citizens and isn\u2019t careful enough about killing innocents\u2014is just as pertinent right now, in 2014, as it would be in some imaginary postapocalyptic future. There\u2019s a reason, after all, that the filmmakers chose to trace the Sentinels back to 1973, when Richard Nixon was in charge. Only an obviously corrupt president could take America down this path, they seem to be warning Obama. Don\u2019t be that kind of president.\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier, RoboCop, The Bourne Legacy, and Homeland all send a similar message. The Winter Soldier centers on a top-secret S.H.I.E.L.D. (read C.I.A.) project called Project Insight that consists of \u201cthree state-of-the-art drone-like \u2018helicarriers\u2019\u2026 whose long-range weaponry can neutralize threats from a safe, airborne remove\u201d and \u201canalyze data from personal and public records to identify potential hostiles before they materialize.\u201d It\u2019s not spoiling anything to say the film isn\u2019t particularly fond of this program. Likewise, RoboCop is a pretty explicit piece of futuristic political satire that begins with American robot policemen and flying drones killing an innocent child during a suicide-bomb scare in some Middle Eastern country, then goes on to explore whether we as a society should fear anything that has a weapon but lacks a conscience. (Short answer: yes.) The Bourne Legacy, meanwhile, shows a drone attacking an American citizen; Homeland shows a drone turning an American citizen into an enemy of the state\u2014and eventually getting his revenge by killing the vice president.\n\nSo what does this mean for Obama? When asked by Mother Jones why he and his brother decided to make a comic book movie about drones and domestic spying, Winter Soldier director Joe Russo gave a fairly straightforward answer. \u201c[Marvel] said they wanted to make a political thriller,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo we said, \u2018If you want to make a political thriller, all the great political thrillers have very current issues in them that reflect the anxiety of the audience.\u2019\u201d This, of course, is true; some Americans are anxious about Obama\u2019s drone program. But it\u2019s also true that a lot more Americans are a lot more anxious about other things. Polls consistently show that a solid majority of voters support drone strikes\u2014as opposed to, say, Obamacare.\n\nThe real reason Russo & Co. are making movies about drones, then, isn\u2019t that they\u2019re speaking for the rest of America. It\u2019s that they\u2019re speaking for themselves\u2014the sort of Hollywood liberals inclined to think that Obama is too centrist (or even conservative). As Russo himself put it in the interview, to figure out which issues \u201creflect[ed] the anxiety of the audience,\u201d he \u201cjust looked at the issues that were causing anxiety for us, because we read a lot and are politically inclined.\u201d\n\nSo Obama shouldn't be too worried\u2014at least not yet. Hollywood caring about drones is one thing. The question now is whether they can convince the rest of us to care as well.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:05.309+0000"}

Although several farmers agreed that a labor shortage is costing many growers their farms, Broun told them \u201cnothing else matters until the border is secure,\u201d which he said meant stopping \u201cOTMs.\u201d\n\n\u201cOTMs, that means \u201cOther Than Mexicans,\u201d he told me later. \u201cWe have people from the Middle East, from Asia, from all over the world that are coming through the southern border.

By the end of my interview, he had asked for my vote three times and my parents\u2019 votes twice and ducked only one question I asked-- which of the nearby golf courses was his favorite?\n\n\u201cI love to play golf,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t got time.

Why colleagues say America can\u2019t ask for better than Loretta Lynch, the president\u2019s pick to succeed Eric Holder.\n\nThe woman tapped to become the new attorney general is the younger sister of a Navy SEAL from those days before fame and book deals, when America\u2019s foremost warriors were known only as anonymous \u201cquiet professionals.\u201d\n\nLoretta Lynch has taken much the same quietly professional approach as the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Her father can attest to that, having seen her in action in a Brooklyn courtroom. He speaks of her much as he might of his elder son, the SEAL.\n\n\u201cLow-key, soft voice, but hard-punching attorney,\u201d says Rev. Lorenzo Lynch, a fourth-generation Baptist minister from North Carolina. \u201cShe was never a show person but boy she did hit hard.\u201d\n\nHer mother, Lorine Lynch, started life as a farmhand. Loretta Lynch recalled aloud at the swearing-in ceremony for her first stint as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York in 1999 that she once asked her mother why she had labored in the fields.\n\n\u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t have to,\u201d her mother had told her.\n\nThompson described her as a super-smart, fiercely focused, unshakably honest, and supremely fair-minded champion who would make an outstanding attorney general. \u201cWe can\u2019t as a country ask for more than Loretta Lynch.\u201d\n\nThe mother had left the fields to become a librarian and her love of literature passed on to her three children. Neighbors in Durham would marvel at the stacks of books little Loretta and her brothers would carry from the public library just down the street.\n\n\u201cYour books are taller than you are!\u201d the father remembers people exclaiming.\n\nLoretta\u2019s uncommon brightness led to an early encounter with what some took to be racism when she took a standardized test at her largely white public school.\n\n\u201cShe scored so high they said, \u2018This is wrong, you have to retake it,\u2019\u201d the father recalls. \u201cShe retook it and scored higher the second time.\u201d\n\nWhen Loretta was not yet in high school, the family took a trip to Boston and her parents pointed across the Charles River to Harvard University. The father recalls, \u201cShe said, \u2018That\u2019s where I want to go to college.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother encounter with apparent racism came when she finished at the very top of her class at Durham high school. The authorities suddenly decided there had to be three valedictorians, which resulted in one of them being white. She did indeed go to Harvard, where she majored in English and delighted in reading Chaucer in Old English. She proceeded on to Harvard Law School.\n\nFrom there, she joined a big Wall Street law firm and earned a six-figure salary. Her father figured that she was set, even if she more than once arrived to conduct a disposition only for the opposing lawyers to assume she must be the court stenographer.\n\nThen she announced she was taking a 75 percent pay cut to become an assistant U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn. She thereby declared herself less interested in making money than in making a difference.\n\nThe father came up from North Carolina to see her prosecute a Chinese gang. He returned when she took on the Abner Louima case, which was as momentous in 1999 as the Michael Brown case in Ferguson is now. Louima was a Haitian immigrant who was sodomized by a cop with a wood stick in a precinct bathroom. Four other cops were also arrested in connection with the incident\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let these defendants push us back to the day when police officers could beat people with impunity, and arrest people for no reason and lie about it to cover it up,\u201d Lynch told the jury during her closing argument that day in 1999.\n\nThe courtroom was completely silent when she was done.\n\n\u201cYou could hear a pin drop,\u201d the father recalls. \u201cIt was remarkable.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want her prosecuting me.\u201d\n\nSoon afterward, President Clinton appointed her the U.S. attorney for the district, including Queens, Staten Island, and Long Island. She was replaced by President Bush in mid-2001 and she returned to private practice.\n\nIn 2010, President Obama then brought her back for a second stint. She continually impressed her staff with her ability to quickly grasp the essentials of a case as her office wrangled multibillion-dollar settlements from various errant banks while prosecuting a wide range of terrorists, gangsters, and cybercriminals.\n\nIn recent weeks, she has overseen cases involving a dual Kazakh-Israeli citizen charged with money laundering, a man arrested for sexually abusing three girls at an Army base, an attorney convicted of a $5 million fraud, mobsters nabbed for a decade-old murder, a banker who faked his own death, a union delegate sentenced for extorting Christmastime tribute, a doctor collared for illegal distribution of Oxycodone, a scamster who engineered an Alaskan gold-mine investment scheme, another scamster charged with facilitating a $6 million food-stamp fraud, five 7-Eleven franchisees who victimized immigrant employees, a fugitive who got in a shootout with U.S. Marshals, a pharmacist charged with smuggling counterfeit medicines via a Costa Rican Internet distributor, a drug dealer convicted of two contract murders, six corporate executives indicted for orchestrating a $500 million offshore fraud, a man convicted of using stolen Social Security numbers to file thousands of false tax returns, and a civil dispute over a dinosaur fossil\n\nShe has also pressed ahead with the prosecution of Rep. Michael Grimm, who was reelected this week despite being under indictment for lying under oath and allegedly cooking the books of a now-shuttered health-food restaurant. Grimm is a Republican and he charged during the campaign that the prosecution was politically motivated. That suggestion turns absurd when you consider the long list of corrupt Democrat politicians Lynch has sent to prison.\n\nAnd nobody can rightly say that she seeks headlines in the way of too many other prosecutors. Her single and singular goal in every case is to pursue justice as determined by the law.\n\n\u201cI think we should want an attorney general who doesn\u2019t seek the limelight, but seeks justice,\u201d says Ken Thompson, who prosecuted the Louima case with her and has gone on to become the Brooklyn district attorney.\n\nThompson knows her life story and goes on to say, \u201cWhat she represents is the American dream.\u201d\n\nHe believes she would serve as an inspiration and a role model to young people who are beginning their own struggle toward that dream. He described her as a super-smart, fiercely focused, unshakably honest, and supremely fair-minded champion who would make an outstanding attorney general.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t as a country ask for more than Loretta Lynch,\u201d Thompson says.\n\nAccording to numerous reports, the departing attorney general, Eric Holder, agreed. He had already named her the head of his advisory council. And he was said to be urging Obama to appoint her as his successor.\n\nOn Friday, her 82-year-old father was down in North Carolina, remembering that his daughter sneezed in his face when he was carrying her home from the hospital after she was born. She had since been only a delight.\n\n\u201cHighly inquisitive, highly playful, always cheerful,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe would play with anything. She would make a toy out of anything.\u201d\n\nThe father had known tragedy with the death of his son, the former SEAL, when he was just 51. The father now seemed about to know triumph with the nomination of the family\u2019s other quiet professional, 55-year-old Loretta Lynch, as the new attorney general.\n\nIn this age of selfies, the president had chosen someone who never seeks the spotlight and lets her work speak for itself. The father said Friday night that he would wait until he actually sees it happen at the official ceremony in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI would be proud, but my late mother said, \u2018Don\u2019t count your eggs, son, until they hatch,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I see Mr. Obama and my daughter standing beside him, I\u2019ll say something is about to happen.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:06.122+0000"}
{"entityId": 1599, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "They weren\u2019t the most popular guys around Washington. But they all had Clinton\u2019s private email address. And boy, did they use it.\n\nAt 10:03 p.m. on June 23, 2009\u2014five months into Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state\u2014she received an email from Sidney Blumenthal, her longtime, and long-controversial, confidant. The subject: \u201cHillary: If you\u2019re up, give me a call. Sid.\u201d\n\nDuring her early days in the Obama administration, newly released State Department emails show, Clinton received dozens of such messages on her private account from a motley, sycophantic crew of outside advisers\u2014many of whom carried significant baggage from past controversies.\n\nMark Penn, who abruptly resigned in April 2008 as Clinton\u2019s chief presidential campaign strategist, offered his opinions of Obama\u2019s Afghanistan strategy (or lack thereof). Lanny Davis, who counted dictators among his lobbying clients, asked Clinton to raise the issue of a Washington Times reporter held by the Iranians with the Greek foreign minister.\n\nBlumenthal emailed over and over and over again: He sent analysis on Iran, the latest gossip in the U.K., and advice on how to deal with Chinese disrespect for President Obama. At one point, Blumenthal apparently acted as a backchannel between Clinton and U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown.\n\nAt the same time, Clinton\u2019s emails from 2009 illustrate a strange disconnect from the White House she served: a canceled meeting at the White House, finding out about a Cabinet gathering on the radio\u2014and senior White House staff asking for her personal email address.\n\nOf course, the emails, released Tuesday night by the State Department, present just one window into Clinton\u2019s communications and interactions. (It\u2019s the second large-scale release of Clinton\u2019s emails, following the publication in May of hundreds of her communications on the 2012 attacks in Benghazi.) The documents only show declassified emails and exclude phone calls, meetings, and classified communications\u2014none of which we can see.\n\nBut that imperfect window reveals some odd things. Blumenthal, in particular, comes across as the foreign policy equivalent of a late-night drunk texter. The \u201cgive me a call\u201d email is one of many the moonlighting adviser fired off in 2009. Blumenthal sent that message in June, as Clinton was considering whether to bring him onto her State Department staff, an idea the White House eventually nixed. But that didn\u2019t stop the journalist and longtime Clinton loyalist from chiming in on myriad issues and personalities on which he purported to have insider knowledge.\n\nBlumenthal gave Clinton advice on what she ought to say on U.S. policy toward Iran. He passed her a laudatory opinion piece in Foreign Policy magazine, noting there \u201cwill likely soon be other analyses in the same vein as I am led to understand,\u201d without specifying his source.\n\nBlumenthal also pressed Clinton on how she should deal with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and Irish politicians. And he dished gossipy tidbits he was picking up through his personal contacts in the British government.\n\nIn a May email, titled \u201cfrom rome... Sid,\u201d Blumenthal wrote, \u201cI also should relate to you when I return information about [U.K. Prime Minister Gordon] Brown government re foreign ministry.\u201d\n\nIn another email, Blumenthal updated Clinton on the U.K. results for the 2009 European Parliament election. In another, he wrote that \u201cit would seem proper and decent for the President to call Berlusconi to express his concern about his health and wish him a speedy recovery.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal apparently was eager to brag to strangers about how essential he was to the secretary of state. On June 5, 2009, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley wrote Clinton to say Blumenthal had \u201couted himself\u201d about coming to work at the department during a conversation with an Associated Press reporter, \u201cmentioning it without realizing he was talking to someone who actually covers our building.\u201d\n\nMark Penn, Clinton\u2019s widely disliked 2008 campaign strategist, also offered his two cents on foreign policy from time to time.\n\nBlumenthal \u201couted himself\u201d about coming to work at the department during a conversation with an Associated Press reporter, \u201cmentioning it without realizing he was talking to someone who actually covers our building.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell if anyone is listening to Obama at [the United Nations] but the lack of clear Afghanistan policy is unwinding the coalition and threatens to cause a massive deer in headlights problem for administration if not resolved soon,\u201d he wrote in an email on Sept. 24, 2009.\n\nIn October of that year, Penn sent another email, this time criticizing Obama\u2019s action toward the Taliban, calling it \u201cpolitically\u2026quite dangerous.\u201d\n\nWhile Penn has managed a number of overseas political campaigns, his experience in matters of international security is thin. Yet he continued to opine.\n\n\u201cObama maintained througout [sic] the campaign and the start of his presidency that this is the one to fight and backing down here makes him and the administration vulnerable to losing moderate support and seeming weak and indecisive,\u201d he wrote Clinton. \u201cA single terrorist incident would be blamed on the admin. failing to do the job right.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Lanny Davis, the Clinton ally for decades. He knew her at Yale Law and was the chief counsel who dealt with Whitewater and other Clinton tribulations in the 1990s.\n\nIn one email exchange, Davis reached out to Hillary on behalf of John Solomon, then editor of the Washington Times, who was trying to get help for a reporter being held by the Iranians. Davis noted before the request that Solomon had been \u201calways fair to us as AP reporter and later Wash Post reporter.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says Greeks have good relations and he believes they are trying to help. He believes you are meeting with Greek Foreign Minister tomorrow and hopes you can raise the issue with him - he may already know something about it,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cAny information he knows would help family. Hope you can do this - And hope your elbow is better.\u201d\n\nClinton, in turn, sent an email to her State Department aide Jake Sullivan: \u201cWould you pls give Lanny a report and do you know who is keeping Solomon informed?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the newly released communications also reveal a strange detachment between Clinton and the White House.\n\nIn June 2009, Clinton reached out to top aides about a supposed meeting at the White House. \u201cI heard on the radio that there is a Cabinet mtg this am,\u201d she emailed. \u201cIs there? Can I go? If not, who are we sending?\u201d Turns out there was no full Cabinet meeting.\n\nDays later, Clinton arrived at the White House and was told her meeting was canceled, the second time this had occurred.\n\n\u201cI arrived for the 10:15 mtg and was told there was no mtg,\u201d Clinton wrote in an exasperated email to senior aides. \u201cMatt said they had \u2018released\u2019 the time. This is the second time this has happened. What\u2019s up???\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only communication difficulty between the White House and Clinton. While many of Clinton\u2019s outside advisers had her private email, many of the top officials within the administration weren\u2019t able to reach her on it.\n\nIn June 2009, an aide emailed Clinton to say that White House aide David Axelrod was looking for her private address. In September, her chief of staff raised the same issue with Clinton regarding White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel.\n\n\u201cAxelrod wants your email - remind me to discuss with you if i forget,\u201d Cheryl Mills wrote in the subject line of an email to Clinton.\n\nThe emails indicate that famed diplomat Richard Holbrooke, the administration\u2019s point man on Afghanistan and Pakistan, did not have the same access to Clinton enjoyed by outside advisers like Blumenthal. Despite being the most prominent State Department official besides Clinton, it appears that Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s right-hand woman, was his main point of contact when trying to reach the secretary.\n\n\u201cDoes [Holbrooke] have an email address?\u201d Clinton asked an aide in November 2009, 11 months after they both joined the administration.\n\nWhen Clinton broke her elbow in the summer of 2009, both John Podesta and Colin Powell emailed her jokes about Holbrooke tripping her.\n\nPowell, former secretary of state and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote: \u201cHillary, Is it true that Holbrooke tripped you? Just kidding. Get better fast, we need you running around. Good being with you the other evening.\u201d\n\nThe Clintons even appeared to be somewhat reliant on gatekeepers when dealing with each other.\n\n\u201cIf u r still up, wjc landed in brazil for refuel,\u201d Abedin wrote Clinton in June 2009. \u201cHe should be on ground for an hour or so. Call dougs cell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried Doug twice but it went right to voice mail,\u201d Hillary responded at the end of the email chain. (The \u201cDoug\u201d in question is likely then-Bill Clinton aide Doug Band.)\n\nThe former president didn\u2019t even tell his wife when he became the U.N. special envoy to Haiti, instead conveying the news via Band. \u201cWjc said he was going to call hrc but hasn\u2019t had time,\u201d Band wrote to Abedin and Mills after the news of the appointment had already gone public.\n\nThere are also several emails arguing over the substance of the U.S. policy in Afghanistan, often filled with biting criticism and assertions the policy was, as one adviser wrote in a September 24, 2009, email, \u201cunwinding.\u201d\n\nLongtime Clinton advisers addressed efforts to get around the flailing government of then-Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai\u2014by working with Pakistan or striking some kind of deal with the Taliban.\n\nThe implication was they didn\u2019t trust the then newly re-elected president to solve Afghanistan\u2019s intractable problems.\n\nAnd even Clinton had trouble sorting out what the U.S. was supposed to say to Karzai. In a December 28, 2009, email from Clinton titled \u201cKarzai call?\u201d the secretary of state asks: \u201cWhat, if anything, was decided about whether I should call him? The email traffic I read has Holbrooke saying \u2018yes\u2019 and Frank R disagreeing. Can you update pls.\u201d\n\nBy then Obama had delivered a speech at West Point, New York, outlining the U.S. withdrawal plan from Afghanistan. In the email chain, no one has an answer for Clinton on whether she should call the U.S.-backed Karzai.\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by Jackie Kucinich, Nancy A.

{"entityId": 1600, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Before Marco Rubio was a tea party darling, he was a Mike Huckabee fan.\n\nBefore he was a national figure, before he anchored an effort to pass immigration reform, before he began his run for president or Senate: Marco Rubio was a staunch supporter of Mike Huckabee.\n\nThe two politicians are rivals now, but in the 2008 presidential election, a little-known Florida House speaker named Rubio was Huckabee\u2019s biggest cheerleader in Florida.\n\nAnd the former Arkansas governor hasn\u2019t forgotten about it: Huckabee joked at least twice Tuesday that Rubio should reprise the role of his Florida co-chair: once on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, and a second time at an economic summit hosted by Governor Rick Scott in Orlando.\n\n\u201cMarco should be repeating that work again,\u201d said Huckabee emphatically. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t get him to believe that that was his best role.\u201d\n\nBut in January 2008, Huckabee was singing a different tune: \u201cIt\u2019s a nice honor to be introduced by the future governor of Florida, Marco Rubio,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep the seat warm in the White House because I can see him sitting there some day.\u201d\n\nNearly eight years later, Rubio\u2019s endorsement of Huckabee looks especially strange:\n\nWhile Rubio launched his 2016 campaign with an appeal with lofty talk about a new American century, he once endorsed a man who questions evolution.\n\nThen there\u2019s the immigration issue.\n\nRubio is known for his efforts to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill, but he once endorsed a man who called for deporting undocumented immigrants, building a fence along the Mexican border, and fining those who hire employees without work authorization.\n\nTheir approach to politicking couldn\u2019t be more different as well.\n\nWhile Rubio doesn\u2019t often find himself making outlandish statements, Huckabee found himself in hot water (again) after saying this week he wished he could have been transgender in high school so he could have showered with girls.\n\nMaybe it was a marriage of convenience?\n\nIt was clear why Huckabee needed Rubio in 2007: The former Arkansas governor had objected to the Cuban embargo on the basis that it hurt rice farmers in his state. As a national politician trying to contest Florida, Huckabee needed a Cuban American to act as a human shield for criticism of his flip-flop.\n\nFar less clear, however, is what Rubio got out of the deal. Top-tier Republican candidates had courted him, but Rubio had rebuffed them. Even then, it was puzzling.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a nice Cuban-American boy like Rubio doing hanging out with these characters?\u201d wrote Ana Menendez, a columnist for The Miami Herald, after the 2007 endorsement. \u201cWhat\u2019s [Huckabee\u2019s] appeal to the traditional Cuban-American voter? Until recently, Huckabee didn\u2019t think the embargo was a good idea: It hurt Arkansas\u2019 rice farmers.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Rubio said he was convinced on the basis of Huckabee\u2019s sincerity and staunch stance on abortion.\n\n\u201cI want the Republican Party to be the party of life and family, and Mike Huckabee is the best candidate on those issues,\u201d Rubio said during the endorsement on Dec. 11, 2007, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nBut one former Rubio aide explained the endorsement as a political calculation on the part of the then-Florida House speaker. At the time, Rubio was on his way out of the speakership, and he was looking to have a greater presence on the national scene. He would get more of a return with Huckabee, more so than with Fred Thompson or Rudy Giuliani or Mitt Romney or John McCain.\n\n\u201cThat was an endorsement really where they had nothing to lose, especially Marco,\u201d the aide told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt was more of an introductory move to get his foot in the door. Back then Marco was really pitching his conservative values, and it mirrored where Huckabee was\u2026 It just elevated him a little bit, elevated himself on the national scene. If Huckabee had legs, [Rubio] would have had a pretty big presence.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Rubio also saw a version of himself in Huckabee, who also grew up in poverty. Rubio praised Huckabee in January 2008 as \u201ca guy who is one generation removed from dirt floors and outdoor plumbing.\u201d\n\nThe Florida senator himself is the son of a bartender and a maid, a point he highlighted during his campaign launch in April.\n\nMike Haridopolos, who was serving in the Florida legislature in 2007 as the Senate majority whip, said Rubio also admired Huckabee\u2019s ability to relate to a crowd.\n\n\u201cWhat attracted us both was [Huckabee\u2019s] ability to communicate,\u201d said Haridopolos, who will be supporting Huckabee again in the coming election cycle. \u201cThe positive nature of Huckabee\u2019s campaign, for building people up rather than tearing people down\u2014those were the discussions Marco and I had.\u201d\n\nHuckabee eventually came in fourth during the Florida GOP primary, but not before he did a little obligatory pandering in state: at Versailles restaurant, a staple for local politics in Miami, the former governor who once opposed the Cuban embargo tied the \u201cmurder\u201d of abortion to Castro\u2019s dictatorship.\n\nLater, Huckabee would endorse Rubio for Senate in the 2010 election. But, like half of marriages, this one didn\u2019t last.\n\nThe Huckabee and Rubio campaigns declined to comment for this story.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:06.946+0000"}
{"entityId": 1601, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "It was supposed to be the declawing of America\u2019s biggest spy service. But \u201cwhat no one wants to say out loud is that this is a big win for the NSA,\u201d one former top spook says.\n\nCivil libertarians and privacy advocates were applauding yesterday after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed legislation to stop the National Security Agency from collecting Americans\u2019 phone records. But they\u2019d best not break out the bubbly.\n\nThe really big winner here is the NSA. Over at its headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, intelligence officials are high-fiving, because they know things could have turned out much worse.\n\n\u201cWhat no one wants to say out loud is that this is a big win for the NSA, and a huge nothing burger for the privacy community,\u201d said a former senior intelligence official, one of half a dozen who have spoken to The Daily Beast about the phone records program and efforts to change it.\n\nHere\u2019s the dirty little secret that many spooks are loath to utter publicly, but have been admitting in private for the past two years: The program, which was exposed in documents leaked by Edward Snowden in 2013, is more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very expensive and very cumbersome,\u201d the former official said. It requires the agency to maintain huge databases of all Americans\u2019 landline phone calls. But it doesn\u2019t contribute many leads on terrorists. It has helped prevent few\u2014if any\u2014attacks. And it\u2019s nowhere near the biggest contributor of information about terrorism that ends up on the desk of the president and other senior decision makers.\n\nIf, after the most significant public debate about balancing surveillance and liberty in a generation, this is the program that the NSA has to give up, they\u2019re getting off easy.\n\nThe bill that the House passed yesterday, called the USA Freedom Act, doesn\u2019t actually suspend the phone records program. Rather, it requires that phone companies, not the NSA, hold on to the records.\n\n\u201cGood! Let them take them. I\u2019m tired of holding on to this,\u201d a current senior U.S. official told The Daily Beast. It requires teams of lawyers and auditors to ensure that the NSA is complying with Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which authorizes the program, as well as internal regulations on how the records can and can\u2019t be used, he said. The phone records program has become a political lightning rod, the most controversial of all the classified operations that Snowden exposed. If the NSA can still get access to the records but not have to hold on to them itself, all the better, the senior official said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big win for common sense and for the country,\u201d Joel Brenner, the NSA\u2019s former inspector general, told The Daily Beast. \u201cNSA can get to do what it needs to do with a higher level of scrutiny and a little more trouble, but it can do what needs to do. At same time the government is not going to hold the bulk metadata of the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat no one wants to say out loud is that this is a big win for the NSA, and a huge nothing burger for the privacy community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NSA is coming out of this unscathed,\u201d said the former official. If the USA Freedom Act passes the Senate\u2014which is not a foregone conclusion\u2014it\u2019ll be signed by President Obama and create \u201ca more efficient and comprehensive tool\u201d for the NSA. That\u2019s because under the current regime, only the logs of landline calls are kept. But in the future, the NSA would be able to get cell phone records from the companies, too.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d the former official said. \u201cI think no one thought it was in the realm of the possible before this bill.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s another irony. Before the Snowden leaks, the NSA was already looking for alternatives to storing huge amounts of phone records in the agency\u2019s computers. And one of the ideas officials considered was asking Congress to require phone companies to hang onto that information for several years. The idea died, though, because NSA leaders thought that Congress would never agree, current and former officials have said.\n\nEnter Snowden. Suddenly the NSA found itself under orders from the White House to come up with some alternative to the phone records program that preserved it as a counterterrorism tool, but also put more checks on how the records are used. That\u2019s when General Keith Alexander, then the agency\u2019s director, dusted the old idea off the shelf and promoted it on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cThe USA Freedom Act\u201d\u2014the supposed reining in of the NSA\u2014\u201cwas literally born from Alexander,\u201d the former official said.\n\nSo the NSA effectively got what it wanted. But that doesn\u2019t mean privacy activists got nothing, or that they\u2019d count the law\u2019s passage as a loss.\n\nConsider their significant victories. Before Snowden, the NSA was secretly collecting records on hundreds of millions of Americans, a program that some members of Congress didn\u2019t even understand they were voting for when they renewed the Patriot Act, and that an appeals court ruled last week is illegal. Now the world knows what the agency exposed hundreds of millions of innocent people to potential scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThese are reforms NSA ultimately was prepared to accept; it\u2019s not as though the agency had been secretly wishing for these changes all along and was finally able to get them only now,\u201d Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told The Daily Beast. \u201cSo it seems a little odd to call it a \u2018win\u2019 for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Sanchez continued, \u201cI\u2019d certainly agree it\u2019s not a loss for NSA in any meaningful way. Indeed, there are some respects in which a shift to the carrier-centric model is likely to give them greater flexibility by allowing them to query on data the FISC order doesn\u2019t permit them to collect.\u201d For instance, billing addresses, which the NSA database doesn\u2019t have now, but that the phone companies could, in principle, provide.\n\nThe FISC is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which has been secretly authorizing the program for years. Under the new law, the NSA would have to get court approval to query the phone records. That adds another layer of oversight to the intelligence operations, but it doesn\u2019t suspend them. And there\u2019s no guarantee it would curtail them, either. The court has repeatedly found that the phone records program is legal. Presumably it\u2019s not going to stop granting NSA\u2019s requests just because the records now sit in an AT&T database instead of one owned by the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cThe NSA is coming out of this unscathed... No one thought it was in the realm of the possible.\u201d\n\nBut the NSA is not out of the woods, because surveillance critics don\u2019t see the USA Freedom Act as the last chapter. \u201cThe only downside for privacy advocates would be if the passage of this bill were invoked to claim we\u2019ve now accomplished \u2018surveillance reform\u2019 and there\u2019s no work left to be done,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nNow, advocates will turn their sights on another controversial portion of surveillance law, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. That\u2019s what lets the NSA collect email and other electronic data from big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Yahoo, including under the so-called Prism program that was the subject of the second big leak from Snowden.\n\nThat program does provide the NSA with a huge amount of information. According to intelligence officials, it\u2019s the single largest source of intelligence included in the president\u2019s daily national security briefing. And it also allows the NSA to collect large amounts of global communications as they course through equipment in the United States.\n\nTake those authorities away, and it\u2019d be like putting out one of the NSA\u2019s eyes. Section 702 is slated to sunset in 2017. If members of Congress and privacy activists mount an effort to restrict or repeal those authorities, the NSA will go to the barricades to stop them.\n\nBut that\u2019s another day. For now, the NSA is taking its lumps, and thanking its lucky stars.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:07.716+0000"}

And while the strategy is tiresome and unoriginal, it\u2019s not without its merits.\n\nWell, there\u2019s a week to go before the election, and the Democrats have zeroed in on their closing argument. Yesterday morning, my in-box was stuffed to the gunwales with alarming messages alerting me to\u2026to what?\n\nTo the fact that the Republicans don\u2019t have one decent economic idea in their collective head? To the fact that they don\u2019t want the American people to have decent health care? To the fact that, if Americans elect these people, there\u2019s zilcho chance of passing a gun law in the next decade? No, no, and no.\n\nInstead, the Democrats are reverting to Old Reliable: Social Security. When all else fails, love, sayeth the poet. Say the Democrats: When all else fails, whack them on Social Security.\n\nIt\u2019s probably in Alaska that Social Security has been the biggest issue. Republican Dan Sullivan, who leads Democratic incumbent Mark Begich in most polls, says he\u2019s against privatizing Social Security, but he has talked of raising the retirement age and means-testing benefits. Begich has courageously talked of eliminating the payroll tax cap of around $115,000. Polls typically show that Americans by fairly large majorities support Begich\u2019s fix, but that doesn\u2019t mean Alaska off-year election voters support it.\n\nMonday morning, Alison Lundergan Grimes came out swinging with an attack that Mitch McConnell opened himself up to last week. In a speech to a Rotary Club, McConnell said \u201cI spent a year trying to get any Democrat in the Senate\u201d to sign on to George W. Bush\u2019s privatization plan, but he got no takers, not even Joe Lieberman.\n\nGrimes has Elizabeth Warren coming to Louisville to campaign with her today, so one can presume that the populist Warren will bang the Social Security argument drum too, and that it will be a theme of Grimes\u2019s closing week in a race that the experts might have written off a little prematurely.\n\nIn Iowa, Democrat Bruce Braley is now up with an ad that shows extremist Republican Joni Ernst saying, \u201cYes, I have talked about privatizing Social Security.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not as if this year\u2019s Republican Party doesn\u2019t present targets of opportunity. But the Democrats always go to the old standbys.\n\nIn New Hampshire, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is on the air with an ad featuring a 65-ish (i.e. still vigorous-seeming) woman, with a syrup-thick New England accent, talking about Scott Brown\u2019s votes \u201cto cut Social Security and Medicare while protecting tax breaks for millionaires.\u201d\n\nAnd in Louisiana, the DSCC is paying for an ad in which the narrator (male voiceover this time, barely noticeable Southern lilt) warns the viewer that \u201cmillionaire\u201d Bill Cassidy, the Republican challenging Mary Landrieu, wants you to work until you\u2019re 70. Maybe that\u2019s okay for fancy-pants doctors like Cassidy, the narrator says (all right, he doesn\u2019t say fancy-pants doctor), \u201cbut we\u2019re on our feet all day, working the rigs, farming the land. Jobs you can\u2019t do at 70.\u201d\n\nIs this all going to work? Well, there\u2019s a reason the Democrats are doing it. Actually there are two reasons. The first is that they\u2019re panicked. But the second is that yes, they\u2019re doing it because it often enough does work. Old people vote in midterms, so it stands a much better chance of having an impact than a last-second student-loan scare. And it\u2019s not a stretch of the facts. McConnell did what he did in 2005, and he was foolish enough to boast about it in public less than two weeks before an election.\n\nIt\u2019s just a little hard for me to believe that a new line of attack that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the current news cycle can shift the dynamics of a campaign with just one week to go. At the very least, this line of attack should have been started last week to give it a chance to gain traction. At this point, probably the only thing that can really flip the dynamic of a particular race is a major gaffe. And who knows, maybe one of these Republicans, confronted with evidence of their privatization enthusiasm, will commit one.\n\nLook, I hope the Social Security strategy works. It may in a couple of cases, and that\u2019s all they need, a couple of unexpected wins, to keep the Senate majority. But at the same time, it\u2019s a little maddening. It\u2019s not as if this year\u2019s Republican Party doesn\u2019t present targets of opportunity. But the Democrats always go to the old standbys. In 2002, it was the prescription-drug benefit election. That was the issue that was supposed to turn the tide that year. Granted, it was just a year after 9/11, and Bush was still riding high, but Republicans gained eight seats in the House and two in the Senate.\n\nI have a larger theory about why Democrats keep doing this, but I see that I\u2019m four-fifths of the way into this column, and it\u2019s going to take me a lot more than 200 words to explain the theory, so I\u2019ll save that for tomorrow.\n\nBut for now I\u2019ll say this. It has often been observed this year that Democratic voters don\u2019t turn out in off-year elections. But why is that true? In part because they\u2019re younger and they may be more likely to think about politics in terms of personalities who come along every four years (i.e. who\u2019s running for president) than in terms of competing interests that are permanent.\n\nBut maybe in part it\u2019s because the Democrats aren\u2019t very good at giving them a reason to vote\u2014getting them to see those permanent interests. In my adult lifetime, Republicans have run three good off-year elections: 1994, with the \u201cContract for America\u201d business, which was new and galvanizing for their side; the aforementioned 2002, when Bush put personal political capital on the line and succeeded in preventing the usual incumbent-party losses; and 2010, when they fed off the tea-party rage.\n\nThe Democrats, in contrast, haven\u2019t really run one good one in my lifetime. You might say 2006, when they captured the House and Senate, but it was right after Katrina, Bush was in the toilet, and all they had to do was say \u201cIraq\u201d (in fairness, what they did well that year was to recruit good candidates).\n\nSo clearly, Republicans know something about midterms that Democrats don\u2019t. If the Democrats can\u2019t figure it out, they\u2019ll keep winning presidential elections, maybe, but keep losing majorities in off-years, and the stalemate will continue. And, by the way, eventually, the retirement age actually will go up, because someday this \u201cgrand bargain\u201d pressure will prove irresistible, and Republicans like Dan Sullivan and Joni Ernst will have leverage.\n\nSo, for now at least, go fear-mongerers.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:08.313+0000"}

Environmentalists say the Obama administration has not pushed as hard as the candidate pledged to, abetted in part by a number of red-state Democrats who see no electoral advantage in placating Greenies.\n\nAnd now some Democratic fundraisers who have combined to send tens of millions of dollars the party\u2019s way say that unless Democratic candidates for office get serious about climate change, they can expect no more money.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t give people a bye,\u201d said Marc Weiss, a New York-based Media entrepreneur who has given tens of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates in recent years and who has been organizing his fellow fundraisers not to give to any candidates who don\u2019t make addressing climate change a central campaign talking point. That has meant telling candidates he has donated to in the past that from now on, unless they change their rhetoric, they had better dial for dollars elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThis has to be one of the issues that gets debated,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople that are on the wrong side of history need to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nOther Democratic donors aren\u2019t drawing red lines but say that since they cannot give to every candidate who asks, only those who are pushing for new ways of addressing the climate crisis can count on their support\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been a political donor for very long, so it is not as if I have some history that I am now denouncing,\u201d said David desJardins, who was one of Google\u2019s earliest employees and who in the 2012 cycle alone gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic causes.

Mark Begich as a lawmaker who \u201cis not against fossil fuels but can also talk to Alaskans about how climate change is affecting their way of life.\u201d\n\nOthers whom various donors named as elected officials leading the way on climate change include Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, and Ami Bera, a California congressman who featured environmental issues in his campaign despite representing a Central Valley swing district held by a Republican until 2012.\n\n\u201cI want to see a Democratic majority in the Senate, but I just need an acknowledgement that this is a serious problem.\u201d\n\nCaroline Niemczyk, a \u201cconservation philanthropist\u201d who has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and party committees over the past couple of election cycles, pointed to Sheldon Whitehouse, a senator from Rhode Island, for convening green donors.\n\n\u201cIndividual donations tend to get a bit lost, so we are grouping together to make clear that environmental issues and climate change matter,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we pull together, we can have an impact on the Senate leadership.\u201d\n\nAnd several donors interviewed for this article said they were not giving to Democrats in tight races due to their stance on environmental issues, even though they said it was crucial that Democrats retain control of the Senate next year.\n\n\u201cI am not supporting Mary Landrieu because she has become a handmaiden for the oil and gas industry, and I just can't in good conscience back her campaign,\u201d said Susie Tompkins Buell, the founder of the Esprit clothing company and one of the more prominent Democratic donors in the country. She added that she would support Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is seeking to unseat Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in coal-rich Kentucky, \u201cbecause she would be such a huge improvement over climate denier Mitch McConnell, even though climate is not her top priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the climate, the difference between a climate-denying Republican and a Democrat who believes in the science but wants to protect the coal industry is actually quite small,\u201d added Jabe Blumenthal, a former Microsoft executive who does not give to Democrats unwilling to talk the climate talk.\n\nBut environmentally minded donors draw the line in different places.\n\n\u201cI would never give to Grimes. I would never give to Landrieu. I would never give to [West Virginia Sen. Joe] Manchin,\u201d said Wendy Abrams, a Chicago philanthropist who has given more than $120,000 to Democrats since 2012.\n\nShe singled out Colorado Sen. Mark Udall, who despite being married to Maggie Fox, president and CEO of the Climate Reality Project and a former aide to Al Gore, \u201cis afraid to take a vote on Keystone. That is insane. He knows climate change, but he is worried about his election. He should be attacking this issue.\u201d\n\nAbrams told the story of a Democratic senator who came to her and asked for a donation, saying: \u201c\u2018People don\u2019t care about global warming.\u2019 And I tell him, with all due respect, \u2018Senator, that\u2019s because you don\u2019t talk about it.\u2019 The only time I hear the words \u2018global warming\u2019 are on Fox News saying that it is not real.\u201d\n\nThe donors\u2019 banding together comes as a number of some of the nation\u2019s richest people also have made climate a priority, among them hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer\u2014who started a super PAC, NextGenClimate, which is blitzing the airwaves in key states with ads about climate change\u2014former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, and former treasury secretary Hank Paulson, who have been warning business leaders of the disruptions that climate change can cause.\n\nBut the donors say their efforts are different, as they involve not so much pouring money into issue ads but in holding candidates to account. And, they add, no matter what they do, they will never be able to match the money that the Koch brothers and other energy industry donors are able to give.\n\nEfforts at pooling resources began in the run-up to the 2012 presidential campaign. Back in 2009, the Obama administration had warned allies against talking too much about climate change as the economy was imploding. In 2011, a group of about 60 Democratic donors dissented, signing a letter to Obama calling on him to lead on climate change. That group swelled to 140 donors, and they took some measure of pride when the president called for action on climate change in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. Other groups, like Climate Heroes and Climate Hawks, helped raise money for downballot candidates who were strong on the issue.\n\nNow, though, these efforts are becoming more formalized, says Betsy Taylor, a political consultant who is leading some of the efforts to get green donors to work together. Her group has commissioned a poll showing how climate change matters to voters and is putting together a series of talking points to guide candidates on how to talk about the issue.\n\n\u201cThere is a big swath of Democratic donors that is making this a top priority,\u201d she said.\n\nAs hundreds of thousands of environmentalists prepare to descend on New York this weekend for what organizers say is a major march on climate, donors say the moment is now.\n\n\u201cI keep writing checks and I feel like the biggest idiot,\u201d said Wendy Abrams. \u201cI am doing this because I have four kids and I don\u2019t want to look back and say I gave up.

PunditFact checks the talking heads against the record.\n\nBy Lauren Carroll and Aaron Sharockman\n\nNews that a Texas hospital worker has Ebola dominated the news shows Sunday, with networks stoking fears that the virus could continue to spread in the United States.\n\nOn CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told viewers that the latest developments directly contradict the assurances of President Barack Obama and his administration.\n\n\"We were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States,\u201d McCain said.\n\nIn this case, it\u2019s McCain putting words in the mouth of Obama and top government health officials.\n\nWe searched the public comments both of Obama and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and found no such matter-of-fact assurances. What officials and Obama have repeatedly said is that while there\u2019s a chance an Ebola case could appear in the United States, the possibility of an outbreak is extremely low.\n\nFor instance, CDC official Beth Bell testified before Congress on Sept. 17, saying: \u201cWe do not view Ebola as a significant public health threat to the United States. \u2026 It is possible that infected travelers may arrive in the United States, despite all efforts to prevent this; therefore we need to ensure the United States' public health and health care systems are prepared to rapidly manage cases to avoid further transmission.\u201d\n\nA day earlier Obama said that \u201cthe chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low.\u201d\n\nAll the statements we found spoke of the unlikelihood that the disease would spread rapidly in the United States, not that it would never make it to the United States.\n\nMcCain\u2019s claim rates False.\n\nAside from Ebola, Fox News Sunday discussed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to hear appeals in a handful of states that struck down same-sex marriage bans. The decision allows same-sex marriages to proceed in those states and increases the likelihood that same-sex marriage will be allowed elsewhere.\n\nTed Olson, a prominent conservative who supports the idea of same-sex marriage, debated the developments with Tony Perkins of the conservative Family Research Council.\n\n\u201cWe know from the social science that children do best with a mom and a dad,\u201d Perkins claimed at one point. \u201cThat\u2019s why our policies have preferred marriage and given benefit to it.\u201d\n\n\"We were told there would never be a case of Ebola in the United States.\"\n\nPerkins\u2019 Family Research Council has a Web page devoted to 10 social science arguments against same-sex marriage. Of the 10, only four have to with the welfare of children.\n\nOf those four, one piece of research looked at children in single-parent households, not same-sex households, and another isn\u2019t an academic study.\n\nThe final two points from the Family Research Council address the data on children of same-sex households. You can find many research papers that claim that growing up in same-sex such households does no harm. But the council cited the court affidavit of a University of Virginia professor who said that not one of those studies \u201cwas conducted according to generally accepted standards of scientific research.\"\n\nThat testimony has been critiqued on two scores: It came in 2001 and research has passed it by, and it overlooked a range of studies. But even if the methodological critique were correct, it wouldn\u2019t prove that growing up in an opposite-sex household is better.\n\nThe council then cited the work of New York University sociologist Judith Stacey to make the point that children raised in same-sex households \u201care more likely to experience gender and sexual disorders.\u201d\n\nStacey, however, says this represents a \u201dcomplete misuse of the research\u201d and says the differences she described, such as these children being more open to same-sex relationships, need not be seen as deficits. Stacey accused the Family Research Council of cherry-picking her findings.\n\nIn contrast, we found several research projects that compared much larger numbers of children in same and opposite-sex households. One published in 2012 looked at 78 children -- about half boys and half girls -- raised by lesbian parents. The mothers joined the research project as far back as 1986, long before their children were born. The children were assessed over time and those results were matched to children from heterosexual couples.\n\nWhen asked about how they felt about themselves, their relations with their parents and with their peers, the children of lesbians responded similarly as the children of straight parents.\n\nHowever, they were more likely to report being teased at school because of their parents.\n\nThe American Psychological Association also produced a comprehensive review of studies going back three decades. The most relevant section focuses on research that compares the children of lesbian or gay parents. The studies looked at children in terms of their school performance, their relations with their peers, intelligence, self-esteem and a number of other variables.\n\nAccording to this review, \u201cthe belief that children of lesbian and gay parents suffer deficits in personal development has no empirical foundation.\u201d\n\nPerkins\u2019 claim that social science shows \u201cthat children do best with a mom and a dad\u201d rates False.\n\nJon Greenberg and Nai Issa contributed to this report.

But unlike 2008 and 2012, both presidential years, it is the Democrats who are struggling under this burden, with red and purple states emerging as the key battlegrounds. Just ask Edwin Edwards, Louisiana\u2019s former four-term Democratic governor, convicted felon, and extortionist, who at the age of 87 is running for Congress. He\u2019ll tell you.\n\nEdwards crudely framed the state of play in the South as a matter of race, sexual orientation, and class; in other words, culture. Said Edwards, according to the Financial Times, \u201cSome people view the Democratic Party as strictly for gays and blacks and non-productive people,\u201d not exactly the thing that the party faithful want to be reading as Election Day nears.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 challenge of retaining the Senate is compounded by a midterm electorate that is generally more rural, white, married, and churchgoing than in presidential years. For example, in 2012 less than three-quarters of voters were white. In contrast, in the 2010 midterms, that figure was 77 percent, five points higher. As Woody Allen said, 80 percent of life is about showing up.\n\nA recent Pew Poll graphically likewise portrays the stark national divide, and the granular differences are gaping. Republicans hold an 18-point lead among non-Latino whites, while Democrats are ahead by 62 percent among minorities. Pew also gives the GOP a whopping 68 points lead among white evangelicals, but shows Republicans lagging by more than 30 percent among the religiously non-affiliated.\n\nAccording to a Washington Post/ABC Poll taken earlier this month, the Democrats held a meager 1-point lead on the generic ballot among women.\n\nFurther complicating things for the Democrats is that the upcoming elections coincide with the sixth year of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, which is seldom an auspicious time for the \u201cin\u201d party, and definitely not one for Obama\u2014whose favorability ratings are underwater, and who wears his disdain for the realities of governing and politics on his sleeve and on his face. To put things in perspective, under Bill Clinton the Democrats actually picked up House seats in the 1998 midterm elections, and didn\u2019t lose any Senate seats\u2014a first since the Civil War. However, Barack isn\u2019t Bill, and America has since changed.\n\nStill, in all fairness, Clinton was aided by a voter backlash against the Republicans impeachment crusade against the popular president. Heading into next week\u2019s elections, impeachment isn\u2019t on the table, and Obama evokes little sympathy.\n\nAs for Edwards, his comments on Southern politics have not drawn fire from leading Democrats\u2014but one could safely have bet they would have pilloried Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, if he had said anything remotely close. Yet, you can\u2019t really blame Obama & Co. for their silence. In a crowded field, Edwards has a shot of recapturing the House seat being vacated by Sen. Mary Landrieu\u2019s (D-La.) Republican challenger, Bill Cassidy.\n\nNot surprisingly, this is not the first time Edwards has shared his vivid take on life. In 1983, he quipped that the only way he could lose an election was if he were \u201ccaught in bed with a dead girl or a live boy.\u201d True to his word, in 1984 Edwards won election to a third term.\n\nBut it\u2019s just about demographics being on the Republicans\u2019 side for the moment. Sanity matters, too. This election is also about the Republicans not committing unforced errors, errors that signal a rejection of reality, and hostility toward women. This cycle no Republican has come close to drawing gradations about rape, and the absence of those confessions of true belief has been a boon to the GOP.\n\nIndeed, the distaff vote may yet again break Republican this cycle\u2014as it did in 2010\u2014if the polls are to be believed. Last week, The Wall Street Journal blared, \u201cIn Iowa, Arkansas and Colorado, Democrats\u2019 Advantage Among Women Voters Has Diminished.\u201d Democrats should be concerned.\n\nAccording to a Washington Post/ABC Poll taken earlier this month, the Democrats held a meager 1-point lead on the generic ballot among women. A more recent Associated Press-GfK poll reflected similar numbers. In the latest AP Poll: \u201cthe two parties are about even among women, 44 percent prefer the Republicans, 42 percent the Democrats,\u201d which marks a noticeable drop for the Democrats. Back in September, 47 percent of female likely voters had favored a Democratic-controlled Congress, while only two-in-five wanted the Republicans to rule the congressional roost, according to AP-GfK.\n\nTo be sure, Republican rule of the Senate is not a foregone conclusion. Real Clear Politics gives the GOP only 46 seats out of 51 needed, and labels 9 states as toss-ups. Nate Silver fixes the odds of a GOP pick-up at just 60 percent and depicts a static portrait of the Republicans\u2019 chances, with the numbers barely budging since Labor Day. In Georgia, Democrat Michelle Nunn may paint a red seat blue, while in Kansas, Pat Roberts, a three-term Republican incumbent, may be going down to defeat at the hands of Independent Greg Orman.\n\nStill, based upon the wide-angle snapshot of what and where control of the Senate hinges, it\u2019s the Republicans who hold an advantage. Where it counts this time\u2014in purple and red America\u2014who the Democrats are and what the party stands for is more burden than benefit, just as who the Republicans are and what they\u2019re about is a headache for the GOP in presidential years.\n\nOnce again, this election is about the Great American divide; only more so. Louisiana\u2019s Edwards may be loutish, but he\u2019s not crazy.

{"entityId": 1607, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "They insist we don\u2019t need another committee to investigate the attack\u2014but they\u2019re really afraid of the incompetence the truth will reveal.\n\nI read with interest my Daily Beast colleague Michael Tomasky\u2019s column Wednesday, in which he asserted that the establishment of a Special Select Committee to investigate Benghazi is nothing more than bulls**t. Putting aside that disrespectful characterization of a search for truth and accountability for an attack in which four Americans lost their lives, I\u2019m troubled by the motivation of many on the left, who have sought to demonize anyone who questions the narrative the Obama administration has spun for nearly two years.\n\nI concur with our colleague Kirsten Powers, who writes that the glib, evasive, and arrogant posture of the White House and the president\u2019s supporters has brought about the present Benghazi inquiry. The American people were told repeatedly in the days and weeks following the attack that it was the result of an offensive video\u201a an assessment the president and secretary of state surely knew within hours was far from the truth.\n\nRather than level with the American people and admit what senior administration officials knew\u2014as well as taking steps to protect our diplomatic assets abroad\u2014the Obama administration stuck with the line that GM was alive, Osama bin Laden was dead, and al Qaeda was on the run. It was hard to square that circle when the Libyan prime minister and our deputy chief of mission in Libya immediately asserted that Benghazi was a preplanned terrorist attack.\n\nReturning to Tomasky\u2019s piece, I was incredulous at his view of the Benghazi attacks and the prism through which he sees the world. First he tells us:\n\n\u201cBenghazi is and has been for some time a witch hunt that perverts all notions of democratic accountability and that obviously carries one purpose and one purpose only\u2014the humiliation or worse of as many Democrats as possible, preferably the big cheeses (Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton).\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with the notion that this is a witch hunt with the sole purpose of humiliating as many Democrats as possible.\n\nAmbassador Chris Stevens was a political appointee of President Obama and worked under the immediate supervision of Secretary State Hillary Clinton. Democrats, both. Neither Obama nor Clinton have explained why their political appointee\u2019s requests to get security in Benghazi increased were denied. The American people deserve to know the truth. That is hardly a partisan question, but it could expose incompetence once the real answers are uncovered.\n\nNext Tomasky tells us that the Benghazi attack has been probed with two Senate reports and eight House reports. Case closed, right? What he doesn\u2019t tell us is that Secretary of State Clinton has not been interviewed directly under oath. He mentions the investigation chaired by Admiral Mike Mullen and Thomas Pickering but fails to note that the secretary did not make herself available for questioning. Surely one cannot have a comprehensive review of the actions and activities undertaken by the State Department when the secretary is not part of the review process. For that matter, isn\u2019t it odd that none of the personnel from the diplomatic compound in Benghazi have been interviewed on the record? What was their experience that evening, and did they witness a protest sparked by a video? A Select Committee on Benghazi will certainly provide these answers.\n\nTomasky tells us that Susan Rice, then U.N. ambassador to the United Nations, merely told the American people what the CIA told her to say about Benghazi. I\u2019m sorry to say that\u2019s not true. The truth, sadly, is that the Obama White House misled the American people when it redacted a lawfully subpoenaed document that was disclosed only after a lawsuit by Judicial Watch. In that document, White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes pushed the notion that the attack was triggered by a spontaneous demonstration, not a breakdown in policy. The first three goals in the document, which was withheld from Congress, were:\n\n\u201cTo convey that the United States is doing everything we can to protect our people and our facilities abroad;\n\n\u201cTo underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy;\n\n\u201cTo show we will be resolute in bringing people who harm Americans to justice, and standing steadfast during these protests.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Tomasky can tell us how the United States has done everything to protect our people and our facilities abroad when our own State Department denied the ambassador\u2019s requests for additional security. Perhaps he can show us how the protests were rooted in an Internet video, a claim our intelligence services and military officials immediately knew to be false. Or perhaps he can explain how the Obama administration has brought \u201cpeople who harm Americans to justice\u201d when The New York Times was able to interview a terrorist ringleader about the attack as he sipped a strawberry frappe barely a month after the attack. The grand total of those apprehended or held responsible to date has been zero.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s BS: The Obama administration has misled, dissembled, and otherwise given the finger to the families of those who lost their lives that night.\n\nFinally, despite all the congressional Democrats\u2019 snickering and posturing this week, a Select Committee on Benghazi can answer one question that remains unanswered: Where was the president of the United States the evening of September 11, 2012, and what steps did he take that evening?\n\nWe know from former National Security Council spokesman Tommy \u201cDude, That Was Two Years Ago\u201d Vietor that the president was in the Executive Mansion but not in the Situation Room on the evening in question. Did he monitor the events unfolding overseas? Was he briefed throughout the evening? Why didn\u2019t he order a military rescue mission? Only after the attack occurred did we find out it spanned nearly eight hours. Surely military assets could have been sent to Libya from Italy or elsewhere. Did the commander in chief ask military assets to stand down?\n\nI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s BS, Mr. Tomasky: The Obama administration has misled, dissembled, and otherwise given the finger to the families of those who lost their lives that night in service to their country. I\u2019m willing to believe that the personnel on the ground in Benghazi were terrified, confused, and hoping the cavalry was on its way to save them from terrorists seeking to kill them. We need a Special Select Committee on Benghazi to ascertain these facts and ensure that such a disaster never occurs again. We need truth, not bullsh*t, from the president and his administration, but so far, that\u2019s all they\u2019ve been shoveling.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:10.705+0000"}
{"entityId": 1608, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "As Julian Castro takes over at HUD, one gets the feeling there\u2019s more going on here than just another guy filling another Cabinet job.\n\nI\u2019m convinced that, when planning their next move, all great American political families get together in late-night strategy sessions at the kitchen table. Over endless cups of coffee, they make lists of pluses and minuses, identify the obstacles and opportunities, and try to contemplate every possible scenario. Nothing is left to chance.\n\nAnd something tells me that a certain Mexican-American family in San Antonio is no different.\n\nThe Irish have the Kennedys of Massachusetts. The Italians have the Cuomos of New York. And the Mexicans, who represent as much as two-thirds of the 52 million Latinos in the United States, now have the Castros of Texas: Joaquin and Julian.\n\nThe 39-year-old twins, for whom degrees from Stanford University and Harvard Law School were just a launching pad, are taking the Democratic Party by storm. Joaquin is a first-term congressman, representing San Antonio. And Julian, well, you could say that he\u2019s applying for a new job.\n\nToday, in a ceremony in the Rose Garden, President Obama nominated Julian Castro to join the Cabinet as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nI\u2019ve known both brothers for 12 years, and I consider them friends. Here\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t know about them. Their two greatest assets aren\u2019t political connections or fancy degrees. It\u2019s their humility and levelheadedness.\n\nI once asked Joaquin where the humility came from, telling him that I routinely run across Latino politicians who have accomplished a lot less but have much more swagger. He told me it came from the fact that they grew up poor\u2014not in Hyannis Port, but in a hardscrabble city in South Texas where folks scratch out an existence.\n\n\u201cWe grew up on the west side of San Antonio,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a place of humble, hard-working people who basically grind out a living. That\u2019s always stuck with us. Now, we never saw ourselves as poor. But we also never saw ourselves as anything special.\u201d\n\nThe levelheadedness is reflected in the fact that, while New York and Washington journalists are churning out copy suggesting that Texas is turning purple, the brothers haven\u2019t let that kind of talk turn their heads. When they look around their home state, the only color they see is red. The Castros are realists who understand what a lot of outsiders don\u2019t: The political careers of most Texas Democrats have expiration dates. Unless they leave Texas.\n\nAs a friend, I want the best for Julian. And yet, I\u2019m still not completely sold that heading the federal housing department is it.\n\nCastro hasn\u2019t even been confirmed yet, and already, I gather, some people expect him to be of symbolic use to the White House. Recently, a national reporter asked me if I thought the Castro nomination would help the administration smooth things over with Latinos.\n\nBefore I get to the answer, it\u2019s true that the relationship needs fixing. According to polls, the nation\u2019s largest minority\u2014while still supportive of Obama by a slim margin\u2014is furious that this administration has so aggressively deported a record number of illegal immigrants, most of them Latino.\n\n\n\nAccording to a recent survey by the Pew Hispanic Center, Obama\u2019s approval rating among Latinos has dropped nearly 20 points since the 2012 election, from 73 percent to 54 percent.\n\nTwo million deportations in five years may have solidified Obama\u2019s reputation as a tough guy on illegal immigration and soothed the anxiety of blue-collar workers who feel that illegal immigrants threaten jobs and put downward pressure on wages. But removing all those people has also resulted in thousands of divided families, thousands of children dumped into foster care, thousands of unaccompanied minors shipped to Mexico, and more.\n\nThis undeclared war on the Latino immigrant family was bound to haunt Obama. For Latinos, there is no more sacred institution than the family. You mess with it at your peril. Yet, at the same time, Latinos, and Mexican-Americans in particular, are also notably proud when one of their own accomplishes great things. My 72-year-old father, having grown up in California in the 1940s when Mexican-Americans were treated as second-class citizens, still lights up whenever he spots a brown face in a high place. \u201cLook,\u201d he\u2019ll say, \u201ca Latino!\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the moment, the person going places is Julian Castro. The 39-year-old political rock star is on a roll. His achievements include being called to the White House to discuss policy issues like immigration and delivering the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic Convention.\n\nMany Latinos are understandably proud of Castro, and they want to see him succeed.\n\nAbout four years ago, I was at breakfast in Los Angeles with the brothers.. Two older women approached our table, and introduced themselves. After visiting for a few minutes, as the women turned to leave, one of them told the twins: \u201cQue Dios los bendiga.\u201d (May God bless you). Then they all hugged. Not your typical public reaction to politicians.\n\nJoining the Cabinet could set Castro up for bigger things, like being considered for the vice presidential spot on the 2016 Democratic ticket, or possibly a return to Texas to run for governor or U.S. Senate.\n\nYet, if the upside is evident, so is the downside. Castro could be good for Washington, but Washington isn't likely to be good for Castro. Trying to manage a federal bureaucracy can lower your profile, and the nation\u2019s capital can be a treacherous place\u2014especially for those who are thought to have bright futures. You have to command an army of lifers who have seen lead administrators come and go, and aren\u2019t known for falling in line.\n\nBesides, it\u2019s easy to speculate that an elected official can take a sabbatical from Texas and spend a few years in Washington and then return home to run for statewide office. But pulling it off could prove more difficult. I lived in Dallas for five years, and the elected officials who have the smoothest road in the Lone Star State aren\u2019t identified with Washington but, like Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Ted Cruz, are known for battling it.\n\nIt would be tricky for Castro to craft that kind of outsider reputation as housing secretary, especially being identified with an administration that is so unpopular in Texas. He might be better off staying in San Antonio, running for reelection next year and then putting together\u2014with the help of a national fundraising network that he might already have started to build\u2014a campaign for governor in 2018.\n\nNow, for the reporter\u2019s question. Will putting Castro in the Cabinet be enough to placate those Latinos disillusioned with Obama?\n\nNo. To be honest, it probably won\u2019t be. The student activists staging hunger strikes outside the White House, or being arrested outside the front gate, are so focused on the immigration issue that they probably couldn\u2019t care less who is U.S. Housing Secretary. The only Cabinet position they care about is Secretary of Homeland Security, and only because that person has a say over whether the undocumented can legally remain in the United States.\n\n\n\nFor the immigration activists who are turning the screws on Obama, what matters isn\u2019t personnel but policy. And the only thing that will soothe their rage is something that won\u2019t happen: a complete end to all deportations.\n\nThese activists aren\u2019t likely to think any better of Obama just because he invited Castro into his administration. A more realistic scenario is that, as time goes on, they\u2019ll come to think less of Castro for accepting the invitation.\n\nYou can bet that much of this made its way into the brothers\u2019 calculus when they were in that kitchen in San Antonio, trying to decide whether it was in Julian\u2019s best interest to say \u201cyes\u201d to the Cabinet job. They probably even made a list of pro\u2019s and con\u2019s.\n\nThe biggest pro: Texas is a dead-end for Democrats. The dependable red state is going to stay in Republican hands for a long time, and so\u2014if he wants to climb the ladder\u2014Julian has to find a way to circumvent the Lone Star State. This could be the way to do that.\n\nThe biggest con: Washington is a merciless meat-grinder of a place that ends as many political careers as it launches. The hyper-partisan tone, and the fact that bright young stars like Castro often come into town with targets on their chest, is enough to make his supporters worry that he\u2019s made a mistake.\n\n\n\nAmbition makes people do dumb things. Before long, we\u2019ll know whether this is one of those times.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:11.163+0000"}
{"entityId": 1609, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "From the gay Republican battling the Iraq War veteran Democrat in Massachusetts to the scandal-tarred Florida candidates and a possible blue pickup in deep-red Nebraska, what to watch.\n\nSome of the most interesting and important elections of 2014 are happening in the House of Representatives. While overall control of the House is not in doubt\u2014even the most partisan Democrats concede that not only will John Boehner remain speaker but that the GOP will likely pick up seats\u2014there are an array of peculiar and competitive elections this year that combine to shed interesting light on this odd election season. Even though 32 races aren\u2019t even contested and only 64 out of 435 seats are considered even slightly competitive, there\u2019s still plenty of action. Here are eight of the most interesting House races of 2014.\n\nMassachusetts\u2019s 6th District\n\nSeth Moulton (D) v. Richard Tisei (R)\n\nIs 2014 such a bad year for Democrats that a Republican could win in Massachusetts? Richard Tisei is an openly gay Republican former state legislator making his second bid for Congress on the Bay State\u2019s North Shore. Tisei\u2019s chances took a big hit this year when incumbent Democrat John Tierney lost his primary to Seth Moulton, a relatively unknown Iraq War veteran. Tierney had been embroiled in scandal when his wife pleaded guilty to tax fraud in connection to an online gambling ring run by her two brothers. As a result, Tisei almost beat Tierney in the Democratic year of 2012 and was primed to win a rematch. Now, with Moulton on the ballot, Tisei still has a chance in the most Republican-leaning district in Massachusetts, but it\u2019s an uphill battle on turf that President Obama won by 11 points in 2012.\n\nNebraska\u2019s 2nd District\n\nBrad Ashford (D) v. Incumbent Lee Terry (R)\n\nIn deep-red Nebraska, by contrast, even with Obama\u2019s massive unpopularity Democrats could pick up a congressional seat. Incumbent Lee Terry has never been terribly popular in his district, which includes all of Omaha and much of the city\u2019s suburbs. But Terry has really been in trouble this year after he insisted he wouldn\u2019t give up his paycheck during the 2013 government shutdown because \u201cDang straight\u2026I\u2019ve got a nice house and a kid in college.\u201d The resulting furor has kept Terry on the defensive against Democrat Brad Ashford and forced groups supporting the Republican incumbent to air \u201cWillie Horton-style\u201d negative ads on his behalf. Strategists from both parties suggest this race could go either way.\n\nFlorida\u2019s 26th District\n\nIncumbent Joe Garcia (D) v. Carlos Curbelo (R)\n\nFlorida is famously weird, but the rest of the state looks normal compared to the bizarre politics in South Florida\u2019s 26th District. First term Democratic incumbent Joe Garcia won election in 2012 by beating Republican David Rivera, currently an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal fraud investigation. But Garcia has been tied to scandal himself. His former chief of staff has pleaded guilty to voter fraud. And, even worse in some people\u2019s eyes, Garcia has been accused of eating his own earwax on live television. Garcia\u2019s opponent, Carlos Curbelo, is a rising Republican star who has been caught up in several scandals of his own stemming from his career as an unregistered lobbyist. The election is expected to be a tossup in this heavily Cuban American South Florida district. However, the uproar over Curbelo\u2019s description of Social Security and Medicare as \u201cPonzi schemes\u201d may be just enough to keep the Republican from winning in November.\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s 3rd District\n\nIncumbent Nick Rahall (D) v. Evan Jenkins (R)\n\nDemocrat Nick Rahall is one of the longest-serving members of Congress in Washington. First elected in his coal-mining southern West Virginia district in 1976, he has accumulated more seniority than all but six other members of Congress, three of whom are retiring this year. But while Rahall\u2019s district was a Democratic bastion when he won his first race, it is now fervently Republican, and Mitt Romney won almost two-thirds of the votes there in 2012. This year\u2019s race has turned into one of the ugliest, nastiest and most expensive campaigns of the cycle, as Republican state Sen. Evan Jenkins, who switched parties to run for the seat, dukes it out with the longtime incumbent. The race represents perhaps the last stand for Democrats in Appalachia, as social and environmental issues trigger a massive political realignment in the region.\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s 2nd District\n\nNick Casey (D) v. Alex Mooney (R)\n\nEven with Rahall on the ropes, Democrats still have some hope in the Mountain State. With longtime Republican incumbent Shelley Moore Capito running for Senate, the GOP nominated a very conservative former state senator named Alex Mooney. While Mooney is slightly more conservative than the median voter in his solidly Republican district, that doesn\u2019t hurt him too much. What does is the fact that the state Senate district he represented until 2010 is across the Potomac River in Maryland. The result is that Mooney, who also ran for the New Hampshire state Legislature while a Dartmouth undergrad, has been attacked as a carpetbagger. His opponent, Nick Casey, is a longtime Democratic Party stalwart who has run a strong campaign and seems to have the momentum in the race. The question is whether that will be enough for a non-incumbent in a Republican year in a state where Obama is about as popular as getting a root canal.\n\nNew York\u2019s 11th District\n\nDomenic Recchia (D) v. Incumbent Michael Grimm (R)\n\nIn this Staten Island-based district, which Obama won in 2012, Democrat Domenic Recchia has a significant fundraising advantage and Republican incumbent Michael Grimm is facing a 20-count indictment, so why is the race still close? Although the National Republican Congressional Committee cut Grimm off after his indictment, the two-term incumbent\u2014best known for threatening a reporter with violence on camera\u2014has remained popular in his district. Part of that is geography: Grimm is from Staten Island, which makes up a significant majority of the district, while Recchia is from Brooklyn, and his candidacy has aroused parochial feelings west of the Verrazano Bridge. Recchia is also not a great candidate. The Democrat attracted national attention when he was mocked on The Daily Show for touting his foreign policy expertise, which consisted of running an exchange program with students from Japan. It\u2019s still hard to imagine Grimm will win reelection, but Recchia is doing all he can to give hope to the embattled Republican.\n\nColorado\u2019s 6th District\n\nAndrew Romanoff (D) v. Incumbent Mike Coffman (R)\n\nThis suburban Denver district was ground zero for the new Democratic coalition built by Obama. Once staunchly Republican territory represented by conservative Tom Tancredo, the district was won twice by Obama, and Democrats had recruited a top-tier candidate to run in former House speaker Andrew Romanoff. But it looks like three-term incumbent Mike Coffman will hold off Romanoff, as much because of statewide and national factors as the lean of the district. Democrats are struggling up and down the ticket in the Rocky Mountain State. Both incumbent Gov. John Hickenlooper and Sen. Mark Udall are struggling against Republican opponents in races where they were favored only a few months ago. With national Democrats focused on defending vulnerable incumbents, Romanoff has an uphill fight.\n\nArizona\u2019s 2nd District\n\nIncumbent Ron Barber (D) v. Martha McSally (R)\n\nIn the Tucson-based seat formerly held by Gabby Giffords, Democratic incumbent Ron Barber is facing a rematch against Republican Martha McSally. In 2012, the race was so close that it wasn\u2019t called for Barber until nearly two weeks after Election Day. Both candidates have strong biographies. Barber, Giffords\u2019s former district director, was wounded in the 2011 attempt on her life in a supermarket parking lot that killed six. McSally, an Air Force veteran, was the first American woman to fly in combat. Strategists from both parties expect the race to come down to a few hundred votes in either direction in a swing seat that both John McCain and Mitt Romney barely won.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:11.314+0000"}

The political pivot comes when they realize that there could be a world without Hunger Games at all. The rules of this game are man-made. They benefit some people and hurt many others\u2014even the so-called winners, who survive by becoming killers, then become the celebrity playthings of Capitol elites. With this insight, the fight against the other contestants and the other districts can become a united rebellion against the Capitol.\n\nNo one needs to be racist for the system to keep spitting out racist results. No one needs to hate for a game to be hateful.\n\nAnd what about here in our real world, the one Suzanne Collins didn\u2019t create? Well, of course the Hunger Games is a violent fairy tale. There\u2019s no leering President Snow behind our rules of the game. But the enormous resonance of the story suggests it\u2019s caught something many Americans sense: these rules are not the best we can do. We are living with our own Hunger Games.\n\nWhat are our Hunger Games? I\u2019d start with the economy. The fact that tens of millions of Americans still can\u2019t afford health care\u2014especially but not only in states that have resisted Obamacare\u2014means that losing the game can literally mean dying. Statistically, rejecting the Medicaid expansion means more than a thousand early deaths every year in my state, North Carolina, mostly among the working poor. That\u2019s just one rule of the game.\n\nAnother is that, because it\u2019s hard to unionize, a worker who asks for more is likely to be replaced by someone who will ask for less. Solidarity is harder, and people are pitted against one another. The 29 coal miners who were killed in the Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia four years ago were non-unionized, which made it easier for their bosses to ignore safety rules and press for ramped-up production over human life. Don Blankenship, then-head of the company, has just been criminally indicted, but it\u2019s five years too late. His policies made the workplace a Hunger Games arena of its own. National labor law made it easier for him to do.\n\nIn this week of Ferguson and everything it stands for, looking behind the rules of the game is especially urgent. The American economy does not teach us that \u201cblack lives matter,\u201d at least not as much as white lives. At the start of each Hunger Games, the contestants scramble for a pile of survival gear and weapons before taking off for the woods to hunt one another. Here, black children are born into families with about 10 percent\u2014one-tenth\u2014the average wealth of white families. They are born in neighborhoods with fewer business owners, fewer professionals\u2014fewer of the patrons who can spot their talent and send the real-world version of those little silver parachutes that drop into the Hunger Games arena to save our heroes.\n\nSome white people and immigrants feel personally accused by talk of a \u201cracist\u201d system. After all, don\u2019t they work hard and play by the rules? Do they hate anybody? This perspective can be perfectly sincere and deeply personally decent. (On the Midwestern side of the family, I come from people who work very hard, obey all the rules, and hate no one\u2014who, in fact, would help anyone who needed it.)\n\nBut once we understand that it\u2019s the rules of the game that are the problem, we can see that no one needs to be racist for the system to keep spitting out racist results. No one needs to hate for a game to be hateful. Even \u201cfair\u201d rules, which treat every person alike, are not really fair if the contestants scramble across the starting line in very unequal situations, some with swords and bows, some with a little rope and a box of matches. The problem is that being a decent person in an indecent situation is not enough, even though it may also be all you can do.\n\nThis is especially hard to see because Americans, even more than other people, tend to see the rules of the market as natural and unchangeable facts. Gravity, as the tee-shirt says, isn\u2019t just a good idea; it\u2019s the law. In American life, the familiar version of market competition is often treated as that kind of law, the kind you can\u2019t change and defy only if you don\u2019t mind falling on your face.\n\nThis is naivet\u00e9, but it isn\u2019t exactly innocent anymore. We have no excuse for ignorance about the universal health care that most wealthy countries enjoy, the more cooperative and secure German labor economy (where union representatives are entitled to a generous share of seats on corporate boards), or the Swedish family-leave policies that mean you don\u2019t risk losing your job if you dedicate six months to your new baby. And we have no excuse for not knowing that our economy, our schools, and our policing enforce an inequality that many of us wouldn\u2019t wish for but few are doing much to change.\n\nAs grown-ups without turbo-charged explosive arrows, we can only change the rules through politics. And our politics reinforces our Hunger Games economy, thanks partly to the Supreme Court\u2019s commitment to treating money as speech and, therefore, democracy as a branch of capitalism. No wonder we enjoy a story where all the power is concentrated in a few wealthy hands. It\u2019s not quite our reality, but it\u2019s not exactly unfamiliar, either.\n\nOn a holiday dedicated to reflection, we should take seriously the political impulse that the Hunger Games spurs, even if the movie itself has no politics beyond that impulse. We love winners, even against our better judgment, which is why, in the first movie, we were unsettlingly like the Capitol\u2019s fans, thrilling to the macabre bloodshed in the arena. But we also know better. Solidarity, looking out for one another, can move us more. And, just like Katniss, we need rules that make solidarity a centerpiece of shared life, not a desperate act of rebellion. Recognizing this is the first step away from a Hunger Games economy. It is a grown-up\u2019s way to be the Mockingjay.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:11.935+0000"}

It\u2019s the fault of her party and its culture\u2014and the GOP will pay for it with women.\n\nJust a wild guess, but I have a hunch that Kirsten Kukowski is glad Tuesday is over. Kukowski is a press aide at the Republican National Committee. I do believe I\u2019ve spoken with her on an occasion or two, something to do with credentials. She seemed nice enough.\n\nAnd so I almost felt a little sorry for her Tuesday as I watched her performance on Jansing & Co. on MSNBC, hurtling herself into enemy territory, burdened with the task of defending her party\u2019s record and posture on women. Kirsten, I\u2019ve been there. All of us who\u2019ve done television have\u2014those moments when you know you\u2019ve got nothing, so you keep talking and talking, saying nothing, larding your sentences down with \u201cyou know\u201ds and \u201cuh\u201ds, wondering if the viewers can see your face turning red, praying that any second now you\u2019ll hear the host say, \u201cSorry, we\u2019re out of time.\u201d\n\nOK, I don\u2019t feel sorry for her. She made her bed, as they say. Besides which, knowing she was appearing on the liberal cable channel and would surely be asked the obvious question of what the Republican Party\u2019s women-centric policy ideas consisted of, she damn well should have had a better answer than that we should study \u201ccorporate best stand...best practices. How are, are some of these large companies going about, um, you know, paying men, paying women? And, and let\u2019s have this conversation and be transparent about the need, um, to close this gender gap, but I think it\u2019s the way the Democrats are going about it and it\u2019s just in a dishonest fashion.\u201d\n\nOK, on reflection, I do feel a little sorry for her. That she had only gibberish to spout in response to that question isn\u2019t really her fault. It\u2019s the fault of her party, all those men in her party, all those Southern men and their Southern beliefs and ways. One is tempted to believe that Republicans vote against things like the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act because of the demands of their corporate contributors, and that\u2019s undoubtedly true, to some extent. But it isn\u2019t corporate benefactors who make Todd Akin and some of these other men say the batshit crazy things about women they say. That\u2019s culture.\n\nIt\u2019s partly a corporate thing, a business thing. But mostly it\u2019s cultural. Women just aren\u2019t supposed to be that pushy.\n\nI have a little story, something that happened in my life that just blew my mind. I\u2019ve told this before, so to my longer-suffering readers, please indulge me.\n\nThis was, oh, 1990. Down South. A wedding. At the morning-after breakfast on Sunday, the groom\u2019s father got up and gave a little speech and suggested that everyone introduce themselves. So he said my name is such-and-such, and then\u2014tapping his wife solicitously on the shoulder\u2014introduced his wife and spoke for her as she beamed up at him. And so it went, around the Dixie half of the room, men standing and speaking, solicitously tapping, wives remaining seated and silently beaming.\n\nThose of us in the Yankee half of the room stared at each other in disbelief. Are they putting us on? This is how these people live? In short order, as I counted noses, it became clear that the first Northern couple who would seize the floor would be my parents. Mom before Dad. I studied them to see if they were whispering to each other, to talk about what to do. They did not.\n\nBut sure enough, when the crucial moment came, Mom shot right up and introduced herself, saying what she did. Dad followed her. And every Yankee couple followed their lead. It was just as emphatic a display of our warring outlooks and values systems as I\u2019d ever been exposed to. And I still think of that day on weeks like this, when Republicans trot out to cable television to talk about women, because it still explains a lot, I think.\n\nKukowski had nothing to say because George W. Bush sat in the White House for eight years, six of them with a compliant Republican Congress, and never passed or that I can recall even introduced or even talked about one bill aimed at workplace gender fairness. She had nothing to say because since Barack Obama became president, the Republicans have voted no no no on any measure of this sort. Four Senate Republicans did vote aye on Lilly Ledbetter back in 2009. Yep, you guessed it: the \u201cgirls\u201d\u2014Collins, Hutchison, Murkowski, Snowe. Not a single man. In the House, Ledbetter got three.\n\nIt\u2019s partly a corporate thing, a business thing. But mostly it\u2019s cultural. Women just aren\u2019t supposed to be that pushy. \u201cAll Republicans support equal pay for equal work,\u201d claimed the first sentence of the memo Kukowski and two colleagues released Tuesday. Of course, they have to say that. But obviously, all Republicans do not, or they\u2019d have done something, on their terms, during those six years Bush and Denny Hastert and Bill Frist were running things. Very few Republicans do. Especially the Southern ones, who by and large run the party, or at least provide its cultural ballast. It isn\u2019t how they were raised, and it doesn\u2019t feel right to them. They think the Paycheck Fairness Act has its origins in that night when a likkered-up Mickey Gilley slashed Johnny Paycheck\u2019s tires.\n\nLook at these interesting Gallup numbers, which show the gender gap in presidential elections going back to 1952. Eisenhower walloped Stevenson among women. Nixon beat Kennedy! George H.W. Bush beat Mike Dukakis by four points among women, Gallup says. But since 1992, the Democrats haven\u2019t lost among women. I should note that Republicans win among white women, but their share of the pie is shrinking, and Obama won massively among women of color. So the GOP\u2019s \u201cwomen problem\u201d is also to some extent a minority problem; that population is growing, and Republicans sure don\u2019t appear to be fixing that anytime soon.\n\nIndeed, as we move forward, as we have more single mothers, fewer stay-at-home wives, more women who speak for themselves at cross-cultural gatherings, eventually, the GOP is going to lose that edge among white women, too. Eventually? If Hillary Clinton is the Democratic candidate next time, the Republican Party will lose it then. And if the Republican gets, oh, 46 percent of the white women\u2019s vote, we\u2019ll be looking at a huge blowout. But remember: All Republicans support equal pay for equal work!", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:12.214+0000"}
{"entityId": 1612, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Eric Cantor lost because hard-core voters think his kind keep selling out to Obama. The idea is insane as they are.\n\nAmong the 3,672 reasons you\u2019ve read and heard for David Brat\u2019s victory over Eric Cantor, here\u2019s one you haven\u2019t seen. This explanation doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Cantor palling around with lobbyists, or with Laura Ingraham\u2019s one-liners. It\u2019s about ideology, and it\u2019s pretty straightforward: Self-identified conservatives in 2014 are really conservative, and they increasingly think that Republicans in Congress\u2014Republicans in Congress, mind you\u2014are a bunch of namby-pambies.\n\nYou want numbers? I got numbers. Last month, the centrist Democratic group Third Way released a study called \u201cThe State of the Center.\u201d The report is not just another poll. It\u2019s a really comprehensive and unique piece of work that yields more illuminating results than any poll. It has many elements, but here\u2019s the part of interest to us. The group asked 1,500 Americans to identify themselves on an ideological scale of 1 to 9, 1 being the most liberal and 9 being the most conservative. Then these respondents were asked where they would place Democrats in Congress, Republicans in Congress, Barack Obama, and their ideal president. The answers are fascinating and jaw-dropping in that way that these kinds of findings about conservatives are, alas, no longer jaw-dropping.\n\nLet\u2019s start on the left side of the spectrum. Liberals put themselves at 3.88 on the ideology scale\u2014that is, considerably closer to the middle (5) than to the far left (1). They put Obama at 4.23, just a little nearer the center than they placed themselves. And they put Democrats in Congress at 4.3 and their ideal president at the same spot. Takeaway: Liberals see themselves as being pretty close to where they see their political leaders, and that place isn\u2019t all that far from the center.\n\nModerates saw themselves as slightly right-of-center collectively, at 5.37. Interestingly, they see Democrats in Congress at 4.08, or .92 ticks away from the dead political center of 5. But they put Republicans in Congress at 6.63, almost twice as far away from the center as they put Democrats. They placed Obama, incidentally, at 3.88\u2014a little to the left of where they put the Democrats in Congress, but still a good .51 closer to the center than they put congressional Republicans.\n\nConservatives put themselves at 7.4 on the 1-to-9 scale\u2014that is, closer to the extremist edge than to the center by almost a whole point (.8).\n\nBefore we get to conservatives, permit me this brief methodological digression. This rating system, explains Third Way\u2019s Jim Kessler, is a little like a Richter scale. That is, just as the difference between 7 and 8 on a Richter scale is much greater than the difference between 3 and 4 (because it\u2019s a \u201clogarithmic scale\u201d), so too here it\u2019s reasonable to think of the increments as more pronounced the farther they emanate out from the center. This is because far more people want to think of themselves as reasonable and kind of moderate than as extremist. So that .51 difference I cite in the paragraph above in moderates\u2019 views of Democrats and Republicans in Congress respectively is bigger than it may sound.\n\nAll right. Now. Conservatives put themselves at 7.4 on the 1-to-9 scale\u2014that is, closer to the extremist edge than to the center by almost a whole point (.8). They also put themselves more than twice as far away from the center as liberals did. They put Obama at 2.93 and Democrats in Congress at 3.42.\n\nBut here\u2019s the most important number. Self-identified conservatives put Republicans in Congress at 5.76. In other words: Conservatives see congressional Republicans as basically on the center-right! Two years ago, when Third Way first asked these questions, self-identified conservatives put themselves at the same 7.4, but they put Republicans in Congress at 5.81. Now, the difference between 5.81 and 5.76 isn\u2019t large, but it does mean that if anything, conservatives see congressional Republicans as a little more moderate than they did two years ago.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Cantor and Brat? A lot. Conservatives\u2014who, by the way, made up a whopping 79 percent of Republicans in the survey, while liberals made up just 39 percent of Democrats\u2014see a moderate-ish congressional party that is selling out their core principles. And this reflects, in turn, Brat\u2019s biggest and most fundamental criticism of Cantor, that the majority leader was a sell-out on immigration. What most of the post-outcome anecdotal analysis has been telling us is backed up precisely by these depressing and all-too-not-surprising numbers.\n\nThe upshot? Expect to see more David Brats. Yes, it\u2019s hard to beat an incumbent. The incumbent has to screw up in some of the ways Cantor did, and most of his fellow incumbents will have taken note and cut back on the Beltway gallivanting. But the logic of these things is that the tea party doesn\u2019t have to win many races to gain leverage. Up to Brat, the tea partiers lost five or six in a row. Now, they\u2019ve won just one, and every Republican on Capitol Hill is so terrified that they won\u2019t deviate an inch from the tea-party agenda. Someday, this extremism will come crashing down on them.

But Clinton\u2019s deafening and widely criticized silence since announcing her candidacy isn\u2019t a weakness or a failing on her part. It underscores exactly the professionalism, strategizing, and discipline that explain why she is atop the polls.\n\nShe has nothing to gain and everything to lose from shooting off her mouth for at least the rest of the year. Like an aging boxer who survives more by smarts than by slugging, Clinton knows that the fight for the White House is a 15-round bout that will certainly go the distance. Only a showboating chump would punch themselves out in the early rounds.\n\nSure, over the past few weeks, she\u2019s lost some ground among Democratic voters to socialist Bernie Sanders. But she\u2019s still ahead of him, not to mention the ever-growing gaggle of Republican rivals. Sure, ever since announcing she was running for president, Clinton has stayed awfully quiet, popping up in Chipotle surveillance camera footage like Patty Hearst on the lam and eschewing actual public events for \u201cintimate\u201d meetings with vetted, handpicked supporters.\n\nOn the rare occasions when she does step out of her bubble, things have gotten hinky, like when she literally roped off the press during a Fourth of July parade in New Hampshire. The optics of that scene\u2014photogs and journos being physically restrained from getting close enough to her highness to take good pics or ask embarrassing queries\u2014would be shame-inducing if not suicide-inducing to most candidates.\n\nBut do we need to spell it out, really? Hillary Clinton is not most candidates.\n\nHillary is turning into a defensive master, but on her own terms.\n\nShe\u2019s learned from the acknowledged master\u2014husband Bill, who can\u2019t even be bothered to flatly promise not to give paid speeches if he becomes First Dude\u2014that there\u2019s never a reason to give in to common decency and slink off into the dark night of political oblivion. Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t driven a car since 1996 and it\u2019s a safe bet that she hasn\u2019t felt shame for even longer.\n\nSince announcing for president, Clinton has granted exactly one televsion interview, with CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar, and smartly used the occasion to attack the Republican field for their weak-tea responses to Donald Trump\u2019s muy stupido assertion that Mexican immigrants are mostly rapists. Indicating that she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d (read: elated) \u201cin those comments,\u201d Clinton went on to note that her Republican rivals \u201care all in the same general area on immigration.\u201d\n\nThe worst part of that? She\u2019s absolutely right. Once the party of near-open borders (watch this video from 1980 in which Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush one up each other on praising the contributions of illegal immigrants), today\u2019s GOP, with minor exceptions, vilifies the wretched yearning to breathe free, at least when they come from Latin America.\n\nIn 2004, George Bush won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. Eight years later, Mitt Romney\u2014who counseled that illegal immigrants should practice \u201cself-deportation\u201d\u2014pulled just 27 percent. In the GOP \u201cautopsy\u201d of Romney\u2019s failure in 2012, the authors wrote, \u201cIf Hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn\u2019t want them in the United States, they won\u2019t pay attention to our next sentence.\u201d Given the way that the current candidates have been non-reacting to Trump, that might be the best outcome the Republican Party could hope for.\n\nAgainst such a backdrop, Clinton is right to keep mum, except when making easy layups against her opponents. Let Bernie Sanders whip Democrats into a progressive frenzy and then step in with vague nods toward equality and growth for all. She knows full well that Sanders is not her real rival\u2014that will be the GOP nominee, not a frothing-at-the-mouth socialist from a state with a population smaller than Washington, D.C.\u2019s.\n\nShe also knows as well as anyone that her toughest challenge will be sweetening the air of inevitability that surrounds her like noxious secondhand smoke. No one outside of their immediate families wants to see a Clinton-Bush contest, but such a showdown is more likely than not. She may indeed be as \u201carrogant\u201d as Commentary and a thousand other similar publications contend, but she\u2019s likely smart enough to realize that nothing humanizes her more than right-wing outlets foaming at the mouth about everything from blowjobs to Benghazi.\n\nThis is not to say that she\u2019s a perfect candidate. In fact, the roping off of journalists\u2014on a day celebrating independence, no less!\u2014suggests Hillary Clinton is in many ways singularly off-putting. Her feminist bona fides were rightly called into question during her time as First Lady, her time as senator from New York was unmemorable, and her tenure as secretary of state nothing short of disastrous. When under attack, she\u2019s capable of mind-bogglingly stupid comments, like when she started talking about Bobby Kennedy\u2019s assassination during the end days of her 2008 run for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThis is why she is smart to be running a rope-a-dope strategy, essentially letting her opponents (Democratic and Republican) punch themselves out in the early rounds. When they\u2019ve taken their best shots and mostly exhausted themselves, she can come off the ropes and throw a haymaker or two. Along with forgoing shame, this is another great tactical advantage she\u2019s learned from her husband.\n\nBill Clinton outlasted his opponents\u2014think Newt Gingrich and a gaggle of moralistic congressmen, many of whom had skeletons of their own to hide. Bill was like Muhammad Ali taking on George Foreman in the jungle heat, a personable motormouth who loved to talk and press the flesh (sometimes a bit too much, to be sure). Hillary is turning into a defensive master, but on her own terms. She\u2019s more like Floyd Mayweather, nobody\u2019s idea of a fun person to hang out with, but capable of taking huge amounts of punishment and coming off the ropes in the late rounds to secure victory.\n\nIf the eventual Republican nominee\u2014whether it\u2019s Jeb Bush or Rand Paul or god help us all Donald Trump\u2014wants a real chance at the crown, they\u2019d do best to back away from Hillary and the anger-bear rhetoric that only makes her more sympathetic. The nominee would do well to outline an actually positive and inclusive message about how they plan to guide the country into the 21st century rather than constantly harp on last century\u2019s scandals, the need for even newer and bigger wars, and protecting us from the scourge of immigrants so desperate for a better life that they\u2019re willing to risk arrest to come to America.\n\nA Republican employing positive rhetoric\u2014which is exactly how Barack Obama toppled Clinton in 2008\u2014would pull her out of her crouch and cause her to swing recklessly and wildly. In all that lunging, she\u2019d be likely to knock herself out. But so long as the Republicans keep smacking themselves in the face, she\u2019s smart to hold her punches.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:13.306+0000"}

Axelrod reports that Obama told him that the Republican presidential nominee said: \u201cYou really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee.\u201d To Obama, that was racial code: \u201c\u2018In other words, black people. That\u2019s what he thinks this was all about,\u2019\u201d the adviser recalls the president saying.\n\nBut according to one of the three people in the room with Romney when he made his concession call, the former Massachusetts governor never said anything of the kind.\n\nGarrett Jackson was Mitt Romney\u2019s personal aide for four years and notoriously press-shy. The soft-spoken Mississippian was more far comfortable in the background, handing a homemade peanut butter and honey sandwich or a Sharpie to Romney when needed, than being in the spotlight. Even after the campaign, Jackson has remained press-averse, but he decided to come forward when he saw Axelrod\u2019s account of Romney\u2019s exchange with Obama.\n\nAs Jackson described the night to The Daily Beast, once it became clear Romney was not going to win, Jackson was asked to reach out to his counterpart in the Obama campaign. Jackson and Romney retreated into a spare bedroom in the candidate\u2019s Boston hotel suite with vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan and Romney\u2019s oldest son, Tagg\n\n\u201cI called Marvin [Nicholson, Obama\u2019s body man] and asked for his boss,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThen I handed the phone to Mitt.\u201d\n\n\u201cAxelrod created enough of a lie to distort who Mitt is during the campaign. That is enough. Your guy won.\u201d\n\nJackson described a short call in which Romney congratulated the re-elected president. In Jackson\u2019s recollection, Romney \u201ccalled [the president] out, telling him he had \u2018tough decisions to make,\u2019\u201d but he followed that by saying, \u201cI\u2019m here to help however I can.\u201d\n\nRomney ended the call by telling Obama he was in both Mitt and Ann Romney\u2019s prayers. \u201cAnd that was it,\u201d Jackson said.\n\n\u201cHe definitely did not talk about Cleveland or Milwaukee,\u201d he said, noting that the information was not there at the time.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Jackson said, describing the concession call as \u201chumble.\u201d\n\nThe conversation was not on speakerphone, so Jackson couldn\u2019t hear what the president said to Romney.

{"entityId": 1616, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Yes, OK, Matt Drudge and company are just trolling when they say the president should\u2019ve shown up at the march in Paris. But the administration was still wrong to not send anyone.\n\nOkay, first of all, I do not think, and no reasonable person should think, that Barack Obama should have attended the Paris march himself. People saying this have no conception of the amount of security involved in moving the leader of the free world around. And sending him out to march along a parade route that the Secret Service doesn't know? Ridiculous. The only time\u2014ever\u2014when a president gets out of his car and walks any distance at all is on inauguration day. (Going to Ray's Hell Burger isn't the same as getting out and walking several blocks.) And the Secret Service knows every one of those buildings along Pennsylvania Avenue cold.\n\nSo, no, Obama should not have gone. There's plenty of right-wing trollery today on this point, and let me be clear, it's stupid, and it's just trollery. Obama shouldn't have gone. And ditto Joe Biden, for similar reasons\u2014even an American vice president's security detail probably is on a scale that not even European heads of state get. Either's presence would have turned the march into a security nightmare, and today everyone would be complaining about how big fat America, as usual, big-footed everybody else.\n\nBut all that doesn't mean our non-presence at the march was appropriate. Eric Holder was in town and couldn't go? John Kerry, our French-speaking secretary of state\u2014I said secretary of state, for God's sake\u2014couldn't be there? He was in India. Fine. Maybe it was just impossible from the perspective of time zones. But didn't we all know about this march days in advance, and couldn't his schedule have been adjusted? The ambassador, whoever that is, and undersecretary of state Victoria Nuland, hardly a household name, did attend.\n\n\n\nHere is what I think should have been done. I think Obama should have directed his entire Cabinet to go. That would have been an appropriate show of solidarity. Security concerns? Please. Except for two or three of them, they could all walk into the Closerie de Lilas and ask for a table and no one would have the slightest idea who they were. That would not have disrupted the event from a security perspective, and it would have sent just the right signal: that Obama knows that his presence would've been chaotic, but he took the event seriously enough to make a dramatic gesture.\n\nI think Obama should have directed his entire Cabinet to go. That would have been an appropriate show of solidarity.\n\nAnd by the way, the error here isn't just the administration's. Why didn't any senators go, or members of the House? Of course, we don't expect Republicans to be able to find Paris on a map or be willing to go anywhere near it (although don't kid yourself\u2014no person in his right mind doesn't like Paris, American conservatives included). But that's a low-expectations argument that shouldn't let them off the hook. And that goes for Democrats, too: Some contingent of American legislators should have been there.\n\nAll right. Let's run through the counter-arguments. First, that it's just symbolism and no one will remember two months from now. It may be the case that no one will remember two months from now\u2014at least in America; France is probably another matter. But that's not an argument against doing something. Very few public matters enjoy a long shelf life, but that's not an excuse for not doing the right thing in the moment.\n\nAs for symbolism, well, sometimes, it's important. A lot of my fellow liberals wanted Obama to go to Ferguson, Missouri and give a speech. That may have been \"just symbolism,\" but some people seemed to think it mattered. \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" and \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall\" were just symbolism, too. But somehow they've lived on, and it was awfully important to West Germans when American presidents uttered those words.\n\nWhy is this different? This raises the second counter-argument, which will be raised by liberals. I know that once this is posted my Twitter feed is going to be deluged by fellow liberals having at me for buying into a hate-on-Obama agenda being set by the Daily News and Matt Drudge. For the record, I was mad about this Sunday while I was watching the march, before the Daily News or Drudge said a word.\n\nBut more importantly, we can't let our entire reactions to public events boil down to \"if X says one thing, my position is the opposite.\" Yes, Drudge is trolling, and trolling idiotically, because his fire is aimed at Obama for not going, which, as I said at the top of this column, is a ridiculous criticism.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that all criticism of the mishandling of this is wrong. This was the largest civilian mobilization in the history of France. It was a huge moment. There is such a thing as solidarity\u2014as standing symbolically in defense of certain ideas.\n\nHere's how to decide where you are on this, forgetting whatever media feeding-frenzy is or is not taking place. Simply ask yourself: Given my own reactions to the murders and my own feelings about where I want my government to stand on these issues, do I as a citizen feel that I was under-represented during the one moment the world chose to make its collective statement on these matters? If not, well, okay then. But for me, yes, as a citizen, I felt horribly under-represented in Paris yesterday. And I bet lots of European\u2014and Middle Eastern\u2014liberals and humanists agree with me. I'm not worried about Matt Drudge's opinion, but I am worried about theirs.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:14.158+0000"}

Will it work?\n\nThis story was published by The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.\n\nBy Michael Beckel\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky.\u2014The most mysterious force in Kentucky\u2019s pivotal U.S. Senate race is a ghost that dwells in a hole in a wall.\n\nHunt for the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition, and one finds no grassroots army, no canvassing operation, no office or headquarters at all\u2014just a scuffed U.S. Postal Service box nestled inside a suburban shopping plaza about 10 miles from downtown Louisville.\n\nAbout the only thing nearby that smacks of politics is an adjacent pop-up Halloween costume store. There, among monsters, ghouls, and evil clowns, a vinyl President Barack Obama mask sells for $24.99\u2014the \u201cscariest one of them all,\u201d one shopper mused.\n\nCorporeal or not, the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition has nevertheless capitalized on such anti-Obama sentiment, and the freedom to largely operate with anonymity, to haunt Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes in her increasingly unlikely bid to unseat incumbent Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\nAbout one in every seven of TV ads in Kentucky\u2019s Senate race\u2014about 12,000 of the more than 79,000 ads that have aired through Monday\u2014has been sponsored by Kentucky Opportunity Coalition, which operates as a \u201csocial welfare\u201d nonprofit organization that, by law, is prohibited from making the influencing of elections its primary purpose.\n\nOnly the McConnell and Grimes campaigns themselves have aired more TV ads during what\u2019s become one of the nation\u2019s most contentious\u2014and most costly\u2014electoral battles, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG, an advertising tracking company.\n\nNo other group has had a larger footprint in Kentucky\u2019s U.S. Senate race. In fact, the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition has aired about twice as many TV ads than the next most prolific player in the contest, a pro-Grimes super PAC called Senate Majority PAC, run by allies of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV). And the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition has aired more spots than all other pro-McConnell groups combined.\n\nWhen it applied for tax-exempt status, the group told the IRS that it did not have any plans to \u201cattempt to influence\u201d any election. This year alone, the group spent at least $7 million on the Senate race.\n\nDespite having effectively no physical presence, the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition now ranks among the largest social-welfare nonprofits in Kentucky\u2014bringing in more money, according to Internal Revenue Service records, than some of Kentucky\u2019s more high-profile nonprofits, such as the Kentucky School Boards Association and the Kentucky Derby Festival, the group behind two weeks\u2019 worth of events surrounding the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThank, in part, the loosened rules on corporate electioneering following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision for Kentucky Opportunity Coalition\u2019s unexpected rise. Certain types of donor-shielding nonprofit corporations may now raise unlimited funds to advocate for and against federal political candidates, not only in Kentucky, but in any race.\n\nMore acutely, though, thank a development akin to a corporate takeover for the group\u2019s sudden prominence\u2014the addition, last year, of a former top McConnell aide who previously worked in the White House with Republican strategist Karl Rove. Until then, the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition didn\u2019t do much of anything.\n\nThat man: Scott Jennings.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s Mystery Man\n\nJennings served as the White House deputy political director in the George W. Bush administration and is a veteran of McConnell\u2019s last two re-election campaigns.\n\nNow a Louisville-based public-relations consultant, Jennings served as a \u201csenior communications adviser\u201d to McConnell\u2019s re-election campaign in 2008. Six years earlier, he worked as the McConnell campaign\u2019s \u201cpolitical and communications director.\u201d His skills have also been honed working for the GOP presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and Mitt Romney.\n\nJennings, a co-founder of the media-relations firm RunSwitch PR, said he was hired by the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition\u2019s board of directors to \u201chelp ensure the organization\u2019s message is dispersed in an efficient and effective manner.\u201d\n\nHe stressed to the Center for Public Integrity that the nonprofit \u201cabides by all rules and regulations governing an organization of its kind.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe Kentucky Opportunity Coalition seeks to bring about long-term positive change with fewer additional regulatory burdens and taxes. Its activities are all geared toward that mission.\u201d\n\nWith Jennings\u2019 assistance, the group, he said, has spent $14 million since the beginning of 2013\u2014nearly as much money as Grimes has raised\u2014though Jennings is quick to assert that \u201cmuch of the advertising was of an issue nature and has no connection to any election.\u201d\n\nBut records show the group has reported more than $7.1 million to the FEC for expenditures that \u201cexpressly advocate\u201d for election of McConnell or defeat of Grimes.\n\nIssue ads that praise or criticize a politician but fall short of overtly urging people to vote for or against them do not generally need to be reported to the FEC.\n\nThe Epitome of \u2018Dark Money\u2019\n\nThe Kentucky Opportunity Coalition appears well aware that its potential donors may want to contribute for political reasons.\n\n\u201cThis group exists to allow donors to give secret money to benefit Sen. McConnell\u2019s campaign without the public knowing who these people are.\u201d\n\nFor example, its website for months promoted the fact that donations to the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition did not count against the $123,000 aggregate limit on federal political contributions\u2014a limit that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional in April.\n\nFurthermore, every one of the 12,000-plus TV ads aired by the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition mentions either McConnell or Grimes, as does every video on the group\u2019s YouTube page.\n\nMany of these ads have praised McConnell, a five-term incumbent, for being \u201cKentucky coal\u2019s chief proponent in our nation\u2019s capital\u201d and for \u201cfighting to protect Kentucky jobs from Obama\u2019s war on coal.\u201d\n\nOthers have castigated Grimes, Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state and daughter of former Kentucky Democratic Party chairman Jerry Lundergan, as \u201ca liberal who is wrong for Kentucky\u201d and a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for Obama\u2019s political agenda.\n\nOverall, about 53 percent of the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition\u2019s TV ads have praised McConnell while the rest have attacked Grimes, according to Kantar Media/CMAG.\n\nJennings told the Center for Public Integrity that these ads have had a \u201ctremendous impact shaping the public policy environment\u201d and that his group was \u201cgrateful\u201d to have had \u201cthe resources to educate Kentuckians on a range of issues.\u201d\n\nHe declined to say who was bankrolling this advertising spree. The Kentucky Opportunity Coalition\u2019s policy is to \u201cnot provide the names of its donors to the general public,\u201d its website states.\n\nCampaign-finance reformers say the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition is the epitome of \u201cdark money\u201d nonprofit groups that have little or nothing to do with promoting social welfare, as their IRS designation would suggest.\n\n\u201cThis group for all practical purposes is simply an arm of Sen. McConnell\u2019s campaign,\u201d said Fred Wertheimer, the president of the Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group Democracy 21.\n\n\u201cThis group exists to allow donors to give secret money to benefit Sen. McConnell\u2019s campaign without the public knowing who these people are,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Federal Elections Commission tried in August to compel Kentucky Opportunity Coalition to release more information about its donors when filing mandatory expenditure reports.\n\nThe group, in response, effectively told the government\u2019s top election regulator to take a hike.\n\n\u201cKentucky Opportunity Coalition understands the applicable reporting regulations,\u201d group treasurer Caleb Crosby wrote. \u201cThe omission of contributor information on future reports should not be assumed to be an oversight.\u201d\n\nThe FEC has held that social-welfare nonprofits like the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition, which are organized under Sec. 501(c)(4) of the tax code, need only disclose the names of donors who give with the stated intent of \u201cfurthering\u201d a specific ad or expenditure.\n\nNotably, Crosby also serves as the treasurer for a number of other politically active groups, including American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, the super PAC and nonprofit co-founded by GOP strategist Rove after the Citizens United decision.\n\nThe Citizens United ruling loosened campaign-finance restrictions on corporations, including certain classes of nonprofits, which previously could not call directly for the election or defeat of federal politicians. They may now also raise unlimited amounts of money to fund such overt political messages.\n\nBoth Crosby and Jennings are also involved with a pro-McConnell super PAC known as Kentuckians for Strong Leadership, which raised $7.5 million between its formation in March 2013 and Oct. 15, 2014, according to campaign-finance filings. Super PACs, unlike politically active nonprofits, must disclose their donors to the FEC in regular filings.\n\nMany of the donors to Kentuckians for Strong Leadership have also donated to American Crossroads, including investor John W. Childs, a pioneer of the leveraged buyout, and Joe Craft, the president and chief executive officer of Alliance Resource Partners, a Tulsa-based coal giant.\n\nNeither Childs nor Craft responded to requests for comment about whether they donated money to the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition.\n\n\u2018They Understand the Game\u2019\n\nThe Kentucky Opportunity Coalition has earned accolades from some local Republicans for its increased profile and involvement in Kentucky\u2019s white-hot U.S. Senate race.\n\n\u201cThey understand the game that has to be played in order to win,\u201d said Nathan Haney, the chairman of the Louisville-based Jefferson County Republican Party. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d\n\nHaney added that he had \u201cno idea\u201d where the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition was getting its money, but, he continued, \u201cI\u2019m assuming that they have a nationwide network because they are all very well-connected people.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the McConnell campaign repeatedly dodged opportunities to discuss the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition.\n\nAt one campaign event in the northern Kentucky city of Hebron, McConnell himself was whisked away by staffers when this reporter introduced himself. And McConnell campaign spokeswoman Allison Moore did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.\n\nOnly after the mid-October debate between McConnell and Grimes in Lexington did McConnell campaign senior adviser Josh Holmes offer a curt response about the role of the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition in the race.\n\nWhen asked by the Center for Public Integrity how the senator would be faring without the group\u2019s ad blitz, Holmes said, \u201cWe\u2019d be winning just like we are right now.\u201d\n\nMost recent polls have shown McConnell with a narrow lead.\n\nMcConnell has held a wider lead in the fundraising race: Through the end of September, his campaign had raised nearly twice as much as that of Grimes\u2014$29 million versus $16 million.\n\nDespite these financial disadvantages, Grimes has kept the contest fairly close.\n\nMeteoric Rise\n\nWhen it was launched in 2008, the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition offered no indication it would morph into one of the most prominent players in the fight for Republican control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nWhen it applied for tax-exempt status as a social-welfare nonprofit, the group told the IRS that it did not have any plans to spend any money \u201cattempting to influence\u201d the election of any political candidates.\n\nIt added that it would be \u201coperated exclusively for public and social-welfare purposes.\u201d\n\nAnd it further stated that it hoped to raise nearly $2 million during its first few years of existence from \u201cindividuals and corporations.\u201d\n\nLarge donors would receive \u201cinvitations to policy conferences, dinners and premier events and \u201cpreferred seating and reception access\u201d at Kentucky Opportunity Coalition events.\n\nThat funding, however, never materialized.\n\nBetween its formation in 2008 and the end of 2012, the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition never reported more than $50,000 in annual receipts, according to tax records. Press releases show it briefly advocated against a prevailing wage for education projects in 2009 before falling off the radar.\n\n\u201cThe organization really did not have a tremendous amount of legs in its early years,\u201d said David Mast, a lobbyist who served on its board when it first launched.\n\nBut its current officers aren\u2019t eager to talk about the group\u2019s sudden rise.\n\nMum\u2019s the Word\n\nThree Republican women\u2014Kristen Webb, Bridget Bush, and Karen Sellers\u2014compose the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition\u2019s current board of directors.\n\nAll have been involved with the organization since its founding, according to records.\n\nWebb, the group\u2019s chairwoman, is a Louisville-based attorney who previously worked in state government.\n\nDuring the 2000s, she worked for Kentucky\u2019s Finance and Administration Cabinet, which is the primary support agency for state government. She also served on Kentucky\u2019s Registry of Election Finance, the state\u2019s election and campaign-finance regulator.\n\nBush, too, is a Louisville-based attorney.\n\nIn 2012, Bush was the lead counsel associated with the amicus brief of Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) in the legal fight over the constitutionality of the individual mandate in Obama\u2019s health-care reform law.\n\nShe was a founding member of the Louisville lawyer\u2019s chapter of the Federalist Society, of which her husband, attorney John K. Bush, is the president. Her favorite books, according to her profile on a blogging website, include the Bible and Ayn Rand\u2019s Atlas Shrugged.\n\nSellers, meanwhile, is the assistant to the president and CEO of the Highlands Regional Medical Center in Prestonsburg, in eastern Kentucky. She also chairs the board of directors of the Big Sandy Technical and Community College in Prestonsburg.\n\nNone responded to requests for comment. After phone calls and emails went unanswered, the Center for Public Integrity also attempted to contact Webb and Bush at their homes in Louisville.\n\nJohn Bush, returning from walking the family\u2019s dogs, said that his wife was \u201cunavailable.\u201d\n\nNo one answered the door at Webb\u2019s stately, two-story brick home\u2014a handsome structure that Jefferson County values at $767,500.\n\nJennings, the public-relations consultant who serves as the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition\u2019s spokesman, declined to comment on their behalf.\n\n\u201cI believe you have been trying to contact our board members,\u201d he wrote in an email to the Center for Public Integrity. \u201cI will be the only person commenting for the group.\u201d\n\nUp for Sale?\n\nOn the campaign trail, Grimes has slammed McConnell as \u201cMr. Citizens United\u201d and has criticized the \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d who are trying to help \u201cbuy Mitch McConnell\u2019s way back to Washington.\u201d\n\nOn a rainy Tuesday afternoon in the northern Kentucky city of Florence in mid-October, Grimes reminded her supporters that the \u201chearts and minds of Kentuckians\u201d cannot be bought\u2014even if the airwaves can.\n\nMcConnell and his allies have aired nearly three TV ads for every two from Grimes and her allies over the course of the campaign, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG covering spending through Oct. 27, though in recent weeks that gap has narrowed.\n\nSince the start of September, McConnell and his supporters have aired about 20,800 ads compared to the approximately 17,400 aired by Grimes and groups backing her. That\u2019s about one TV ad every four minutes for Team Mitch versus about one every five minutes for Team Alison.\n\nSuper PACs have aided both candidates, but Grimes has less dark-money support than McConnell.\n\nLiberal-aligned nonprofits such as the Vote Vets Action Fund and Patriot Majority USA have made modest ad buys on Grimes\u2019 behalf, while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Crossroads GPS have both joined the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition on the air in support of McConnell\u2019s re-election bid.\n\nWhen asked by the Center for Public Integrity about the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition, Grimes remarked that the group\u2019s initials are just \u201cone letter shy of Koch brothers\u201d\u2014a swipe at conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, whose political network has spent millions of dollars aiding GOP politicians across the country this year.\n\nIn the home stretch of the campaign, she\u2019s resolute in the face of whatever dark money the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition spends against her.\n\n\u201cThis election won\u2019t be bought,\u201d Grimes said. \u201cOur democracy isn\u2019t up for sale.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2014 The Center for Public Integrity", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:14.535+0000"}

That\u2019s clearly what we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\n\n\nO\u2019Doherty went on to say that although he describes himself as \u201ca great admirer of Hillary Clinton [and] President Clinton,\u201d the current state of affairs in America is \u201can indictment of the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that Governor Martin O\u2019Malley is going to be an outstanding generational alternative to those policies of the past and the leaders that got us here,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the public doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel we should be going back to the policies that treats the presidency of the United States like a crown to the passed between two families,\u201d which is something O\u2019Malley has himself said, almost verbatim.\n\nSo far, that\u2019s as close as O\u2019Malley has gotten to actually criticizing Clinton.\n\nAnd perhaps that strategy is a smart one: In recent months, O\u2019Malley has climbed from 1 to 3 percent in the polls (although at least one of those polls had a margin of error of 4 percent).\n\nWith those numbers, the only way to go is up.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:14.792+0000"}

Why they need to follow Chuck Schumer\u2019s example and take on the issue.\n\nIf you number yourself among my longer-suffering readers, you may know that one of the occasional hobbyhorses I ride for 800 words is my immense frustration that Democrats are terrified of defending government. Oh, some of them do sometimes. But mostly they defend ends, not means. That is: They defend this or that program or policy goal, but they don\u2019t defend the vehicle that provides it, the federal government.\n\nNow you are already sitting at your whetstone, sharpening your knife, ready to instruct me in all the reasons it would be preposterous for the Democrats to do this. I know the reasons already. But they\u2019re wrong. Because look, folks: The Democrats are the party of government. It\u2019s the basic reason a person is a Democrat in the first place\u2014Democrats disagree about loads of things, but the one principle they all subscribe to is a belief that the federal government can and must intervene in the economic and social spheres to even things out. And the rejection of that belief is the basic reason a person is a Republican.\n\nSo government is the fundamental dividing line. And yet, for the past 30 years, what kind of debate about this have we had? We\u2019ve had one side relentlessly attacking government as incompetent to evil, and the other side saying nothing, being too cowed to stand up and say that government is, and does, good. Elected officials don\u2019t do it, and even the progressive political professionals don\u2019t do it.\n\nDemocrats will never be the consensus-majority party again, as they were when I was born and when Chuck Schumer was a youngster, until they do take on this fight again, and win it.\n\nThink of this: Of all the dozens of groups out there that make up what we call the liberal infrastructure, the think thanks and interest-group nonprofits and so on, there is not a single entity whose goal is the defense of government. Given this, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable that such large majorities think the government is awful, because you have the government haters telling them for three decades how awful government is and the government defenders saying nothing.\n\nThat is the real importance of Chuck Schumer\u2019s speech last week. (There appears to be no full text available online, but you can watch it here). The central message has been crowded out to some extent by Schumer\u2019s comments about how the president and the party should have concentrated on middle class economic matters before pursuing health-care reform, which other Democrats have criticized him for (and which he\u2019s said before, incidentally). If all you know about the speech is that, then you might have a negative impression of it. I implore you to watch it, because it\u2019s better than that.\n\nSchumer has been careful over the years to keep his distance from his party\u2019s liberals, although he\u2019s also not a conservative; he\u2019s a straddler. And he\u2019s not an Elizabeth Warren-style populist. And the federal government is about as popular as syphilis. So it\u2019s striking to hear Schumer say: \u201cTogether, Democrats must embrace government. It\u2019s what we believe in; it\u2019s what unites our party; and, most importantly; it\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s going to get the middle class going again. If we run away from government, downplay it, or act as if we are embarrassed by its role, people won\u2019t vote for our pale version of the Republican view; they\u2019ll vote for the real McCoy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s even more striking to hear someone like Schumer, known for relationships with Wall Street and traditionally one of the big banks\u2019 best friends among Washington Democrats, argue that defending government means not just defending programs but using government\u2019s regulatory and even prosecutorial power to check private-sector rapacity: \u201cWe must first prove that the era of big corporate influence over government is over. Big business, big banks, big oil\u2014they may be allowed a seat at the table, but right now Americans feel that big special interests are buying the whole room and renting it out for profit. When government panders to these forces, and lobbyists and lawyers carve out ridiculous loopholes that amount to taxpayer-funded kickbacks to corporations, Americans feel that government is not working for them. When government fails to prosecute those who work in financial institutions (some of which were propped up or bailed out by the government) for what seems, on its face, blatant fraud, Americans feel that government is not working for them.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s pretty amazing stuff coming from him. But it, too, like the Obamacare business, isn\u2019t really his main point. The big idea in the speech is that Democrats have to come up with ways to show the middle class how the party will put the government to work in their behalf. I agree, but I would add that there\u2019s another, prior job, which is simply to explain to middle-class people the dozens of ways in which the federal government already helps them and their communities but about which they have no idea.\n\nThis is what infuriates me, what the Democrats and the progressive political experts have done such a pathetic job at explaining to people. There are certain things that everyone knows the government takes the lead on\u2014highways probably being the most obvious. But who cleans lakes and streams and rivers and makes them fishable and swimmable again? Who reduces smog, acid rain, lead poisoning? Who cleans up toxic waste sites? Who builds (or provides a lot of the money to build) senior citizen centers and community swimming pools and all manner of recreational facilities? Who sends millions of research and other dollars to universities and colleges across the country, from Harvard to small community colleges, pumping up local economies all over America? Who helps build convention centers and adjacent hotels so cities can attract convention business? And on and on and on and on and on. Most people go through their lives taking frequent advantage of these investments and amenities but never giving a second\u2019s thought to the idea that the government made them possible. Most of them just think that lake cleaned itself somehow over the years.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just that the average American doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s that no one knows the exact extent. I once got an idea to do a big article choosing three small- to medium-size American cities more or less at random, just from different parts of the country, and trying to put a number on what the presence of the federal government in their communities meant to them. I started calling around. Oh, this will be impossible, I was told. No one keeps such numbers. You\u2019d have to call every different agency of government, and even then many of them probably won\u2019t have it broken down regionally.\n\nWell, someone damn well should collect such numbers, and that someone should make damn well sure that the people of Ocala, Florida, and St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sioux Falls, Iowa, know about every dollar. This hatred of government we see in this country is sickeningly childish and hypocritical. The rot starts from the top\u2014the appalling Republican members of Congress who voted against the 2009 stimulus and then had the audacity to go cut ribbons in their districts at venues given life because of that very stimulus bill they traduced as Satan\u2019s handiwork.\n\nBut it extends down to the millions of people who accept and applaud the right-wing rhetoric even as they suck on the government tit every day of their lives in one way or another, either without knowing it or (worse) knowing it but denying that they do because they\u2019ve stuffed their own heads full of some nonsense narrative about how tough and independent they are.\n\nThis is the fight. Government\u2019s role in people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s a fight Democrats have been, for pretty much my whole adult lifetime, utterly petrified at the thought of having to take on. But they will never be the consensus-majority party again, as they were when I was born and when Chuck Schumer was a youngster, until they do take on this fight again, and win it.\n\nUntil Americans\u2019 minds are changed about government, the domestic politics game will be played on fundamentally Republican turf. It\u2019ll take time, a generation maybe, but it can happen. Schumer deserves a lot of credit for being the first who was willing to say it.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:15.103+0000"}
{"entityId": 1620, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The High Court struck down Prop 8 a year ago this week. And my, how conservatives minds have changed.\n\nA year ago this week, the Supreme Court struck down Proposition 8, a ballot measure in California that tried ban same-sex marriage in the state. In the lower court decision (which now governs after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling), Judge Vaughn Walker wrote, \u201cAnimus towards gays and lesbians or simply a belief that a relationship between a man and a woman is inherently better than a relationship between two men or two women, this belief is not a proper basis on which to legislate.\u201d Proper? No. Constitutional? No. Upholding the values of equality and dignity for all that are the essence of our nation\u2019s aspirations? Certainly not. But that didn\u2019t stop backers of Prop 8 from making outlandish and offensive claims to push their agenda.\n\nYet fast forward and some of those virulent supporters of banning marriage equality have softened, if not outright changed their position. Let\u2019s have a look at some prominent ones.\n\nNewt Gingrich\n\nMy CNN colleague Newt Gingrich was Republican Speaker of the House when the Defense of Marriage Act was signed into law. In 2008, Gingrich produced a video supporting Prop 8 as a way to \u201cstop imperial judges\u201d and \u201cprotect marriage.\u201d\n\nBut by 2012, Gingrich had\u2026 I think the popular word today is evolved. \u201cThe momentum is clearly now in the direction in finding some way to \u2026 accommodate and deal with reality. And the reality is going to be that in a number of American states \u2014 and it will be more after 2014 \u2014 gay relationships will be legal, period,\u201d Gingrich told the Huffington Post . He said he still believes marriage is \u201cdefined as being between a man and a woman\u201d but, according to the article, \u201csuggested that the party (and he himself) could accept a distinction between a \u2018marriage in a church from a legal document issued by the state\u2019 \u2014 the latter being acceptable.\u201d Gingrich is not exactly wearing rainbow spandex, but his position definitely shifted.\n\nDavid Frum\n\nDavid Frum is known as a conservative apostate, but not on every issue\u2014he strongly opposes the immigration reform bill that passed the Senate, for example. So it once was with same-sex marriage. Way back in 1997, Frum wrote , \u201cIf we can give serious consideration to gay marriage today, it is only because we have lived through an intellectual revolution that has eroded society's understanding of the difference between a marriage and a love affair.\u201d\n\nWhen voters in California went to the ballot box to decide on Prop 8, there was only one state (Massachusetts) that recognized marriage between gay couples. Today, 19 states plus the District of Columbia have full marriage equality.\n\nBy 2008, the year of Prop 8, Frum struck a more pragmatic tone , \u201c[S]tate courts have set in motion a cultural conflict that will embitter Americans and pit them against each other for years. It\u2019s now too late to prevent it and too baffling to imagine how to resolve it. So we are left with the even more daunting problem of finding ways to contain and mitigate it.\u201d Not much softer, but softer.\n\nBut by 2011, Frum had entirely \u201cevolved.\u201d In an essay for CNN and follow up for The Daily Beast, Frum explains that he changed his tune basically because the rise in gay marriages didn\u2019t lead to a crumbling of civilization.\n\nFrum wrote , \u201cAs a conservative concerned with stabilizing families to rely less on government aid, I have been convinced: I've been worrying about the wrong thing. Stopping same-sex marriages does nothing to support families battered by economic adversity. Instead, it excludes and punishes people who seek only to live as conservatives would urge them to live.\u201d Frum is embracing pulling gay folks into a socially conservative, hetero-normative version of marriage that makes me cringe , but regardless, the point is Frum pivoted, too.\n\nMeg Whitman\n\nWhen the former eBay executive ran for Governor of California in 2010, Meg Whitman was explicit in her support for Prop 8. And she criticized Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and then-Attorney General Jerry Brown for not defending the ballot measure in the mounting legal challenges. In fact, the media hinted that Whitman took such a staunch anti-marriage equality stance to shore up her credentials with conservatives angered by her support for immigration reform and vow to address climate change.\n\nBut in 2013, Whitman was one of more than 75 prominent conservatives who signed a legal brief opposing Prop 8. Whitman, who lost the California governor\u2019s race, explained, \u201cI have come to embrace same-sex marriage after a period of careful review and reflection.\u201d Like Frum, Whitman emphasized the conservative norms of marriage in rationalizing her shift: \u201cIt makes no difference whether the marriage is between a man and woman or a woman and woman. Marriage makes society better.\"\n\nJohn Huntsman\n\nThis one is particularly interesting. After all, Huntsman \u2014 former Governor of Utah, Ambassador to China, and Republican candidate for President in 2012 \u2014 is a Mormon, just like Mitt Romney. Romney heftily supported Prop 8 \u2014 in 2008, his political action committee made a $10,000 under-the-radar donation to support Prop 8 and other anti-marriage equality advocacy.\n\nAs of 2011, Huntsman wasn\u2019t backing marriage equality: \u201cI believe in traditional marriage first and foremost. [...] But I also believe in civil unions.\u201d But Huntsman was one of the conservatives who signed the Supreme Court amicus brief against Prop 8. In a 2013 essay, Huntsman wrote, \u201cThe party of Lincoln should stand with our best tradition of equality and support full civil marriage for all Americans.\u201d\n\nRomney, it should be noted, has not evolved .\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting plenty of other conservatives, those directly involved with Prop 8 or on the periphery, have not evolved \u2014 John McCain , Rick Warren , Laura Ingraham and Bill O\u2019Reilly to name a few. Some other conservatives maybe haven\u2019t changed their core beliefs but have certainly softened their opposition, including Glenn Beck , Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sean Hannity , who on his website wrote, \u201cWhile there is a lot of fervor over this issue right now, this is not a priority for the American people. That's not to belittle those who feel passionately about the issue, but Americans overall are not concerned about gay marriage as much as they are about the economy, jobs, and the debt.\u201d Perhaps the worn-down enemy of equality is equality\u2019s friend?\n\nOr maybe conservatives are just pragmatic. Since Prop 8 was passed in the fall of 2008, the country has shifted seismically with respect to marriage equality. On November 4, 2008, when voters in California went to the ballot box to decide on Prop 8, there was only one state (Massachusetts) that recognized marriage between gay couples. California\u2019s Supreme Court had also earlier in 2008 ruled in favor of marriage equality, partly prompting the ballot measure. Today , 19 states plus the District of Columbia have full marriage equality \u2014 and in 12 additional states, judges have ruled in favor of marriage equality and action on those decisions is pending appeals. In 2008 , just 40 percent of Americans believed that marriage between same-sex couples should be fully and equally recognized under the law. Today, more than 55 percent of Americans support marriage equality.\n\nAccording to one study, one in seven Americans reports changing her or his mind about marriage equality. More importantly, more than a quarter of marriage equality supporters say they have changed their minds on the issue. In other words, support for marriage equality is literally and measurably moving in the right direction.\n\nAnd hopefully more and more conservatives will vocally stand up on the side of equality \u2014 or at least stop loudly shouting against it.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:15.653+0000"}

This isn\u2019t about the winning\u2014it\u2019s about the game.)\n\nThe result is a partisan stalemate in which neither side will blink.\n\nAnd once again, this was all by design.\n\nThis showdown was set up at the end of 2014 with the debate over \u201cthe Cromnibus,\u201d the controversial budget bill that funded the government for most of 2015.\n\nMany conservative Republicans were loath to agree to any measure that funded the government didn\u2019t overturn the executive orders.\n\nDemocrats refused to go along with anything other than a bill that funded DHS and omitted the executive order language.\n\nThe language would go beyond the controversial executive order that Obama issued in 2014 to allow 5 million undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States and also apply to the \u201cDREAMers,\u201d a subset of illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States while they were underage and have clean criminal records. DREAMers were allowed to stay in the United States in an executive order that the administration issued in 2012.\n\nTo avoid another government shutdown, a compromise was reached before lawmakers went home for the holidays.\n\nMost of the federal government would be funded for a year but the DHS would only receive sufficient appropriations to last through the end of February.\n\nThe idea was that conservatives could force their standoff on immigration then and surely, no one would want to let the government agency responsible for keeping the United States safe go dark.\n\nBut, of course, that is not the case.\n\nTo add more futility to their cause, the DHS will keep on running even without being funded. Workers in key agencies like the Border Patrol and the Transportation Safety Administration are considered \u201cessential\u201d and will report to work regardless\u2014they just won\u2019t be paid to do their jobs.\n\nWhile many other DHS employees could be furloughed, this limitation prevents a shutdown from turning into an immediate crisis and reduces the cost.\n\nOn Sunday, House Speaker John Boehner seemed ready to embrace a potential shutdown and unwilling to consider a compromise.\n\nHe told Fox News, \u201cThe House has acted. We\u2019ve done our job.\u201d Boehner then said, \u201cSenate Democrats are the ones putting us in this precarious position. It\u2019s up to Senate Democrats to get their act together.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Senate Democrats who think shutting down the DHS is a bad idea. Senate Republicans\u2014John McCain, Jeff Flake and Mark Kirk, to name a few\u2014also have expressed problems with using the DHS as a way to tweak the president.\n\nThe impasse is also handing Senate Democrats a powerful political weapon.\n\nIn a statement last week Democratic Minority Leader Harry Reid said, \u201cThe Republican Congress is a mess, pure and simple. Democrats are happy to help our Republican colleagues resolve their problems but the first step is for Republican leaders to do the right thing and pass a clean bill to fund Homeland Security.\u201d\n\nThe political dilemma for Republicans is that while a shutdown plays well with their base, it gives them relatively little leverage.\n\nMost key functions of the DHS will be funding regardless and the result of past GOP brinkmanship is that Republicans are likely to bear the burden of the blame for any shutdown.\n\nIt also creates peculiar consequences in the 2016 presidential race as well.\n\nIt combines two delicate political issues of immigration reform and a government shutdown into one package and places more moderate GOP hopefuls in a bind.\n\nDo they want to let what Republicans universally believe is an unconstitutional executive order by the Obama administration stand or do they want to be put in a position of cutting funding to the DHS in the aftermath of a wave of Islamist terror attacks against American allies and interests.\n\nThe result is a familiar dysfunction.\n\nDemocrats won\u2019t yield on Obama\u2019s executive orders\u2014a move that would risk undermining one of the most important actions of the president\u2019s second term and lead to the potential deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nRepublicans can\u2019t alienate their conservative base yet again by compromising on what has become such a point of principle.\n\nThis latest episode might frustrating in the short term but, like the last shutdown, it has a predictable end:\n\nIt\u2019s not a question of whether Republicans will cave and fund the DHS, but when.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:16.527+0000"}
{"entityId": 1622, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "So Cleveland is where it\u2019s at. Republicans meeting there in 2016 need to get that and offer a program that\u2019s less Mississippi and more Ohio.\n\nFor the moment, Cleveland is looking like the city at the center of the universe. Last Tuesday, the Republican National Committee announced that Cleveland will host the GOP\u2019s 2016 convention, and three days later LeBron James let the world know that he will be returning to play for the Cavaliers, ending his sojourn in Miami. Not surprisingly, there is already talk of how a protracted NBA season for the Cavs could impact the GOP\u2019s convention plans. If only.\n\nLike much of the Rust Belt, Cleveland has seen better days. In 1940 Cleveland was America\u2019s sixth-largest city, and home to more than 878,000; these days Cleveland is down to under 400,000. In 1978, Cleveland defaulted on a $20 million bank loan, but managed to avoid filing for bankruptcy\u2014which puts it ahead of Detroit, which filed for bankruptcy last summer, and had hosted the GOP 1980 convention.\n\nStill, as the GOP prepares for its convention, the party should be ready to have something to say to the Rust Belt, because what once was a fairly welcoming place for the national GOP is no longer the case.\n\nMichigan and Pennsylvania last voted Republican in 1988, while in the past six presidential elections, Ohio has gone Democratic four times. Two years ago, Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney in Ohio by a relatively narrow 160,000 votes, but Obama\u2019s winning margin in Cuyahoga County\u2014whose county seat is Cleveland\u2014was more than 235,000 votes. Cleveland may have shrunk, but it remains relevant both numerically and as a cautionary tale.\n\nTo put things perspective, Obama\u2019s win in Ohio came on the heels of the state\u2019s enactment of a strict voter identification law in 2011. For Republicans, things didn\u2019t exactly work out as planned. Instead of suppressing turnout, the law seemed to spur people to go to the polls. Why get just mad, when you can also get even?\n\nStill, there is hope for the Republicans in the Rust Belt\u2014if they can give the public a reason to vote for them. Although Republican presidential candidates can\u2019t seem to catch a break in the Midwest, the GOP still manages to win statewide races there, unlike California and New York, which are lost causes and don\u2019t look like they are coming back anytime soon. Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania all have Republican governors, while Ohio and Pennsylvania each send a Republican senator to Washington, and Ohio\u2019s John Boehner is the Speaker of the House.\n\nPart of the national Republicans\u2019 problem is cultural, part of it is regional, and part of it is programmatic, or lack of one to be clear. A campaign message that plays well at 11 o\u2019clock on a Sunday morning in South Carolina is great for South Carolina, but it\u2019s not what the Rust Belt wants to hear on Election Day. With Hillary Clinton waiting in the wings on the Democratic side, the Republicans need to recalibrate quickly. Betting on economic catastrophe is not a campaign strategy.\n\nSo instead of just Obama-bashing from now through 2016, the GOP should be talking programs. Musing about impeachment is both stupid and bad politics. Lest anyone need a refresher, impeachment cost the Republicans seats in the 1998 midterms, as well Newt Gingrich\u2019s job as speaker.\n\nRepublicans need to start speaking about jobs, roads, and infrastructure. Heck, Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution expressly empowers Congress to establish roads.\n\nRather, the Republicans need to start talking about jobs, roads, and infrastructure. Contrary to what Jim DeMint and the Heritage Foundation may say, that stuff is as American as apple pie. Heck, Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution expressly empowers Congress to establish roads. It is also a matter of political necessity if the Republicans want to expand their appeal beyond the usual suspects.\n\nRight now, unemployment is on the way down, but the economy\u2019s victims outnumber its winners. Clinton leads all Republican rivals nationally and is ahead among white college graduates. Yet, those same polls show Clinton struggling to stay even in the Midwest, and lagging among white voters without four-year degrees. In fact, the Midwest is the only region where Clinton lacks a definite lead. (She\u2019s actually pretty strong in the South, where the African-American vote is propping her up well against GOP contenders.)\n\nIn other words, all is not lost for the GOP. There is an army of the disaffected who might just be willing to listen to the Republicans if the offer were right. After all, politics is transactional.\n\nTalking about home and hearth might feel satisfying to the Republican field and comforting to the Republican rank and file, but that\u2019s not going to be enough for a win. On the other hand, offering concrete proposals to rebuild our roads, bridges, and infrastructure may have actual appeal to a broad swath of the country.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was the first Republican president, and in addition to winning the Civil War and ending slavery, Lincoln also successfully pushed for the transcontinental railroad, which was completed after his death. Fast-forward to 1956 when Dwight Eisenhower, another Republican president, signed into law the legislation that made the interstate highway system a reality.\n\nFor the United States, the railroad, the automobile, and the highway meant lots of things, things like jobs, growth, and freedom of the road. It has also meant a better life for all of us.\n\nJudging from the headlines, Cleveland is thrilled to see LeBron return home.

{"entityId": 1623, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "What you need to do if you don\u2019t want all your secrets blasted around the Internet.\n\nRecently, I got doxxed. That means some troll found my personal information and posted it online, presumably so his fellow trolls could harass me offline like they already do on.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re really, really lucky, maybe you\u2019ll never have to know more about doxxing than that. But the whole episode got me thinking about \u201cdigital hygiene\u201d\u2014what should be posted online, what shouldn\u2019t be, and what sort of regular check-ups one should do to ensure basic privacy and safety. All of which led me to the guy I\u2019m convinced is the digital equivalent of Olivia Pope, Darius M. Fisher.\n\nFisher is the president of Status Labs, which is sort of an Olivia Pope & Associates for the Internet. Fisher and his team make a business of handling online crises and fixing digital reputations\u2014inoculating clients where possible in advance or else repairing damage after the fact. I spent a few hours with Fisher one morning and he walked me through all the possible aspects of digital hygiene. His checklist includes basic things everyone online should be thinking about plus some extra tips for anyone with a slightly higher profile, whether in business or media or some other field.\n\n1. REMOVE YOUR PERSONAL DATA ONLINE\n\nAs far as Fisher\u2019s concerned, whether you\u2019re a public figure or not you don\u2019t want things like your phone number or home address accessible online. In practical terms, what that means is that you have to get your information removed from \u201cdata brokers\u201d like PeopleSmart, Spokeo, Pipl, Intelius, Zoominfo, and Whitepages. Those are the main ones (though there are dozens of others) and each has a specific process whereby you can opt out of their database, which in turn sells your personal information to anyone who pays for it (yes, these companies are making money off your identity). But since their databases repopulate throughout the year, you\u2019ll have to do this frequently. It should be part of your seasonal digital hygiene, performed every quarter.\n\nIn addition if you own a website that can be linked to your name (for instance, sallykohn.com) you want to make sure you register the domain name privately. And incidentally, everyone should own their own domain name or closely related domain names but especially if you\u2019re at risk of imposters (see, e.g., what Michael Bloomberg did here). Either way, you can pay extra to make sure your address and personal information can\u2019t be found on the ICANN WHOIS database. And yes, you have to pay extra. As Fisher jokes, \u201cPrivacy isn\u2019t free.\u201d\n\nMake sure your privacy settings match your needs. And if you wouldn\u2019t want the whole world to see something, don\u2019t post it.\n\n2. CHANGE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA PRIVACY SETTINGS\n\nFisher is very aggressive about social media privacy; unless you\u2019re a public figure or someone with a business case for making posts public, Fisher argues your Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts should all be private. If you\u2019re even on them at all. Personally, I take a different though equally dim view\u2014I assume there is no privacy, whatever the settings say, so I won\u2019t post anything on social media that I\u2019m not 100 percent comfortable with being 100 percent public. Because you never know when a friend is going to take something and repost it for everyone to see, I protect myself by never presuming privacy.\n\nEither way, the key thing is to think about social media\u2019s potential ramifications. If you\u2019re a high net worth individual, don\u2019t tweet details about your family vacation on a lazy island somewhere so that kidnappers can come steal you for ransom. If you have a violent ex who you don\u2019t want to find you, don\u2019t post your run routes on Facebook no matter how private you think your settings are. Use common sense. Make sure your privacy settings match your needs. And if you wouldn\u2019t want the whole world to see something, don\u2019t post it.\n\n3. CHANGE YOUR PASSWORDS FREQUENTLY\n\nAlso at least four times a year, Fisher advises changing your passwords on social media and other key accounts like online banking. And you\u2019ve heard this a million times, but use a very different password for each login and don\u2019t use passwords that can be easily guessed.\n\nHow the hell are you supposed to remember all these new, mutli-number and symbol complex passwords you\u2019re constantly changing? I asked Fisher about the programs out there that supposedly save your passwords, or even generate them for you and save them, under digital lock and key. He pointed out one such company that had just been hacked. \u201cJust write them on a piece of paper and put them in a drawer at home,\u201d Fisher advised. Which, I\u2019m embarrassed to say, I\u2019d never thought of before. I\u2019m always forgetting my passwords and then forgetting how to decipher the cryptic messages I\u2019ve written to myself on my computer to remind me what the passwords are because I can\u2019t actually put the password anywhere on my computer because that would be dumb. A pen and a piece of paper and a drawer. Genius!\n\n4. GOOGLE YOURSELF\n\nOkay, this is where we move from preventative to proactive. In a digital world, it\u2019s important to know what people see when they Google you\u2014whether they\u2019re considering hiring you for a job or checking you out before a first date. So you want to Google yourself, regularly, to see what they see. The key thing is to do so from a logged out browser (Chrome, for instance, has a log-in feature \u2014 so you want to be logged-out) and also not signed into Google or Gmail or anything else that customizes your search. Then you want to clear your browser history. Then do a search and you\u2019ll see what other people see when they search you.\n\nAnother pro tip from Fisher\u2014if you live in one place but are, say, applying for a job somewhere else, you can customize your Google search by location. Under the Google search bar, click \u201cSearch Tools\u201d and you can change the location for anywhere in the world. It didn\u2019t change the results much for me, but if there was a local news story about someone with your name that comes up in Dubuque, Iowa, but not when you search at home in Idaho, you\u2019d wanna know about it.\n\nDon\u2019t like your results? There\u2019s something you can do about it. First, if you don\u2019t own it already, buy your own domain name and create a website\u2014at the very least, a simple placeholder page with a digital version of your resume. Fisher says Google\u2019s search algorithms recognize personal domain name websites and prioritize those in search results. It\u2019s why, for instance, my own website comes up first in searches for my name and Wikipedia comes second.\n\nIn addition, you can try to push up other pages in your search by linking to them on your own website, asking friends to do so, posting links on social media and more. Beyond that, though, this is where a firm like Status Labs can help\u2014offering professional services on search engine optimization to make sure that the links you want are coming up higher in the search and pushing down the others.\n\n5. AND IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG\u2026\n\nBefore you\u2019re in a position for someone to even want to exploit your online photos or personal information, you should do a thorough housecleaning. In fact, even if you\u2019re just applying for a new job in the mailroom it\u2019s good to go back through your recent social media posts and delete any that may be less-than-flattering. Better yet, don\u2019t post them in the first place.\n\nBut if you are hacked or doxxed or such, rule No. 1 is stay calm. \u201cThey want you to panic and overreact,\u201d says Fisher. \u201cThat\u2019s their goal.\u201d So don\u2019t let them win by freaking out and potentially drawing even more attention to their bad acts.\n\nThen make sure you take screenshots of everything and if there are any security threats (death threats, threats of violence, etc.) report them to police and the FBI immediately. If your personal data has been posted on Twitter or Reddit, you can file complaints to have those users suspended. Women Action and the Media has great resources here.\n\nAnd then change every single password in your network. Plus, if your home phone number was made public and you start getting annoying calls or, worse, harassing calls, Fisher says change your number, immediately. There are new troll tactics of using someone\u2019s phone number to inundate them with pizza deliveries or, worse, dispatch SWAT teams. You don\u2019t want that.\n\nIn fact, changing your number may be the least of it. Fisher predicts that over the next few decades we\u2019ll see more and more people changing their entire names as Millennials who were far too lax with social media in their teens and 20s realizes those histories can\u2019t entirely be erased in their 30s and 40s.\n\nIn general, having more and more of our information and lives accessible online is mostly wonderful but fraught with potential perils and pitfalls. All the more reason for all of us to get our digital house in order right now.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:17.861+0000"}
{"entityId": 1624, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Kudos to Ex-Mayor Mike, whose Harvard commencement address called for inclusion of more conservatives in higher education.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg shocked the conscience of many in academia (and liberal newsrooms) across America when he spoke out against the scarcity of conservative voices in faculty lounges in our leading institutions of higher education. Bloomberg\u2019s speech resonated strongly with me as I\u2019ve taught at two of the schools he mentioned in his remarks\u2014my alma mater, Haverford College, as well as the Institute of Politics at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, where I served as a resident fellow in 2011. In the relevant section of his remarks, delivered at Harvard, Bloomberg began by observing:\n\nGreat universities must not become predictably partisan. And a liberal arts education must not be an education in the art of liberalism. The role of universities is not to promote an ideology. It is to provide scholars and students with a neutral forum for researching and debating issues\u2014without tipping the scales in one direction, or repressing unpopular views.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s remarks struck a chord with me, as I think many of our colleges and universities promote a strong liberal ideology where the views of conservatives are not only not welcome, but the number of conservative faculty members is often miniscule. I should know\u2014I\u2019ve experienced the elitist condescension first-hand as a conservative faculty member by those who were stunned that I would deign to differ from liberal ideology.\n\nI\u2019ve had the privilege of returning to Haverford twice as a visiting professor of political science in 2009 and 2011. I taught a course on how Washington D.C. really operates on either end of Pennsylvania Avenue\u2014from the Congress to the White House, with stops on K Street to discuss the influence of special interest-group lobbying as well as the 24/7 cable news outlets insatiable appetite for news. Upon my first stint at Haverford, my favorite faculty member from the political science department from my days as a student had the temerity to ask me where Haverford had gone wrong with me\u2014how could I have ever returned as a professor who held conservative views? How could I have worked for President George Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney?\n\nHer comment was only to be repeated in one version or another by several faculty members during my two semesters back on campus. The view from the Ivory Tower in which diverse views are welcome and tolerated has devolved into a hostile workplace environment for anyone who would dare not march lockstep in the view that liberalism is right and conservative views are evil and misguided. Two conservative faculty members at Haverford told me that they keep their political views to themselves lest they be ostracized by their fellow denizens in the faculty lounge. Hardly encouraging, that those claiming to be open-minded and tolerant have created an atmosphere where conservative faculty members feel their perspective is not welcome.\n\nTwo conservative faculty members at Haverford told me that they keep their political views to themselves lest they be ostracized by their fellow denizens in the faculty lounge.\n\nOne of the more memorable exchanges I had with one of my Haverford students at the end of my course in 2011 is both delightful and upsetting at the same time. She observed that while I was a strong conservative who had worked with Bush and Cheney, I never tried to impose my political views on her or any of the other students during our classroom discussions. While I took that as a compliment, I told her that my job as a professor is not to indoctrinate students with my political views but to show her and her classmates how both political sides might approach an issue and let them decide for themselves which path or decision was best.\n\nSadly, she noted that many of her professors did just the opposite and that many classroom discussions were one-sided\u2014if the conservative viewpoint was brought up at all. Often, conservative positions were articulated as being \u201cwrong\u201d by her professors. This is a rot that must be rooted out if liberal arts institutions are to fulfill their mission to present a wide variety of viewpoints and perspectives.\n\nA similar ideological fog greeted me upon my arrival to the Kennedy School for my resident fellowship in 2011. Again, the students were very welcoming and interested in my diverse, conservative viewpoints\u2014I met several faculty members at Harvard who were not welcoming. My best memories from Harvard were of exchanges with my students who had never been exposed to conservative viewpoints at great length. There was a respectful dialogue in which we engaged\u2014something many of the faculty members across the nation, as well as at Harvard, seem unable or unwilling to do. Is it any wonder why our college students today have become increasingly intolerant when their faculty role models encourage such a line of thinking?\n\nWhile I don\u2019t agree with Mayor Bloomberg on much of anything, I will say his call for tolerance in academia was equally applicable in his subsequent advice, also in his Harvard commencement remarks, to fix the partisan rancor that has rendered Congress largely inoperable. Here Bloomberg offered: \u201cBut in politics\u2014as it is on too many college campuses\u2014people don\u2019t listen to facts that run counter to their ideology. They fear them.\u201d Turning to the fierce ideological debate surrounding global climate change, Bloomberg continued:\n\nBut there is a world of difference between scientific skepticism that seeks out more evidence and ideological stubbornness that shuts it out. Given the general attitude of many elected officials toward science it\u2019s no wonder that the federal government has abdicated its responsibility to invest in scientific research, much of which occurs at our universities.\n\nThis is where I wish Bloomberg and many on the left would follow his own words of tolerance and inclusiveness as it relates to the science behind climate change. There have been credible reports that the planet has cooled for much of the past two decades, not warmed. There have been allegations that data have been manipulated to fit a political narrative rather than being based on sound science.\n\nYet, for those who question the validity of climate change in the political arena, debates by defenders are often marked by personal attacks that are not based on science but ideology. Again, the same attempt to silence those with differing views on college campuses has become all too prevalent in many of our political discussions in Washington, D.C. today. Rather than tell me how wrong I am to disagree with Bloomberg and the political left on climate change, let\u2019s have a respectful debate so I can further understand your perspective.\n\nWell done, Mayor Bloomberg. I believe your commencement remarks last weekend were a constructive step forward to increasing political tolerance in academia and our political discourse. Let\u2019s hope his inclusive message is heeded rather than ignored.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:18.016+0000"}

In a May 2011 speech, President Obama pledged to elevate the promotion of democracy and human rights to key pillars of America\u2019s foreign policy, insisting they would not be treated as secondary interests.\n\nObama aides bristle at claims that the administration has been decreasing funding for democracy and governance promotion and support.\n\nSpeaking in Poland last week during a European visit, President Obama once again pledged to support democracy movements around the world. In a passionate speech he promised, \u201cWherever people are willing to do the hard work of building democracy\u2014from Tbilisi to Tunis, from Rangoon to Freetown\u2014they will have a partner.\u201d\n\nDemocracy-promotion advocates say there is an increasing disconnect between the rhetoric and practice. They acknowledge Obama has a difficult task\u2014especially when it comes to the post-Arab Spring Middle East\u2014in trying to balance U.S. strategic and national security interests with promotion of democracy and human rights advocacy, and that political setbacks in the region have not helped.\n\nBut American democracy campaigners say the United States has national interest stakes too in combating autocrats and that the White House is not getting the balance right between realpolitik and democracy and human-rights promotion. Overseas there has been criticism, too. At a state banquet in Warsaw to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Poland\u2019s first partially free elections, Lech Walesa, whose Solidarity labor movement helped bring down the Iron Curtain, urged Obama to be more forward-leaning.\n\n\u201cI said that I wished the United States would lead,\u201d Walesa told Polish television.\n\nObama aides and State Department officials dismiss the criticism\u2014they also bristle at claims that the administration has been decreasing funding for democracy and governance promotion and support. Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, claims democracy transitions in Indonesia and Tunisia as Obama successes. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a democracy a central part of our approach in every region that we operate,\u201d he told The Washington Post.\n\nThe dropping of the legislative provision instructing the Secretary of State not to seek prior host government approval when funding civil society groups in their countries isn\u2019t helping the administration make its case that democracy is a fundamental aim of Obama foreign policy.\n\nThe provision the administration is proposing to remove from the foreign appropriations bill is called the \u201cBrownback Amendment.\u201d Named after GOP Senator Sam Brownback, now the governor of Kansas, the amendment was first passed in 2005 and was attached initially to funding for democracy and governance activities in Egypt, allowing the Bush administration to provide aid directly to civil society organizations regardless of whether the Egyptian government approved or whether the organizations were registered as NGOs.\n\nEvery year since 2009, Brownback language has been included in FY budget and appropriation requests with the provision stating that when providing \u201cassistance for democracy, human rights, and governance activities, the organizations implementing such assistance and the specific nature of that assistance shall not be subject to the prior approval of the government of any foreign country.\u201d\n\nAsked why the Brownback Amendment was being omitted from the foreign appropriations request for the first time since 2009, a State Department spokesperson said: \u201cThe administration\u2019s requests frequently recommend that Congress remove restrictions and requirements that constrain flexibility to manage foreign policy, are overly burdensome, and/or are unnecessary due to policy or procedures already in place.\u201d\n\nThe proposed omission coincides with an increasing tendency of the State Department and USAID in their calls for aid proposals from civil society groups for applications to come only from registered U.S. or foreign nonprofit organizations. \u201cThis may not be breaking the Brownback Amendment, but it goes against its spirit,\u201d complains Bockenfeld.\n\nForeign governments insist often that local recipients of U.S. aid must be legally registered but they control the registration process and frequently block from registration civil society organizations or activist groups they disapprove of.

But merit aside, you can indict a ham sandwich if it's Republican in the most liberal hotbed of Texas: Travis County. The problem for Perry is that a Travis County jury can also find a Republican ham sandwich guilty.\n\nJust when Perry was getting a second wind on his presidential aspirations, and getting very good reviews, along comes a grand jury to knock his legs out from under him by charging him with felony counts of abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public servant.\n\nIn April 2013, Travis County's District Attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg was arrested for and pleaded guilty to driving while drunk.

{"entityId": 1627, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Bobby Jindal isn\u2019t stupid enough to believe in Muslim no-go zones. He\u2019s working the base, which is more than willing to be worked.\n\nNow that Republicans realize that the fight over gay marriage is over, they\u2019re pivoting back to the old reliable: Muslims. It\u2019s true that Muslim-bashing among Republicans is hardly new, but I think that as 2016 approaches we\u2019re going to see even more of it as candidates try to outflank one another.\n\nThe latest example was LouisianaGovernor\u2019s Bobby Jindal\u2019s speech on Monday in London. Jindal told the audience that there are \u201cno-go zones\u201d in Europe where Muslims have in essence carved out Islamic \u201cautonomous\u201d zones that are ruled by Koranic law and where non-Muslims fear to tread. His point, of course, was to warn Americans that Muslims could try the same thing in the United States.\n\nNow if that concept sounds familiar it\u2019s because last week Fox News served up this same rancid red meat to its viewers. Some Fox News anchors claimed these so-called \u201cno-go zones\u201d existed in parts of France. And Fox News\u2019 terrorism \u201cexpert\u201d Steve Emerson even went as far as to say that Birmingham, England, the nation\u2019s second biggest city with more than one million people, was a \u201ctotally Muslim city where non-Muslims don\u2019t go in.\u201d\n\nThe backlash to these comments was swift. Even British Prime Minster David Cameron responded, \u201cWhen I heard this, frankly, I choked on my porridge and I thought it must be April Fools Day. This guy is clearly a complete idiot.\u201d\n\nFox News stirring up fear of Muslims is nothing new. In fact, in my view it\u2019s part of Fox\u2019s business model since its viewers hold the most negative views of Muslims of any cable news audience. Fox is simply giving their viewers what they want to see.\n\nBut a few days ago, Fox did something truly shocking. They apologized for making the claims about Muslim-controlled \u201cno-go zones\u201d in Europe. In fact, they apologized not once, but four times, and admitted unequivocally that these \u201cno-go zones\u201d don\u2019t even exist.\n\nYet even though the Fox retractions occurred days before Jindal delivered his speech, that didn\u2019t stop him from asserting the same baseless claims. After his speech, Jindal was asked by a CNN reporter for specifics on where exactly these \u201cno-go zones \u201care located. Jindal, in what looked almost like a sketch from Saturday Night Live, hemmed and hawed, finally responding: \u201cI think your viewers know.\u201d\n\nSo what do you do if you are a Republican candidate seeking conservative votes? Simple. Bash Muslims. We are truly an easy target.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Jindal, he\u2019s no Louie Gohmert. He\u2019s an Ivy League graduate and a Rhodes scholar. Jindal\u2019s remarks were not a mistake, but rather part of a calculated strategy to garner support from more conservative Republicans for an expected2016 presidential run.\n\nNow, in the past, candidates trying to garner support from these right wing voters could use opposition to gay marriage to curry favor. As conservative James Kirchick noted in an article he penned for The Wall Street Journal in 2008, the Republican Party has a long history of its candidates using not just opposition to gay marriage, but also anti-gay rhetoric to attract support from the GOP Base. Kirchick went on to urge Republicans to \u201ckiss gay-bashing goodbye.\u201d\n\nBut we still saw this bigotry in the 2012 race. For example, Rick Perry ran a campaign commercial that said you know \u201cthere\u2019s something wrong with this country when gays can openly serve in the military.\u201d\n\nPolls, however, now show a majority of Americans support gay marriage. And even the Mike Huckabees of the GOP would have to admit that after the Supreme Court announced Friday that it is considering the constitutionality of same-sex marriage this term, gay marriage will likely soon be the law of the land. Bottom line: gay marriage will probably be dead as an issue capable of rallying conservative voters.\n\nSo what do you do if you are a Republican candidate seeking conservative votes? Simple. Bash Muslims. We are truly an easy target. First, Muslims are a small percentage of our nation\u2019s population at approximately 1 to 2 percent. Second, there are horrible Muslims who do commit terror in the name of our faith, which does offer cover for anti-Muslim bigotry. Third, we still don\u2019t have many allies outside of our community that stand with us.\n\nSure, we have some interfaith supporters. But when ant-gay comments are made, like in the case of \u201cDuck Dynasty\u2019s\u201d Phil Roberson in 2013, the response by the left was swift and united. But with anti-Muslim bigotry, we don\u2019t see that. We see silence from many on the left, including from most Democratic elected officials. And worse, we see some outright anti-Muslim fear mongering by so-called liberals like Bill Maher.\n\nIf I\u2019m right, what can we expect to see as the 2016 presidential race heats up? More speeches like Jindal\u2019s designed to stir up fear with no factual support.

Yelp reviewers say it\u2019s \u201cVery, very average and dated,\u201d and \u201cThere was a USED DIRTY UNDERSHIRT on the bed when we walked into the room.\u201d The rate for a room this evening is $137. Liberty, of course, is priceless.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement was a long time in the making.\n\nThe junior senator from Kentucky has been unsubtly campaigning for the Republican nomination for the better part of the last year. He has toured the country giving speeches, raising money, and waging war on Hillary Clinton and potential GOP rivals. He has, put simply, done everything short of say, \u201cI\u2019m running for president.\u201d\n\nPaul is, he would very much like you to know, different from other politicians. He is decidedly not slick: He speaks quietly and slowly, and often sounds as though he is in the middle of trying to figure out what he thinks of something while answering a question. He is not a natural when it comes to retail politics. At events, like a foreign policy speech in New York in the fall, he can be seen sitting, with his legs outstretched and his eyes glued to the table below him, half-heartedly picking at a piece of pie.\n\nHis voice seems to grow hoarse quickly from public speaking and making small talk with voters. All of which communicates the message that Paul really isn\u2019t in this game because he\u2019s good at bullshitting and backslapping.\n\nNot that he\u2019s been in the game for very long. Paul has only been in politics for five years. He entered the Senate in 2010 after getting elected on the strength of the support of his father, libertarian icon Ron Paul (who will, The New York Times\u2019 Jeremy Peters reported, be in attendance Tuesday).\n\nBefore that, Rand Paul was an eye doctor who sometimes dabbled in anti-tax activism and volunteered on his dad\u2019s campaigns.\n\nBut like many kids, as Rand has come into his own, things have gotten complicated with his dad.\n\nPaul is now in the often uncomfortable position of having to appease his father\u2019s libertarian-leaning supporters while moving enough toward the center not to scare off Republican primary voters.\n\nPaul is now in the often uncomfortable position of having to appease his father\u2019s libertarian-leaning supporters while moving enough toward the center to not scare off Republican primary voters.\n\nIt\u2019s a delicate dance, and he has already stumbled while trying to navigate on issues of foreign policy, specifically how to address the rise of ISIS (bomb them in Iraq and Syria, he decided, but formally declare war).\n\nBut Paul\u2019s subtle shift toward a more hawkish foreign policy has not endeared him to authentic interventionists, who regard him as an isolationist nut like his father. They oppose him so fervently that, Bloomberg View\u2019s Josh Rogin reported Monday, one group\u2014the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America\u2014is launching a million-dollar ad campaign against him on Tuesday.\n\nBut that\u2019s an issue for a different day.\n\nOn Monday, Paul was sitting in an SUV with his family, taking the two-hour, 116-mile drive from his hometown of Bowling Green to the Galt House.\n\nHis staff, meanwhile, was roaming the halls of the Galt House. There was Doug Stafford, Paul\u2019s main political adviser, who arrived here on Easter with his family. Holding an iced coffee on the third floor was Elise Jordan, a former speechwriter for Condoleezza Rice who, for the last few months, has served as an informal communications and foreign policy adviser for Paul and will be given a prominent communications position on the campaign.\n\nOnce Paul arrived here in Louisville, he was to attend dinner and a party in his honor and finally, end the night at Patrick O\u2019Shea\u2019s, an Irish pub a short walk from the hotel, where he planned to watch the NCAA championship game with the rest of his staff and members of the media.\n\nAn estimated 1,000 people are expected to show up to the Galt House ballroom to hear Paul\u2019s speech on Tuesday. Paul will, a source with knowledge of the event told me, be introduced first by a video highlighting his record as an ophthalmologist, then by a Kentucky doctor, and finally by his wife, Kelley Paul.\n\nPaul will walk out onstage to a song he has chosen from a list of about 10 rock songs by artists like Metallica and AC/DC (Paul\u2019s campaign has a deal with ASCAP and BMI.)\n\nThe source told me Paul will touch on all the obvious notes: debt (bad), tax cuts (good), peace through strength (also good), standing up to terrorists (great), nation building (bad). The source said the speech will focus on the big picture, and Paul will not make any specific policy proposals.\n\nIn an effort to hype Tuesday\u2019s event, Paul released a 2:43 video collage, titled \u201cDefeat the Washington machine/Unleash American Dream,\u201d on Sunday evening, consisting mostly of cable pundits talking about how \u201cinteresting\u201d he is, set to vaguely movie trailer-reminiscent rock music\u2014a preview, of sorts, of what fans can expect Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for a new way,\u201d he says in the clip. \u201c A new set of ideas.

{"entityId": 1629, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "We cherish our freedoms? Value our privacy? Sort of. But the polls show we value our safety. So most of us don\u2019t mind being lied to.\n\nHeadlines abound touting the new curbs to our government\u2019s domestic spying program signed into law Tuesday by Presidents Obama. We see it described as \u201clandmark legislation ending the government\u2019s bulk telephone data dragnet\u201d and as a \u201clegislative overhaul\u201d to end the government\u2019s \u201ccollection of private telephone records.\u201d\n\nThis new law, known as the USA Freedom Act, purportedly provides that our government will stop collecting wholesale data on our phone calls. But let me ask you something: Do you actually believe our intelligence agencies will stop spying on us? Seriously, deep down, do you think our government will actually end this program that it claims has been keeping us safe?\n\nI doubt many of you do. Our overall trust in the government is all but gone. Indeed, a poll released a few months ago found Americans\u2019 trust in our government to do the \u201cright thing\u201d is at 13 percent, which is the lowest level in the 55 years of measuring that issue, even lower than in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal.\n\nAnd how can we be expected to trust the government especially on the issue of domestic spying given its recent track record?! After all, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lied under oath about the NSA surveillance programs to Congress in 2013? For those who may have forgotten, on March 12, 2013, Clapper appeared before the U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence where this exchange took place between Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Clapper:\n\nWyden: \u201cDoes the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions, or hundreds of millions of Americans?\u201d\n\nClapper: \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\nWyden: \u201cIt does not?\u201d\n\nClapper: \u201cNot wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.\u201d\n\nA few months later Edward Snowden leaked documents showing that the NSA had been collecting massive amounts of metadata from phone companies about calls made by U.S. citizens. After this discourse, Clapper first defended his original answer to Congress but then ultimately admitted that his response was \u201cerroneous.\u201d\n\nNow if Clapper had been fired and indicted for perjury, at least then it would have given us the sense that the government valued being honest with us. Instead Clapper still serves as the director of national intelligence while Snowden remains in Russia, in essence a fugitive.\n\nSo how is it that privacy can be so important to so many yet we see a solid majority contradict that by supporting the government\u2019s spying program? The answer is fear.\n\nSo, no, we don\u2019t trust the government. But do we care if the government invades our privacy as long as it keeps us safe? Obviously some people, including myself, care a great deal about it. Our nation\u2019s Founding Fathers enshrined a right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment. It is truly one of the bedrock principles our nation was founded upon, namely that we have a \u201cright\u201d to be secure in our \u201cpersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\u201d by the government. And that \u201cshall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.\u201d\n\nBut a CNN poll released Monday found that 61 percent of Americans, including majorities of both Democrats and Republicans, support the NSA\u2019s domestic surveillance program. So does this mean that most Americans truly do not care about privacy?\n\nWell, it\u2019s not that simple. Other polls show that when questions concerning privacy are asked, Americans overwhelmingly support the principle of not having others snoop into our lives. In fact, a Pew poll released just two weeks ago found that 74 percent of Americans think it is \u201cvery important\u201d to be \u201cin control of who can get info about you.\u201d\n\nSo how is it that privacy can be so important to so many yet we see a solid majority contradict that by supporting the government\u2019s spying program? The answer is fear. When we are afraid, we are willing to give up freedoms for that. And we have been a scared people since 9/11.\n\nAs Rand Paul, a person who I don\u2019t agree with often, stated Monday on Laura Ingraham\u2019s radio show (a person with whom I never agree) when asked about why some support a loss of liberty: \u201cOften we use fear, and we say, \u2018We won\u2019t be able to catch terrorists.\u2019\u201d\n\nPaul then asked how much of our civil liberties are we prepared to lose, \u201cSo should we put television monitors in every house to try to prevent terrorist attacks?\u201d Paul added, \u201cThere is a zero-sum game here that leads us down a slippery slope to where there would be no freedom left.\u201d\n\nPaul is right. With the advances in technology, who knows how the government will be able to monitor us in the future? Perhaps via our TV monitors, as Paul suggests, or things we can\u2019t even imagine at this time.\n\nI don\u2019t think most Americans truly want a loss of liberties or the \u201cfreedoms\u201d that the neocons claimed Bin Laden wanted to take from us. But they do want to be safe.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just best to let the government lie to us like Clapper did. I\u2019m sure some view Clapper\u2019s lie as not being sinister in intent but more akin to a \u201cgood lie\u201d in the sense of Mark Twain\u2019s Huckleberry Finn, when Huck lied to save the life of his black friend Jim.\n\nSo what do we want: honesty and less security, or lies and safety? If I had to bet, I think most would be cool with believing the lie.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:19.338+0000"}
{"entityId": 1630, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "For a second there, diehard conservatives thought the Texas governor was something of a badass. Now they\u2019re pissed about his new aides.\n\nWhen Texas Gov. Rick Perry was indicted last month on two felony charges stemming from how he dealt with a misbehaving Democratic state official, the image of the stuttering 2012 Republican primary challenger was replaced with that of a hero-cowboy in the eyes of many conservatives. Perry was under attack from the left wing, and his response was not to apologize but to walk through a hail of blue-hued bullets and emerge laughing, without a mark on him. But some conservative true believers have begun to notice something rather suspicious: The company Perry keeps seems more suited to a mainstream Republican\u2014or a right-of-center Democrat\u2014than to their hero-cowboy.\n\nPerry is associated with three operatives who have concerned some members of the die-hard right wing: lobbyist Henry Barbour, former Bill Clinton aide Mark Fabiani, and McCain-Palin campaign chief and MSNBC pundit Steve Schmidt.\n\nWell, maybe \u201cconcerned\u201d is putting it somewhat mildly.\n\n\u201cThe only two options are that Rick Perry is a complete imbecile and he has no idea who these people are and what they\u2019ve done and how the conservative base\u2014who votes in primaries\u2014feels about these guys, or he\u2019s doing it on purpose because that\u2019s the kind of message he wants to send,\u201d said Keli Carender, the national grassroots coordinator for the Tea Party Patriots. Either way, she assured: \u201cIt will be an issue. We will make it an issue.\u201d\n\nBarbour is already working on Perry\u2019s 2016 bid for the White House. But conservatives know him best for his role running the political action committee Mississippi Conservatives, founded by his uncle, Haley Barbour, the former governor of Mississippi. In this year\u2019s Magnolia State primary fight\u2014and \u201cfight\u201d is an understatement\u2014between U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran and state Sen. Chris McDaniel, Barbour reportedly played an influential and controversial role. According to National Review, his PAC funneled money to produce ads against McDaniel that alleged he would set back \u201crace relationships between blacks and whites and other ethnic groups.\u201d The ads, which seemed intended to drive African-American voters to the polls, enraged McDaniel\u2019s Tea Party supporters.\n\nAs reported by Breitbart News, some conservatives loathe Barbour so much that they tried to get the Republican National Committee to censure him, to no avail.\n\n\u201cRepublicans should not hire Henry Barbour unless and until he apologizes for the tactics he helped fund in Mississippi...I don\u2019t think [keeping Barbour around] necessarily means Perry is endorsing what he did, but it means he\u2019s certainly not properly condemning it or taking it seriously enough,\u201d Quin Hillyer, a conservative writer and activist, told The Daily Beast. \u201cWhat he helped finance was so far beyond the pale that he should be blackballed by conservatives, and if Perry wants to be considered a conservative, he should no longer employ Henry Barbour.\u201d\n\nRick Shaftan, a Republican consultant who involved himself in the Mississippi primary, offered a somewhat different view of Barbour to The Daily Beast: \u201cI don\u2019t like what he did in Mississippi, but you know what? It shows he\u2019s a ruthless, cutthroat operative, and there\u2019s something to be said for that on the Republican side. Because we don\u2019t have enough of them. If the force of evil can be brought to do good, then that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only two options are that Rick Perry is a complete imbecile \u2026 or he's doing it on purpose because that's the kind of message he wants to send.\u201d\n\nNormally, staffers don\u2019t matter much to voters, Carender noted. But Mississippi is different for many on the far right. It\u2019s become the ultimate test of Tea Party fidelity, a measuring stick for whether a conservative will sell out his principles to inside-the-Beltway Washington RINOs or will stay true to the cause and the grassroots activists who are the heart and soul of the movement.\n\nPeople don\u2019t recognize, Carender said, just \u201chow plugged in the conservative base is to Mississippi\u2026If you\u2019re a man of integrity, you don\u2019t associate with Henry Barbour as far as we\u2019re concerned.\u201d\n\nPerry has associated with Barbour since at least 2012, when Barbour served on his ill-fated but memorable presidential campaign. (Haley Barbour, for his part, supported Newt Gingrich.)\n\nPublicly, Perry may have shrugged at last month\u2019s indictment\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean he hasn\u2019t been taking Lone Star State-size measures to ensure it doesn\u2019t sink him for good.\n\nAs part of his legal team, Perry has hired the Harvard-educated Mark Fabiani, best known for his ties to the Democratic Party. From 1994 through 1996, Fabiani worked as special counsel to President Bill Clinton. He then served as Al Gore\u2019s communications director during his 2000 presidential campaign. Fabiani has worked for the Democratic former San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom as well.\n\nPerry also has hired Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist and former consultant to John McCain in 2008. Schmidt has long enraged Tea Party conservatives with his candor about members of his own party. Schmidt has called McCain\u2019s VP pick, Sarah Palin, \u201csomeone [who] was nominated to the vice presidency who was manifestly unprepared to take the oath of office should it become necessary and as it has become necessary many times in American history.\u201d Asked whether Palin would have a future in politics, Schmidt once remarked: \u201cI hope not...And the reason I say that is because if you look at it, over the last four years, all of the deficiencies in knowledge, all of the deficiencies in preparedness, she\u2019s done not one thing to rectify them, to correct them.\u201d\n\nThen Schmidt described Palin\u2019s unflattering qualities, which could, unfortunately for Perry, double as descriptions for most members of the Tea Party: \u201cShe has become a person who, I think, is filled with grievance, filled with anger, who has a divisive message for the national stage...\u201d\n\nConservative radio host Mark Levin wondered of Schmidt, \u201cWhy would Perry hire this conservative attacker and Palin hater?\u201d\n\nSchmidt made those comments on MSNBC, where he is employed as a political analyst. Shaftan said of Perry hiring the strategist: \u201cIf they have Steve Schmidt working for them, why are they telling people? That I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nPerry has been basking in the glory of the conservative credibility his fight with Texas Democrats has lent him\u2014so much so that his mugshot features a prominent smirk, one you can wear on a T-shirt being sold by his PAC for just $25. Some Republicans made that same image their Facebook profile pictures in a show of support, in the way some do for gay marriage, or to end violence against children. But you\u2019re only as good as the company you keep, according to some members of the far right who have in the past proved themselves to be loud enough to get their way.\n\nConservative HQ columnist Richard Viguerie wrote of Perry\u2019s team: \u201cWhen you hire a consultant, you hire his reputation, strategy, and tactics. We doubt that Governor Perry plans to win the Republican presidential nomination by race-baiting, recruiting Democrats to vote in Republican primary elections, and trashing as \u2018poisonous\u2019 conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh\u2026\u201d\n\nHillyer agreed: \u201cA very important law of politics and government, as emphasized again and again by conservative movement leader Morton Blackwell, is that personnel is policy. If somebody wants to get a sense of how a political leader might govern, it certainly is important to see who he hires.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:20.144+0000"}

But until we find a way to get money out of politics, they\u2019re all stillborn.\n\nAs the presidential primaries begin to heat up, the candidates, especially the second- and third-tier challengers to the early favorites, are pressing ever more bold ideas into the debate. Martin O\u2019Malley won the prize last week with the most ambitious Wall Street reform proposal in the campaign so far. And before O\u2019Malley, Bernie Sanders had even revived the idea of a \u201csingle payer\u201d health care system for all.\n\nRepublicans are doing the same on the right. Rand Paul has proposed \u201cblowing up\u201d the tax code, and replacing it with a single 14.5 percent rate on individuals and businesses. Three other Republicans have also jumped on the flat-tax bandwagon.\n\nThis is the stuff presidential campaigns are made for: bold ideas to capture a committed base, and launch candidates into nominations.\n\nBut to listen to these ideas requires a certain suspension of disbelief. Because putting aside the problem of divided government, none of these ideas has even a shot in Washington until we address the corrupting influence of money in politics.\n\nConsider O\u2019Malley\u2019s reform of Wall Street. The finance sector gives more to congressional campaigns than any other sector of the American economy. It spends more through super PACs than any other sector as well. And as the last eight years have taught Democrats, it spends its money strategically.\n\nIn 2008, 51 percent of finance\u2019s money went to Democrats. In 2010, that fell to 47 percent. The Democrats then enacted Dodd-Frank. Finance responded: In 2012, Democrats received 32 percent of finance\u2019s contributions. In 2014, it received 37 percent. That number is certain to fall if 2016 is a rally against Wall Street. Can the Democrats as a party afford a committed Wall Street reformer for president\u2014 at least so long as they depend on Wall Street\u2019s cash to stay competitive?\n\nThe same is true for Republicans and tax reform. The tax system is a complicated mess for many reasons. But one reason is the way it helps Congress finance its campaigns.\n\nThink about the R&D tax credit, which has been a \u201ctemporary\u201d provision in the tax code since 1981. Each time the credit is about to expire, Congress rallies support to renew the tax break from those who benefit from it. \u201cSupport\u201d means campaign contributions. As the libertarian Institute for Policy Innovation puts it, \u201cthis cycle has repeated itself for years ... Congress essentially uses this cycle to raise money for re-election, promising the industry more predictability the next time around.\u201d\n\nPractically every single important issue in Washington is now held hostage to big money, from climate change to addressing the debt.\n\nThese are not isolated examples. Practically every single important issue in Washington is now held hostage to big money, from climate change to addressing the debt. And amazingly, candidates from both parties are beginning to acknowledge this. Republicans like Lindsey Graham are openly criticizing Citizens United. And O\u2019Malley and Sanders have both endorsed fundamental changes to the way campaigns are funded\u2014at least, as Sanders said in his announcement, \u201cin the long run.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the long run\u201d? What does Sanders believe he will get done in the short run, while Congress remains dependent on campaign cash from the very entities his reforms would dramatically affect? We live in a constitutional republic. Fundamental policy change requires Congress. But without a Congress that can act, sensibly, talk of revolution is just that.\n\nNone of these bold ideas for reform, from either Republicans or Democrats, are credible until they include a plan for liberating Congress from its corrupting dependence. Yet not a single candidate for president has offered a plan for that liberation. Almost every serious candidate acknowledges the problem. Yet none has come close to a plausible way to address it.\n\nIf these reformers are to be taken seriously, they need to give us a plan. They need to show us how they will deliver a Congress, as former governor and Republican presidential candidate Buddy Romer put it, \u201cfree to lead\u201d\u2014first. They need to identify the steps they will take immediately upon coming to office that would free Congress from special-interest money. They need to convince us those steps are plausible, and give us a reason to believe they can succeed.\n\nBecause if they can\u2019t, maybe we shouldn\u2019t be looking for another Superman or Superwoman for president. Maybe we should be looking for a leader who could make the most of a broken democracy. President Obama has done an amazing job over the past five years with a Congress that cannot function. If the reformers want us to believe they would be a president who could do more, they need to tell us how.

{"entityId": 1632, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Obama administration concluded in 2012 that al Qaeda posed no direct threat to the U.S.\u2014and has sought to scale back the fight ever since, over intel officials\u2019 rising objections.\n\nIn 2012, the Obama administration produced a draft National Intelligence Estimate that reached a surprising conclusion: al Qaeda was no longer a direct threat to America. That classified assessment, which has never before been publicly disclosed, was in keeping with the message coming from the White House. President Obama rode to re-election in 2012 partly on the success of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. At rallies and in press conferences, the president and top officials publicly said al Qaeda was on the run.\n\n\n\nBut some senior U.S. intelligence officials, like Defense Intelligence Agency Director Gen. Michael Flynn, fought hard against that assessment, which amounted to an official pronouncement of the American intelligence community\u2019s collected wisdom. Flynn and his faction won a partial victory, striking the judgment that the terrorist group no longer posed a threat to the homeland. \u201cFlynn and others at the time made it clear they would not go along with that kind of assessment,\u201d one U.S. intelligence officer who worked on the al Qaeda file told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt was basically: \u2018Over my dead body.\u2019\u201d\n\nSince that internal clash\u2014and since Obama said in his 2012 State of the Union that \u201cal Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can\u2019t escape the reach of the United States of America\u201d\u2014the terror group has thrived throughout the Islamic world. In the last year alone, al Qaeda has established safe havens in Libya, Syria and Iraq.\n\nAnd so naturally, the White House has softened its earlier position, concluding that al Qaeda and its affiliates still represented a serious threat. But the tension between the White House and many top military and intelligence officials fighting the long war remain.\n\nIn interviews with many of them, a common theme is sounded: The threat from al Qaeda is rising, but the White House is looking to ratchet down the war against these Islamic extremists. As a result, intelligence gathered on these threats remain shrouded from the public and, in many cases, from senior government officials. And now Congress and the White House are beginning to consider modifying\u2014and possibly revoking\u2014the very authority to find, fix and finish those terrorists who pose the threat today.\n\nOne senior U.S. intelligence official told The Daily Beast the frustration was that there is pressure from the White House to downplay the threat from some al Qaeda affiliates. \u201cIt comes from the top, it\u2019s the message that al Qaeda is all these small franchise groups and they are not coordinated and threatening,\u201d this official said. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole idea of getting us out to place resources against something that they don\u2019t think is a problem. It\u2019s not their war, it\u2019s not our conflict.\u201d\n\nThe White House, naturally, has a different position. Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, in a lengthy email to The Daily Beast outlining White House counter-terrorism policies, said, \u201cAs the President has emphasized, we must define our effort not as a boundless \u2018global war on terror\u2019 \u2013 but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat specific networks of violent extremists that threaten the United States.\u201d\n\nAnd, of course, it should be noted that the U.S. intelligence community still spends an enormous amount of money on counter-terrorism: $17.2 billion in 2013 alone, according to budget documents published by The Washington Post. But that money, after years of unchecked expansion, has leveled off as the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies have begun to steer resources towards cyber security and other issues.\n\nThis week, this internal struggle over the response to al Qaeda is reaching a crucial moment. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday will hold a nearly unprecedented hearing on the 2001 law that authorizes a long, global war against al Qaeda and its allies.\n\nAt the same time, U.S. intelligence officers say, there is deep division within their ranks\u2013and with the White House\u2014about the strength of al Qaeda in the place where that war began: Afghanistan. The current estimate of the terror group\u2019s presence there says that al Qaeda has a little more than 100 fighters in the country\u2019s province of Kunar. That, these intelligence officers contend, is wildly out of date. \u201cAl Qaeda has a presence all over Afghanistan today,\u201d a senior U.S. intelligence official told The Daily Beast. \u201cThis is the conversation that no one wants to have. What are they going to do after 2014 when most of our troops will be gone?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt comes from the top, it\u2019s the message that al Qaeda is all these small franchise groups and they are not coordinated and threatening. It\u2019s not their war, it\u2019s not our conflict.\u201d\n\nThe frustration isn\u2019t limited to Afghanistan. One of the reasons the 2012 Benghazi attacks still rankle a sizeable segment of the intelligence community is that they see a similar downplaying of the extremist threat in the initial reaction to the strikes. U.S. intelligence officers in Libya on the night of the attacks cabled back that it was a coordinated terrorist attack, only to see Obama administration officials cling to out-of-date talking points that described it as a demonstration gone awry. The Daily Beast has learned that one reason why CIA officers were so quick to conclude the attack was an act of terrorism was because some of the fighters who participated in the attack were being watched by CIA officers at the time on the ground in Libya, according to U.S. intelligence officials and congressional investigators.\n\nMany U.S. al Qaeda experts inside the intelligence community are also critical of the handling of the documents taken from Osama bin Laden\u2019s Pakistani lair. These experts lobbied to declassify many more than the handful that have thus far been released. Some of those documents that were initially slated to be declassified, according to two U.S. intelligence officials, were letters between leaders of Boko Haram and bin Laden. In other words, they showed that the Nigerian terror group, now infamous for its mass kidnappings, was tied to al Qaeda\u2019s leader. Those records are still being kept under wraps. Rep. Devin Nunes, a Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has openly called on the Obama administration to declassify all of the documents.\n\nIn all of these examples, the common theme of frustration is that while the political will to fight a long war against a less centralized al Qaeda network wanes in America, the threat gathers overseas. \u201cThere is a desire for peace and I understand that. Everyone admits theoretically that the enemy gets a vote. But the war is not over till the enemy says it\u2019s over,\u201d James Mattis, who served as Obama\u2019s commander of Central Command between 2010 and 2013, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThere is some disagreement or reservations about whether people are trying to wish things away on a timetable.\u201d\n\nMattis is not alone in this view. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic chairwoman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, told CNN on Sunday, \u201cTerror is not down in the world. It is up, both deaths, injuries, in many, many different places. Al Qaeda has metastasized. The question becomes how do we prevent an attack in this country.\u201d James Comey, the FBI director, said in an interview with The New York Times that he underestimated the threat from al Qaeda when he came into the job nine months ago.\n\nThese days the rhetoric from the Obama administration about al Qaeda being on the run is largely gone. Publicly and privately Obama has acknowledged that the threat of jihadists has metastasized. In this year\u2019s state of the union Obama expressed the view as: \u201cWhile we have put al Qaeda\u2019s core leadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved, as al Qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world.\u201d But those lines were delivered in a speech that promised to get America off of a \u201cpermanent war footing\u201d and expressing skepticism that the lethal combination of unmanned drones and electronic eavesdropping alone can defeat terrorism.\n\nTommy Vietor, who served as the spokesman for the National Security Council in Obama\u2019s first term, recalled a meeting he attended with Obama on the crisis in Mali. He said the president understood the threat from al Qaeda\u2019s core leadership had diminished, while the threat of affiliates had grown stronger. At the end of the meeting though, he said the president remarked, \u201cWhat will be required for a crisis like that is not a drone-based program dotting the continent. It will be a sustained political process that includes economic development.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an irony for Obama, who has been attacked by progressives for relying too heavily on drone attacks in his war on terrorism. But Vietor and many other U.S. intelligence and military officials also point out the president has had to balance priorities and limited resources. And there are those within the intelligence community who share that view\u2014who worry that an obsessive focus on al Qaeda distracted the United States from other adversaries, like Russia and China.\n\n\u201cI think part of the difference is some of the members of the military and the intelligence community understandably see a matrix in the morning of unbelievable threats. They do everything they can to prevent those threats from materializing and they would like as much resources as they can get to do that,\u201d Vietor told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe president wakes up in the morning, he sees that same matrix, for a long time he also saw a briefing of threats to the world economy that is arguably as scary. And he has to do deal with all of them. That means making tough choices and seeing the whole playing field, not just a day at a time, but a decade at a time.\u201d\n\nObama may have his chance to take America off of a war footing. The hearing Wednesday on the Authorization for the Use of Military Force is being held at the behest of Sen. Bob Corker, the Republican ranking member on the committee who is often positioned between his own parties hawks like Sen. John McCain on foreign policy and war-on-terror skeptics like Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nCorker last year in a hearing on the AUMF said it was difficult to tie the groups targeted by the U.S. military and intelligence community today to the organization that attacked the United States on 9/11. \u201cCongress should amend the law to specify exactly how and when the president can use drones and kill or capture missions to kill people,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nHayden said the White House was open to modifying the AUMF. \u201cWe will engage further with Congress and the American people on efforts to ensure that the legal authorities for our counterterrorism and detention operations are appropriately tailored,\u201d she said.\n\nBut it will be difficult to \u201cappropriately tailor\u201d the authorities and operations that comprise the war on terror if so many of the analysts and officers on the front lines believe the threat from the group is rising.\n\nOr, as one senior U.S. intelligence official told The Daily Beast: \u201cTake this \u2018al Qaeda is on the run\u2019 message, it\u2019s something you\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years. If they are on the run, they are on the run to the United States.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:21.285+0000"}

A long time before you advocate war!\u201d\n\nFive or ten years ago, Rand did, too.\n\nIn 2007, when he was campaigning for his dad\u2019s presidential campaign, Rand was vocally skeptical not just of the idea that the Iranians could obtain a nuclear weapon but also of the notion that if they were to, it would present much of a threat to the United States. \u201cIf you look at it, intellectually look at the evidence\u2026Iran is not a threat,\u201d he told radio host Alex Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to think that they\u2019re a threat to our national security.\u201d\n\nToday, presidential candidate Rand Paul takes a very different position\u2014one completely at odds with his father\u2019s.\n\nIn response to the agreement reached among Iran, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, Russia, and Germany, Paul released a statement calling the deal \u201cunacceptable\u201d because \u201csanctions relief precedes evidence of compliance,\u201d \u201cIran is left with significant nuclear capacity,\u201d and \u201cit lifts the ban on selling advanced weapons to Iran.\u201d\n\nThis is, according to Ron Paul, nonsense.\n\nLast Monday, the elder Paul wrote a column for the Ron Paul Institute that characterized the deal as \u201cone of the two most important achievements of an otherwise pretty dismal Obama presidency.\u201d On Thursday, he explained why he believes those who disagree with him\u2014flesh and blood or not\u2014are dead wrong.\n\nOpponents of diplomacy with Iran, Paul told the crowd, say, \u201cOh, they\u2019re bad people. There\u2019s a bunch of nutty people in Iran, and they say nasty things. Well, if you were in Iran and listened to some of the nasty things our leaders say about them, you probably would understand this a little bit better!\u201d The crowd erupted into applause.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two individuals right now who have sort of caught the attention: Trump and Sanders.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut my practical argument for this is that the founders actually gave us pretty good advice: We should stay out of entangling alliances and mind our own business and trade with people. But in my lifetime, there were certain episodes that I was very glad our government was willing to talk to other governments that were considered evil and monstrous.\u201d\n\nDrafted into the military in 1962, Paul said, \u201cDo you think I complained when Kennedy called up Khrushchev and said, \u2018Hey, maybe there\u2019s a better way? You take your weapons out of Cuba and I\u2019ll take \u2019em out of Turkey,\u2019 and the thing was over. So I would say that diplomatic conversation was very beneficial. So, to say that the Iranians aren\u2019t perfect people and we shouldn\u2019t talk to them? You know, we have been so obsessed, for probably 30 years, on the emergency of a nuclear weapon next week, next month, or next year\u2014on a weapon that doesn\u2019t exist. The Soviets had 30,000 of them, and then they\u2019d come back to us and say that we\u2019re a bunch of kooks for wanting to talk to these bad people? I would say that the advice is that friendship is a wise idea.\u201d\n\nWhen the younger Paul first began testing the waters for a presidential run, in spring 2014, one of his pseudo-campaign\u2019s central priorities, it seemed, was to dispel the notion that he was his father\u2019s clone. The emancipation is now complete, but the effect has been catastrophic for his presidential ambitions. Being a watered-down version of Ron Paul, the evidence suggests, doesn\u2019t make Rand Paul more appealing to other factions of the GOP his dad couldn\u2019t reach\u2014it just makes him less appealing to his natural base of supporters.\n\nNo one can know what goes on within a family, of course. But the elder Paul seemed to be sending a message to his son during his hourlong remarks.\n\nAt another point in the speech, he noted that in the presidential race, \u201cThere\u2019s two individuals right now who have sort of caught the attention: Trump and Sanders.\u201d\n\nHis son, who is polling at 6 percent\u2014behind not just Trump but Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee\u2014did not receive a mention.\n\nUpdate: Doug Stafford, a senior adviser for the campaign, sent me an email taking issue with the \u201cpremise\u201d of this story. He included a statement which does not contradict the premise of this story at all, but I\u2019m including it here nevertheless: \u201cBeing against a bad deal that is the product of bad diplomacy does not make one against diplomacy. In fact, Senator Paul has stated before, during and after these negotiations that he favors diplomacy and negotiations. He still favors them. He would leave the current interim deal in place and keep going as he has said publicly several times. He also believes in negotiating from strength as Reagan did, and believes this administration has failed to do that and came up with a deal that doesn\u2019t work.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:21.557+0000"}
{"entityId": 1634, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "So Obama tees it up for Clinton by focusing on the middle class, and what does the GOP say? Cut entitlements! Can anybody play this game?\n\nLast week was a great week for Hillary Clinton. The State of the Union was essentially 2016 Clinton\u2019s campaign kickoff speech. Its themes of work and responsibility were vintage Clinton\u2014Bill Clinton, anyway. Meanwhile, the Republicans were doing their best to have folks brand them as the party of plutocracy by again calling for \u201centitlement reform,\u201d even as wages stagnate and fewer Americans see themselves as part of the middle class. Has anyone heard of Marie Antoinette?\n\nTopping off the week that was, the latest Washington Post/ABC Poll showed Clinton with a double-digit lead over the leading possible GOP nominees both nationally and in the ever-important Midwest. Even more disturbingly for the GOP, she also leads among white working-class voters outside of the South, and among white non-evangelical Protestants. The distance between where the GOP is and where it must travel to reclaim the White House remains far.\n\nTo be sure, Obama\u2019s State of the Union was a tacit admission that the Democrats\u2019 estrangement from working-class whites has cost his party dearly, much like an alcoholic coming to grips with the reality of his drinking problem. Last November, the bill for catering to the Democrats\u2019 Coalition of the Ascendant finally came due, and its price was hefty. In 2014, little more than one-third of white voters without college degrees voted to send a Democrat to Congress, and the effects of working-class rejection were devastating.\n\nThe Democrats lost control of the Senate, while Republicans picked up 13 House seats, gaining their largest majority since 1928. At the state level, the results were equally grim for the Democrats. Thirty-one states now have Republican governors, with the GOP controlling the largest bloc of state houses since 1926. Illinois, Obama\u2019s home state, ever-blue Massachusetts, and recently (but deeply) blued Maryland now have Republican governors.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s prescription is a recipe for alienating the GOP\u2019s electoral base, which is chock full of retirees and voters north of 50.\n\nSubstantively, the SOTU was a speech that a major part of the country liked, even if it made House Speaker John Boehner and the Republicans cringe. For the Republicans, that\u2019s a problem, especially if the only thing Republicans have to offer the middle class is entitlement reform, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested in the run-up to the State of the Union.\n\nIn a pre-SOTU statement, McConnell beseeched the President to \u201callow us to save and strengthen Medicare,\u201d and to \u201ccooperate with both parties to save Social Security.\u201d In other words, make sure both parties have their hands on the dagger and no one will get blamed.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s prescription is a recipe for alienating the GOP\u2019s electoral base, which is chock full of retirees and voters north of 50. Green eye shades and the worn eraser of an accountant\u2019s pencil don\u2019t win elections, and angry seniors can wreak havoc on presidential aspirations.\n\nIn 2008, grandma and grandpa stayed away from the polls, and the Democrats won going away. With voter self-identification as \u201cmiddle class\u201d shrinking, and with two-fifths of Americans calling themselves \u201clower class,\u201d calls for cuts to Medicare and Social Security are politically self-defeating.\n\nOh, and then there\u2019s also economic reality. Bond yields are low, with the 10-year treasury below 1.8 percent, and 30-year home mortgages going for under 4 percent. Given these numbers, cutting entitlements right here and now will likely bring more pain than benefit\u2014except perhaps to some of Wall Street\u2019s players.\n\nAlmost on cue, Glenn Hubbard, Mitt Romney\u2019s chief economic adviser in 2012, compounded the situation by seconding McConnell\u2019s call for entitlement reform in a post-SOTU New York Times op-ed. For those who forgot, this is the same Hubbard who immediately after Romney\u2019s 2012 defeat wrote, \u201cI have fond memories of summer trips to Perkins Cove in Ogunquit, Maine\u2014for lobster but also for the scenery along Marginal Way, a narrow path along a cliff by the beach.\u201d\n\n\n\nPrecious. The only things missing from Hubbard\u2019s menu were the Grey Poupon and the Dom Perignon. Indeed, as Charles Ferguson, the Oscar winning creator of \u201cInside Job,\u201d the 2010 documentary that examined the financial crisis and Hubbard\u2019s own conflicts of interest, wrote: \u201cStanding behind every great con artist is someone like ... Glenn Hubbard.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs inconvenient as they may be to some Democrats and Republicans, working Americans are taxpaying Americans who have a right to expect something in return for their tax dollar\u2014something other than Obamacare, with its false promises and its disruptions, or cuts to Medicare that have been championed by both this Administration and congressional Republicans. Politics is transactional, and if the donor bases of both parties can get tax breaks, subsidies, and taxpayer-funded windfalls, then Joe and Josephine Six-Pack have something coming to them\u2014especially if they earned it.\n\nRather than gunning for Medicare, the Republicans should pick up on some of threads in Obama\u2019s speech, while taking a hard line against tax hikes. The GOP should bash the President for looking to undercut saving for college and 529 accounts, and also push for a reduction in payroll taxes. The fact is that most Americans pay more in Medicare and Social Security taxes than in income taxes. And if wonks and purists criticize simultaneously sparing benefits while cutting taxes, just point out that being pro-middle class and pro-worker is about rewarding their efforts and lessening their burdens.\n\nRepublicans should seize on the President\u2019s invitation to fund precision medicine to combat cancer and diabetes, and expand that war to fight Alzheimer\u2019s and autism. They should also embrace rebuilding our infrastructure. In addition to new jobs, infrastructure is a cornerstone of commerce. If building a rail system was good enough for Abraham Lincoln, and forging a national highway system was all right with Ike, then the GOP should treat infrastructure as part of its own patrimony.\n\nObama\u2019s sixth State of the Union and rising popularity should be taken as harbingers of what 2016 may bring. Sure, Hillary lacks Bill\u2019s charm, and the polls show her to be divisive, but right now she\u2019s connecting with the public, which is more than can be said of the current Republican field. To be blunt, Hillary Clinton is not Barack Obama, and the middle class knows it.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:21.828+0000"}

Eva Longoria, who has emerged as a genuine player in Democratic politics, was one of the President Obama\u2019s top bundlers for the 2012 election.

If there\u2019s a high-profile Democratic fundraiser in Los Angeles, you\u2019d probably spot them there.\n\nThis election cycle alone, they have sunk tens of thousands of dollars into Democratic war chests, including the campaigns of Ed Markey, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Begich, Alison Lundergan Grimes, Mark Udall, Tom Udall, Kay Hagan, Bruce Braley, and many others.

Bibi and his supporters have framed this as a Churchillian moment; one where the world can never claim it wasn\u2019t warned of the oncoming calamity that is a nuclear-armed Iran. They sell this address as the last best hope to save his besieged country from certain annihilation.\n\nIn reality, the speech is shortsighted political theater, which will do little for Israel\u2019s long-term security, but stands a good chance of rupturing the once-unshakable bond between Israel and its most stalwart ally and benefactor.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner\u2019s invitation to Netanyahu to speak on Capitol Hill, delivered without White House consultation or approval, has been perceived by many Democrats as a partisan insult. Some are refusing to take part in what they see as an attempt by a foreign leader to use Congress as the stage for a campaign speech, while others won\u2019t allow themselves to be party to a GOP effort to undermine the Obama administration during a moment of delicate diplomacy.\n\nNetanyahu insists he must deliver his address to Congress and the American people before the March 31 deadline ending nuclear negotiations between Iran, the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France, and Germany. The speech stands almost no chance of derailing the talks, but might aid his re-election efforts back home, where President Obama is deeply unpopular and where Israelis go to the polls on March 17.\n\nWould Netanyahu risk his country\u2019s single greatest foreign policy advantage, the total support of both major American political parties, for a pre-election polling bump? As I wrote at Reason.com, congressional support for Israel is one of very few issues where Democrats and Republicans march together in lockstep, including the most iconoclastic members of each party.\n\nAt a Vermont town hall meeting, Congress\u2019s most left-wing member, socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), shouted down his own constituents who were furious over mounting civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip during last summer\u2019s war between Israel and Hamas. On the right, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) backtracked on his earlier call to cut support for Israel (and everyone else) to make the absurd assertion that he said no such thing. Paul even went to Israel and took a mud bath in the Dead Sea to prove how much he didn\u2019t say what he said. Showing your Israeli street credibility is a bipartisan survival instinct.\n\nThough every U.S. president since George H.W. Bush has been publicly critical of Israel\u2019s construction of settlements in the occupied West Bank, no president or Congress has cut military aid to Israel by a single dime. Israel can always count on the United States to stand in its corner at the United Nations. When the rubber hits the road, there is simply no daylight between the governments of the U.S. and Israel.\n\nIf the speech goes ahead as planned, it could indeed be a watershed moment, but far removed from what Bibi intends.\n\nThat said, it is no secret that Netanyahu and President Obama have endured an acrimonious six-year relationship. Netanyahu infamously wagged his finger at the president in the Oval Office, an act that almost certainly would have generated GOP outrage if, say, the president of France had done it. Speaking of whom, Obama was caught on a live mic grousing with then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy about how often he has to \u201cdeal with\u201d Netanyahu. There\u2019s no love lost between these two guys, but it hasn\u2019t changed U.S. policy toward Israel in any appreciable way.\n\nThis speech could change that. It has already caused a minor uprising in the Democratic Party, with 23 members of Congress petitioning Boehner to postpone the speech until after Israel\u2019s election. Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) went on record saying he will not attend the speech, telling the Associated Press, \u201cI think it\u2019s an affront to the president and the State Department, what the speaker did.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), flailing to prevent the image of a Democratic boycott of the Israeli prime minister, unconvincingly offered that visiting foreign leaders are a distraction for members of Congress \u201ctrying to pass legislation\u2026meeting with their constituents and the rest.\u201d That\u2019s ridiculous. These kinds of events are what politicians live for. A photo-op with a head of state passes for \u201cforeign policy experience\u201d for many undistinguished members of Congress on the re-election campaign trail. Hedging her bets once more, Pelosi said, \u201cAs of now, it is my intention to go,\u201d but added, \u201cIt is still my hope that the event will not take place.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu is not wrong to consider a nuclear-armed Iran a threat. Iran has long supported Hamas and Hezbollah, two entities Israel has been in a state of war with for decades, both of which exist on or within Israel\u2019s borders. He may very well believe that his speech is a matter of existential importance, and that only this drastic step stands between the U.S.\u2019s appeasement of a nuclear-armed nation-state run by a suicidal death cult, whose president once openly wished for a future where Israel would be \u201cwiped off the map.\u201d\n\nWhich is exactly why Yair Lapid, one of Netanyahu\u2019s former allies turned political rivals, says the speech is a mistake. Lapid told the Jerusalem Post that Netanyahu could have made his case to America \u201cquietly, not poking the United States president in the chest,\u201d and blamed the speech for the loss of bipartisan congressional support for a new bill of sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe agencies entrusted with Israel\u2019s security are even more skeptical of the prime minister. Former Shin Bet chief Yuval Diskin accused Netanyahu of \u201cmisleading the public on the Iran issue\u201d and said that an Israeli attack \u201cwould accelerate the Iranian nuclear race.\u201d Former Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Benny Gantz took aim at Netanyahu\u2019s heated rhetoric, saying, \u201cDecisions can and must be made carefully, out of historic responsibility but without hysteria.\u201d\n\nJust-released documents published by The Guardian reveal that the Mossad secretly contradicted Netanyahu\u2019s past assertions about Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions (PDF). In a presentation before the UN in 2012, Bibi drew a red line near the top of a drawing of a bomb to demonstrate the shrinking time frame for Iran to produce a nuclear weapon. The leaked Mossad files concluded just the opposite, that Iran is \u201cnot performing the activity necessary to produce weapons.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s behavior suggests the desperation of a politician facing the toughest election of his life, and this includes the 1999 election, which ended his first stint as prime minister. Deep down, Bibi knows if he loses this one, there\u2019s no coming back a third time.\n\nBeyond typical domestic legislative battles and never-ending threats of war, Netanyahu is loaded with political liabilities. Dogging the home stretch of his campaign are allegations against his wife, Sara, of drunkenly abusing employees and improperly pocketing recycling deposits from official functions, as well as a recent report from Israel\u2019s State Comptroller suggesting an improper use of state funds, which could lead to a criminal investigation.\n\nWriting for Brookings, Natan Sachs describes the current Israeli political climate as one suffering from \u201cNetanyahu fatigue,\u201d adding, \u201cthe elections have become, to a degree, a referendum on Netanyahu himself.\u201d Netanyahu fatigue could translate to \u201cIsrael fatigue\u201d in the United States, particularly on the left.\n\nNetanyahu is forcing Democrats to choose between their leader, still popular in his own party, and the prime minister of a country whose policies are increasingly falling out of favor with young liberals. Worse for the special relationship between the two nations, many American Jews are taking pointed exception to Netanyahu\u2019s assertion that he speaks as a \u201crepresentative of the entire Jewish people.\u201d\n\nAt The Nation, M.J. Rosenberg writes that Netanyahu\u2019s recklessness has even caused a stir among the lobbyists most responsible for the staunch bipartisan support of Israel, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC):\n\nIn the words of one ex-AIPAC staffer still close to the organization, \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s falling into bed with the Republicans has the people who run AIPAC seeing red, and not just the Democrats. The Republican board members aren\u2019t stupid. They do not want AIPAC viewed as a GOP operation. But, increasingly, that is how AIPAC is viewed. With Netanyahu teaming up with Boehner to embarrass Obama, it is hard to dispute that AIPAC is becoming an organizational version of Sheldon Adelson. Meanwhile, every Jew in Congress except one is not only a Democrat but a liberal Democrat.\u201d\n\nIf the speech goes ahead as planned, it could indeed be a watershed moment, but far removed from what Bibi intends. At a time when American opinions of Israel are changing, alienating half of the elite political class could leave Israel in a most precarious position long after Obama and Netanyahu have left office. Instead of rallying America to its cause, this could be what makes U.S. support of Israel a partisan issue, rather than the rubber stamp it has historically been.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:22.675+0000"}

Sunlight peeked through a window behind him as he addressed a crowd.\n\n\u201cFull house in Nampa, Idaho!\u201d Paul tweeted. An accompanying photo showed fewer than 100 people, seated in gold-rimmed chairs, watching him.\n\n\u201cA lot of times people ask me, \u2018Why did you decide to run for office?\u2019\u201d he began.\n\nIt\u2019s a question he might also be asking himself.\n\nNothing has gone right for Rand Paul in the last few months. His poll numbers have been in rapid decline while interest in his candidacy has waned. So this week, Paul packed up and traveled West to Alaska to try, in the words of a campaign adviser, to visit \u201cplaces other Republicans aren\u2019t going\u201d or more specifically, places overlooked by mainstream candidates but where his father, Ron Paul, performed competitively when he ran for the nomination in 2012.\n\nDonald Trump's ascent has meant that interest in every other candidate has been eclipsed, and all of Paul's efforts to shift the spotlight back onto himself have been unsuccessful. In July, as Trump took off, Paul dressed up like a high-school shop teacher and filmed himself setting the U.S. tax code on fire, mutilating it in a woodchopper, and destroying it with a chainsaw. Nobody seemed to care.\n\nBy the time of the first Republican debate in Cleveland, Paul was polling at around 6 percent. His strategy that night was to get people interested in him again by picking fights, first with Trump, whom Paul accused of being inauthentically conservative, and then with Chris Christie, with whom Paul debated the Patriot Act. It didn\u2019t work.\n\nAt this time last year, Paul was the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination. He\u2019s now polling within the margin of error.\n\nOn Thursday, a new Quinnipiac University poll showed that just 2 percent of Republican or Republican-leaning voters would vote for him if the primaries were held today. He was trailing 10 other candidates: Trump, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, John Kasich, Carly Fiorina, Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee.\n\nWorse, 14 percent said they definitely would not vote for him, and 41 percent said they view him unfavorably.\n\nAt this time last year, Paul was the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination. He\u2019s now polling within the margin of error.\n\nBack in 2011, when Paul first entered the Senate, his mission was simple: make peace with the establishment gatekeepers like Mitch McConnell, ensure them he wasn't as fringe in his beliefs as his dad, and then perfect the delicate balance of appealing to both them and his dad\u2019s libertarian-leaning supporters. With the support of those two camps, it seemed possible that Paul could secure the nomination.\n\nBut something went wrong: in his attempt to compromise himself enough to appeal to the McConnell\u2019s of the party, Paul seemed to lose the qualities that made him a different and therefore exciting type of Republican in the first place. He wasn\u2019t mainstream enough to win the support of the mainstream, and he wasn't libertarian enough to energize his dad's base. As a result, Paul is now finding himself no longer backing away from his father, but running towards him. His father recently sent out a fundraising appeal for the younger Paul, and on Rand\u2019s Westward journey this week he visited communities where his last name might endear him to his dad\u2019s supporters.\n\nPaul kicked off the week in Anchorage, which is not usually a high-priority campaign stop for candidates. Asked about this, Doug Stafford, Paul\u2019s senior adviser, replied, \u201cPeople live in Alaska, Olivia. You should go there. And they have delegates to the convention. Ron did well there in 2012, and we intend to build on that for 2016.\u201d\n\nRon came in third in the Alaska caucuses, but he seemed to energize the libertarian-leaning Republicans in the state. Ron zealot Russ Millette was elected chairman of the Alaska GOP in 2012 (although he was thrown out in 2013).\n\nBefore his speech in the state, Rand Paul admitted to The Washington Post\u2019s David Weigel that he didn\u2019t think his attacks on Trump were the cause of his decline. \u201cI think if you look closely at the poll numbers, our numbers actually shifted south before I ever attacked him,\u201d he said, during an interview conducted before the four-point decline evident in the new Quinnipiac poll. \u201cWe probably didn\u2019t really go after his fake conservative-ness for probably two months. During those two months, my numbers went down, and I think my numbers have stayed the same [since].\u201d\n\nAfter Alaska, Rand traveled to other Ron Paul strongholds. He stopped in Washington State, which Ron Paul won in 2012; Wyoming, where Ron came in third; Idaho, where Ron won the straw poll with over 70 percent of the vote; and Utah, where he came in second.\n\nBut whether Rand will be able to convince his dad's supporters of his legitimacy remains to be seen. This time in August 2011, Ron Paul was averaging 9.7 percent in the polls.\n\nMillette, who is not campaigning for Rand, told Weigel that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the strength of persona that Ron does. Ron is a very deep, deep thinker when it comes to libertarian philosophy. Rand may be, too, but he doesn\u2019t project it that well. If he gets the nomination, I would probably vote for him, I guess.\u201d\n\nA year ago Rand set out to broaden the appeal of his father\u2019s ideology and create a new Republican majority.

{"entityId": 1639, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Republican frontrunner says he would\u2019ve authorized the Iraq War, and so would Hillary. Let us list the ways this is totally nonsensical.\n\nThe important thing about Jeb Bush\u2019s comments about Iraq in the Megyn Kelly interview is not this dreary question of whether he is \u201chis own man.\u201d That\u2019s a psychobabble question that can only produce a lot of bad punditry. The important thing\u2014well actually, there are two: what kind of foreign policy he\u2019d give us as president, and whether he can meet some minimal standard of truth-telling. From the looks of things we should be concerned on both fronts.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the truth. He made two statements in the interview that we should parse, the first of which was probably a lie and second of which provably was. The first: \u201cI would have [authorized the invasion], and so would have Hillary Clinton, just to remind everybody.\u201d Really, particularly given what we know now?\n\nYes, she voted for the war. I\u2019m not defending her vote. It was a craven vote, just like John Kerry\u2019s was, and they never should have cast them. But does it follow that casting a vote as a senator means that, if the senator had been commander-in-chief, the senator would have chosen to pursue that kind of presidency-defining course of action? Would have put the machinery of the state to work\u2014and massive, difficult work it was, involving thousands\u2014trying to advance the lie of tying Saddam Hussein to al Qaeda and justifying a war that had nothing to do with September 11?\n\nClinton is thought of by many these days, it seems, as a gung-ho hawk, but she really wasn\u2019t that. When she voted for the war, she tried to argue that she was not voting to give the president authority to launch preemptive war. Of course she was doing exactly that, but the point for present purposes is that she wasn\u2019t saying rah, rah, let\u2019s go kill the guy. By the time she ran for president, she hadn\u2019t yet admitted her vote was a mistake, but she had voted against funding the war and pledged to start bringing troops home in 60 days of becoming president. John McCain-Lindsey Graham she was not.\n\nIn addition, Hussein was a preoccupation, not to say obsession, of the neocon right in the 1990s, not of Hillary Clinton. Bill Clinton adopted a pretty hard line toward Hussein, between the sanctions and the flyovers and the bombings, but you\u2019ll note he never sent young American infantrymen to go have their faces and limbs blown off in his country. The famous Project for a New American Century (PNAC) \u201cStatement of Principles,\u201d (PDF) released in 1997 to rebuke Clintonian drift and demand a \u201cReaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity,\u201d was signed by 25 people, and as far as I can see not a single one of them was a Democrat (that is, all the signatories are either publicly well-known Republicans or lesser-known foreign-policy types who worked for Republican, not Democratic, administrations).\n\nBill Clinton adopted a pretty hard line toward Hussein, between the sanctions and the flyovers and the bombings, but you\u2019ll note he never sent young American infantrymen to go have their faces and limbs blown off in his country.\n\nThis is important because it means that Iraq regime change simply was not a Democratic project, which to my mind makes it quite unlikely that any Democratic president, Al Gore or Hillary Clinton or anyone possibly save Joe Lieberman, would have decided that invading a country that had nothing to do with 9-11 would have constituted a reasonable response to 9-11. Twenty-nine Democratic senators, Clinton among them, cast a cowardly vote. But that hardly means that those 29 senators, if ensconced up the way on Pennsylvania Avenue, would have staked their presidencies and legacies on that war.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the appetizer, because here\u2019s the provable lie: \u201cThe intelligence that everybody saw, that the world saw, not just the United States, was, um, was faulty.\u201d This is just a monstrous falsehood that has been repeated many times by a range of neoconservatives, some with blood on their hands and others not, but it has to be slapped down.\n\nIt\u2019s important that history not be rewritten and revised: Not all the intelligence was \u201cfaulty.\u201d Think Progress did a good job on this point yesterday, citing Paul Pillar, the ex-CIA man who oversaw Middle East intelligence at the time. As Pillar has said and written on many occasions, a lot of intelligence was correct\u2014Saddam Hussein had no stockpile of WMD and posed no imminent threat to the United States. And there were journalists, like Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel, who did great work exposing intelligence community misgivings about the administration\u2019s case for war.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t what the, ah, Cheney administration wanted to hear, so they cherry-picked bits of intelligence that would help their casus belli, and even set up ++a whole new intel operation, the Office of Special Plans, which was created precisely because the official intel wasn\u2019t saying what the administration wanted it to say, so they created an intel shop that would put out the phony product they wanted to see put out. In other words, they rejected the good intelligence and cooked up their own false intelligence, and then, when their false intelligence was revealed to be (shocker!) false, they blamed the intelligence agencies for giving them the self-same false intelligence that they cooked up.\n\nAll this tells us something, perhaps a lot, about what kind of foreign policy Bush would direct if elected. Some say he\u2019s more like his father, and Poppy\u2019s realist buddies Baker and Scowcroft, and he\u2019s not a neocon. Hard to know. But one of those 25 signers of that PNAC statement of principles was none other than Jeb Bush, then the governor of Florida. George W. was a governor then, too, but he didn\u2019t even sign it! So it seems fair to presume that Jeb believed what it said. The principles are fairly boilerplate, but even so, Bush knew what he was doing putting him name next to Cheney\u2019s and Rumsfeld\u2019s and Elliott Abrams\u2019s and Frank Gaffney\u2019s and so on.\n\nNone of this necessarily means that Bush would, say, drag the United States into a war with Iran. At the same time, let\u2019s be clear on a crucial point: Jeb didn\u2019t say he\u2019d have authorized the war in Iraq solely for the sake of his brother and peace at the Thanksgiving table. He said it also because it\u2019s where the Republican Party still is today. Most of the rest of the civilized world thinks the Iraq invasion was one of the great calamities of U.S. foreign policy history, if not the greatest. But to the neoconservative foreign policy establishment, and evidently still to the moneyed donor base too, it was still somehow the right thing to do.\n\nThat is, the people who\u2019ll be bankrolling his campaign and then filling his administration if he\u2019s elected are almost all going to be pro-preemptive war people. So it\u2019s not in comparison to his brother that we should worry whether he\u2019s his own man. It\u2019s in comparison to them.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:23.681+0000"}
{"entityId": 1640, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The war against ISIS may fail. But morally, it\u2019s the opposite of Bush\u2019s war, and if it succeeds, it will do so for precisely that reason.\n\nLast week, a Politico reporter phoned me to ascertain my thoughts on the new war. Among the questions: Was there concern among liberals that Barack Obama was in some sense now becoming George Bush, and did I see similarities between the current war and Bush\u2019s Iraq war that, come on, be honest, made me squirm in my seat ever so slightly? My answer ended up on the cutting-room floor, as many answers given to reporters do.\n\nBut since I\u2019m fortunate enough to have a column, I\u2019d like to broadcast it now, because the answer is a reverberating no. In fact it\u2019s hard for me to imagine how the differences between the two actions could be starker. This is not to say that they might not end up in the same place\u2014creating more problems than they solve. But in moral terms, this war is nothing like that war, and if this war doesn\u2019t end up like Bush\u2019s and somehow actually solves more problems than it creates, that will happen precisely because of the moral differences.\n\nThe first and most important difference, plainly and simply: Obama didn\u2019t lie us into this war. It\u2019s worth emphasizing this point, I think, during this week when Obama is at the United Nations trying to redouble international support to fight ISIS, and as we think back on Colin Powell\u2019s infamous February 2003 snow job to Security Council. Obama didn\u2019t tell us any nightmarish fairy tales about weapons of mass destruction that had already been destroyed or never existed. He didn\u2019t trot his loyalists out there to tell fantastical stories about smoking guns and mushroom clouds.\n\nThe evidence for the nature of the threat posed by the Islamic State is, in contrast, as non-fabricated as evidence can be and was handed right to us by ISIS itself: the beheading videos, and spokesmen\u2019s own statements from recruitment videos about the group\u2019s goal being the establishment of a reactionary fundamentalist state over Iraq, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. That\u2019s all quite real.\n\nDifference number two: This war doesn\u2019t involve 140,000 ground troops. That\u2019s not just a debating point. It\u2019s a massive, real-world difference. I know some of you are saying, well, not yet, anyway. Time could prove you right. But if this works more or less as planned, it establishes a new model for fighting terrorism in the Middle East\u2014the United States and Arab nations and fighting forces working together to do battle against terrorism. That\u2019s kind of a huge deal.\n\nWhich leads us to difference number three: This coalition, while still in its infancy, could in the end be a far more meaningful coalition than Bush\u2019s. The Bush coalition was an ad hoc assemblage bribed or browbeaten into backing the United States\u2019 immediate geopolitical aims. It was brought together pretty much so Bush could deflect the essentially true unilateralist charge and stand up there and say \u201c41 countries have joined together\u201d blah blah blah.\n\nObama didn\u2019t tell us any nightmarish fairy tales about weapons of mass destruction that had already been destroyed or never existed. He didn\u2019t trot his loyalists out there to tell fantastical stories about smoking guns and mushroom clouds.\n\nThis coalition is smaller, but the important point is that it\u2019s not built around a goal that is in the interest only of the United States. Defeating the Islamic State is a genuine priority for the region, and the idea that these gulf states that have been winking at or backing violent extremism for years might actually work with the United States of America (!) to fight it is little short of amazing. I\u2019m not saying Obama deserves the credit here, although it seems clear he and others in the administration have worked hard on this point. Rather, the fact is that the Saudis and the Emiratis and others are now doing, however reluctantly, what it\u2019s in their self-interest to do.\n\nWhatever their motivation, the mere fact that they\u2019re signing up for the fight is striking. One should never be optimistic about the Middle East, but if we look at the situation with a little more historical sweep, we can hope that this could be the moment when, after many years of letting these cancers spread, some key players in the Arab world start to try to get their own house in order a little bit with respect to extremism. And if they do that, maybe in the near future some of these regimes will start to see that the darkness in which they make their subjects live has to be lifted.\n\nThe irony is not lost on me that Saudi Arabia, our most crucial partner here, may well have beheaded more humans this year (46 so far) than ISIS has. But if these autarkies really do work to arrest the Islamic State, maybe they\u2019ll eventually see that the only real way to make extremism seem unappealing is to make moderation\u2014well-functioning economies, a little free speech, maybe an unrigged election now and again\u2014seem appealing.\n\nThere are many ways that what started in Syria Monday night can go wrong. I really don\u2019t think Bashar al-Assad shooting down a U.S. plane is one of them; I suspect Assad knows exactly how long it would take for the United States to decimate his entire air-defense system, and I bet the answer is \u201cnot very long.\u201d However, ISIS could shoot one down. What happens to public opinion when there\u2019s an American death, or two? When the Iraq army, even with the benefit of 200 U.S. airstrikes, can\u2019t retake any ground, as appears to be happening now? And what would Congress do in the event of such realities? At the very least Obama does have to get congressional assent in the near future.\n\nSo this war could end up being the disaster critics are predicting. But already, it\u2019s not some other things. It\u2019s not a morally dubious hegemonic enterprise built on a pile of lies. That may or may not give it a better chance of success, but at least it means we don\u2019t have to be ashamed of what our country is doing.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:23.925+0000"}

It\u2019s a rare brush with partisan political issues for the retired general, who has resisted calls to associate himself with both parties and who left the Obama Administration in 2012 after it was he was having an affair with his biographer.\n\nThe May 6 event, which also features former UN Ambassador John Bolton and former CIA director James Woolsey, is sponsored by the Gatestone Institute, a hawkish non-profit led by Bolton.

The definition of winsome is \u201ccharming, often in a childlike and na\u00efve way,\u201d and oddly enough, it fits what Perry is trying to do as he attempts a comeback in presidential politics as an affable face of conservatism with a back-to-basics economic message.\n\nHe is coming off a 14-year successful run as governor of Texas, and says the single most important thing he does in public life is create a climate where business can succeed and jobs are created. One of every 12 Americans live in Texas, and three of every eight new jobs created are in Texas, he told reporters at a lunch in Washington on Thursday sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor. It\u2019s a formula he thinks could work elsewhere and he blames the Obama administration for disrupting the country\u2019s economic engine with its pesky environmental regulations.\n\n\u201cBased on what I consider to be science that is not settled, calling CO2 a pollutant is doing a disservice to the country, a disservice to the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m substantially more concerned about Iran changing the temperature in New York than some 50-year role that could be played by environmental choices made today.\u201d\n\nPresumably, that means he thinks there\u2019s a greater threat of Iran dropping a bomb on a major city than any dangers from a warming planet. Like other Republicans who deny the science of climate change, Perry prefaces his remarks saying, \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist,\u201d but he has no hesitation to reject what the great majority of scientists say, and he faults Obama\u2019s EPA for \u201cstrangling\u201d the economy with its policies.\n\nThe most important lesson he learned from the experience was the importance of preparation. \u201cIf I do make that decision [to run again], I will be prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cI was ill-prepared to stand up in front of the people\u2026 and say, \u2018Choose me as your next leader.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmong the issues that tripped up Perry in 2012 was his support for allowing undocumented immigrants to pay in-state tuition for college. Mitt Romney and the other GOP candidates assailed Perry as soft on the issue, and since then the Republican base has moved even further to the right. With thousands of unaccompanied minors entering his state from Central America, Perry has a ready-made issue on which to look tough, and this week he ordered a surge operation on the Southern border. With hurricane season approaching, he warns that the influx of \u201cunaccompanied alien children\u201d might mean there would be no place to house Texas citizens displaced by extreme weather.\n\nPerry\u2019s harder line position on immigration and on climate change line up well with the Republican primary electorate, and it\u2019s way too early to make sweeping judgments, but in the jockeying for position, Perry tends to get eclipsed by fellow Texan Ted Cruz. \u201cWe all get our 15 seconds of fame,\u201d he said, shrugging off the comparison. \u201cAsk me in eight years if Ted Cruz has made an impact on the state.\u201d\n\nPerry called his failed 2012 bid for the GOP nomination \u201cpainful\u201d and \u201chumbling.\u201d He said the most important lesson he learned from the experience was the importance of preparation. \u201cIf I do make that decision [to run again], I will be prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cI was ill-prepared to stand up in front of the people\u2026 and say, \u2018Choose me as your next leader.\u2019\u201d Exactly what he\u2019s doing to get ready, he didn\u2019t say, but fielding questions for an hour from a room full of reporters must be part of the drill.\n\nAsked what he finds appealing about making another run for president, he said, \u201cI\u2019m a patriot, I do care about where the country is headed. I\u2019m a competitor.\u201d Whether he decides to formally announce or not, he said he wants to continue to talk about the 10th Amendment and be a champion for states\u2019 rights. He wants to be \u201ca person of influence,\u201d he said, adding with a winsome smile, \u201cAnd with my eyes somewhat beginning to fail, I\u2019m getting to be a bit of an elder statesman.\u201d That opened the door to a question about his age, that he would be 66 if elected president in 2016. \u201c66 is the new 46,\u201d he quipped, adding that voters will want experience after \u201cwatching this young, inexperienced president bumble from scandal to embarrassing debacle.\u201d\n\nPerry blamed his poor performance in 2012 on recent back surgery, and painkillers that made him seem disoriented. This time around, he said, \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I did two things. I quit running and replaced that with a lot of core exercises, a lot of sit-ups, pull-ups, crunches, and planks. And I ride an indoor bike for 45 minutes every day. And then I stopped wearing cowboy boots.\u201d He said he still gets some pain \u201cin my backside\u201d and a couple of ibuprofen take care of that. His amiability is his strong suit, and if Republicans are looking for someone with the spoonful of honey to make the medicine go down, Perry may be able to recapture some of the magic he had in 2012 before he so spectacularly flamed out.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:25.297+0000"}

But don\u2019t count out the Man Upstairs, a leading foe of LGBT rights says.\n\n2015 is shaping up to be a disaster for groups fighting gay rights in the United States.\n\nThe year started off positively for supporters of LBGT equality: same-sex marriages began in Florida on Monday, making the Sunshine State the 36th state in the country to allow it. With this milestone, Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin wrote, more than 70 percent of Americans, totaling more than 200 million people, now live in a state that recognizes marriage equality.\n\nThose opposing same-sex marriage are on their heels, and increasingly unwilling or unable to make a stand against it. Asked whether the public acceptance of gay marriage was inevitable, one of the foremost opponents of gay marriage, Maggie Gallagher, gave this vague, philosophical answer:\n\n\u201cNothing is inevitable. \u2018Inevitability\u2019 is the progressive substitute for the idea of Divine Providence,\u201d Gallagher, the former president of the anti-gay National Organization for Marriage, told The Daily Beast. \u201cEither God is in charge, or the future hasn't yet happened and is freely determined. Or God leaves us free.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the times, the ordinarily media-friendly National Organization for Marriage and the American Family Association have outsourced their press inquiries to specialized conservative consulting groups. On Monday, the two associated consulting groups told The Daily Beast they couldn't even get in touch with their counterparts at NOM or the AFA to book interviews about what 2015 holds for them.\n\n\u201cNothing is inevitable. \u2018Inevitability\u2019 is the progressive substitute for the idea of Divine Providence. Either God is in charge, or the future hasn't yet happened and is freely determined. Or God leaves us free.\u201d\n\nBy their own acknowledgement, the National Organization for Marriage is struggling: in a year-end fundraising plea, its president admitted that the group\u2019s \u201cresources are nearly exhausted\u201d going into 2015, in part due to spending in the 2014 election cycle.\n\nBut it\u2019s worse than \u201cnearly exhausted\u201d: NOM\u2019s 2013 tax filings showed the group with more than $2.5 million in debt. And their fundraising collapsed by 50 percent from the previous year.\n\n\"They have a tough road ahead, and more and more they're being honest about that. That's becoming their new cry, now they're the David against Goliath,\" said Jeremy Hooper, a political consultant who has monitored the activities of anti-LGBT groups for a decade. \u201cThey're owning the fact that they're at a loss now.\u201d\n\nThose who have watched anti-gay groups closely suggest that there will be two major strategic shifts in their strategy.\n\nFirst, as opposition to gay marriage collapses, American anti-LGBT activists will slow their battle against it. Instead, they\u2019ll fight for the rights of those who hold anti-gay views\u2014with resources shifting to so-called \u201creligious freedom\u201d groups.\n\n\"It's becoming increasingly evident that where the opponents of same-sex marriage can make a serious case is that it is a violation of religious liberty to sanction same-sex marriage,\" said Jonathan Rauch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a long-time adovate for marriage equality. \u201c[Their strategy is] to circle the wagons and say, look, if we're not going to win the debate on the public legitimacy of same-sex marriage, we can win the religious liberty one so that we don't have to be a part of this.\"\n\nAnd second, with falling support domestically, many anti-LGBT groups will take their message abroad to places where the momentum is with them.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the hardest core of anti-gay marriage advocates are turning their attention overseas, by lobbying for anti-gay marriage and anti-gay rights in places like Uganda and Russia,\u201d Rauch said.\n\nThis is where much of the action will be for anti-LGBT groups. In February, Slovakia will have a referendum on whether marriage should be defined as a union between a man and a woman. The month of May will see an Irish referendum on the legalization of same-sex marriage. In Uganda, legislators are considering further criminalization of LGBT advocacy and same-sex relationships. And the homophobia in Putin's Russia may be a contagion that spreads to former Soviet satellite states such as Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.\n\nUltimately, 2015 might be the year American anti-LGBT advocates wish they could skip. Asked about potential victories this year for those who oppose gay marriage, Gallagher replied, \u201cI suspect the focus is going to be on 2016[\u2018s presidential race,] and that social conservatives are going to struggle between choosing a champion and choosing a conventional \u2018winner.\u2019\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:25.632+0000"}
{"entityId": 1644, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Ohio governor is about to score a landslide win in a state Republicans need to win the White House. But will conservatives ever support him?\n\nAfter Ohio\u2019s governor cruises to a second term Tuesday, expect Republicans with visions of 2016 dancing in their heads to at least entertain the question: why not John Kasich?\n\nOhio is a must-win swing state for Republicans if they are to reclaim the White House. Kasich is more likely to carry his home state in a presidential election than Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is facing a much tougher reelection race and still could lose, or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nLike both of those fellow governors, Kasich has picked his share of fights with unions in a state where organized labor is indispensable to the Democratic Party. And as a nine-term veteran of the House, Kasich boasts a combination of executive and legislative experience that will be difficult for most other GOP presidential prospects to match.\n\nYet many conservatives will find the answer to \u201cwhy not John Kasich?\u201d blindingly obvious: in their view, the onetime budget-cutter has gone soft. The Associated Press recently quoted Kasich as saying of Obamacare repeal, \u201cThat\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublican John Kasich just got extremely real on Obamacare,\u201d blared liberal commentator Jonathan Chait, whose praise typically isn\u2019t helpful in Republican primaries. Chait especially liked Kasich describing the opposition \u201cas really either political or ideological,\u201d with the governor adding, \u201cI don't think that holds water against real flesh and blood, and real improvements in people's lives.\u201d\n\nKasich pushed back hard against the AP story. \"The AP got it wrong,\" Kasich tweeted. \"Ohio said NO to the Obamacare exchange for a reason. As always, my position is that we need to repeal and replace.\"\n\nThe AP, he subsequently said, \u201cscrewed up. Let me make my position simple. Repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThere are two reasons the story struck a chord, however. Kasich admits that he was talking about Medicaid expansion, which notwithstanding his office\u2019s bizarre attempt to claim otherwise is a key component of Obamacare. And while ramming that Medicaid expansion through over conservative objections in Ohio, Kasich engaged in increasingly strident attacks on limited-government conservatives.\n\nAt times, it was unclear whether Kasich was attacking such conservatives from the left or the Christian right. \u201cI had a conversation with one of the members of the legislature the other day,\u201d Kasich recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018I respect the fact that you believe in small government. I do, too. I also know that you\u2019re a person of faith.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Now, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he\u2019s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small,\u201d But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe John Kasich of the 1990s was a perfect fit for the Tea Party GOP of today.\n\nThis is almost a complete 180-degree turn from where Kasich stood in Congress. Kasich made his bones in Washington as a budget-cutter. He rose up the ranks from conservative backbencher railing against excessive spending to chairman of the House Budget Committee at the beginning of Newt Gingrich\u2019s \u201cRepublican Revolution,\u201d a precursor of sorts to Paul Ryan.\n\nLike Ryan, Kasich started out introducing alternative budgets that slashed federal spending, but these blueprints went nowhere. His first, which would have cut Medicare and frozen discretionary spending, was defeated by 393 to 30 in 1989, receiving few Republican votes.\n\nFinally, a spending cuts package he worked on with Minnesota Democratic Rep. Tim Penny\u201490 specific reductions totaling more than $100 billion\u2014came within five votes of passing the House while the Democrats still ran the place in 1993. Soon a Republican House and Senate would send his spending bills to President Bill Clinton\u2019s desk, where many of them were promptly vetoed\u2014especially when he tried to reform and restrain the growth of Medicare.\n\nKasich\u2019s crusades against government spending didn\u2019t always follow the usual partisan script. He teamed with left-wing California Democratic Rep. Ronald Dellums in an attempt to scrap the B-2 bomber. He described himself as a \u201ccheap hawk\u201d on national defense who warned, \u201cYou can't listen to the flacks in the Pentagon and the hack ideologues over at party headquarters, or you'll end up with a bunch of weapons that don't work.\u201d\n\nThe son of a mailman, Kasich always saw himself as looking out for the little guy, even when it meant having unlikely allies like liberal consumer advocate Ralph Nader. But back in the 1990s, that usually took the form of fighting corporate welfare, of which he was an early GOP critic.\n\n\u201cKasich wields his ax much less selectively than do most of his party colleagues,\u201d the New York Times Magazine reported in 1998. \u201cHe flails away at Federal social programs\u2014including Medicare, which he has proposed from time to time to subject to a means test.\u201d\n\nBack then, the Times described Kasich in a headline as \u201cA Republican with rough edges.\u201d Since he found religion on government social spending, the Gray Lady has made him the subject of such headlines as \u201cOhio governor defies G.O.P. with defense of social safety net.\u201d\n\nTwenty years ago, Kasich\u2019s faith-based defense of big government would have seemed out of place. He has always been a reliable social conservative and he became more intensely religious after the death of his parents in a 1987 automobile accident. He was a popular speaker on the Christian Coalition circuit in the Pat Robertson-founded organization\u2019s 1990s heyday and a frequent defender of conservative evangelicals\u2019 entry into GOP politics.\n\nBut Kasich wasn\u2019t exactly a moral crusader when the crusade wasn\u2019t curtailing the growth of the federal government. \u201cHe mentions abortion seldom, Monica Lewinsky never,\u201d the NYT Magazine noted in 1998, quoting him complaining about the \u201cgoody-two-shoes\u201d who \u201chave ruined religion.\u201d\n\nKasich was probably better known for dancing in a mosh pit with then California Democratic Rep. Gary Condit at a Pearl Jam concert than hobnobbing with social justice types. \u201cI like baseball, I swear a lot, I like Pearl Jam\u2014and I have a personal relationship with God,\u201d he defiantly told The New Yorker in the 1990s. \u201cBut I think He likes Pearl Jam, too.\u201d\n\nThe John Kasich of the 1990s was a perfect fit for the Tea Party GOP of today. In fact, he might have been well suited to mediate the disputes between libertarians, religious conservatives and national-security hawks now roiling the party. So why does he instead sound like Jeb Bush or even Jon Huntsman, whose rhetoric was practically designed to distract voters from his past conservative accomplishments?\n\nPerhaps the answer can be found in Kasich\u2019s last years in Congress, precisely at his moment of triumph. He was among the Republicans who negotiated with the Clinton administration a deal that led to the first balanced federal budget since 1969 while cutting taxes. But it also blew through the spending caps promised by the 1994 Contract with America and nearly matched Clinton\u2019s own request for nondefense discretionary spending in 1997.\n\nFor the first time, Kasich found himself in fiscal conservatives\u2019 crosshairs. In his book about the collapse in Republican budgetary discipline during this time period, conservative policy wonk Stephen Slivinski recounted a meeting between a disappointed Tom Coburn\u2014then a Republican congressman from Oklahoma\u2014and Kasich over the spending accord.\n\n\u201cTom,\u201d Kasich said in what Slivinski described as a \u201cslightly defensive tone,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s the best we could get.\u201d Bruised and battered by the government shutdowns in which Kasich\u2019s own spending bills had played a role, he seemed to be joining other Republican leaders in throwing in the towel on budget-cutting. Soon Kasich and Indiana Republican Sen. Dan Coats would write in the Washington Times, \u201cThe fact that government programs have not worked is no excuse for those in government not to act.\u201d\n\nKasich had planned to run for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination. He gained little traction as George W. Bush consumed all the political oxygen. Abandoning his campaign before it really began, he paid homage to Bush as his \u201csoul brother\u201d and praised compassionate conservatism\u2014a phrase that seemed at odds with everything he had tried to do in Congress.\n\nWhy not dress up conservatism with more compassionate rhetoric rather than green eyeshades? Even the most adamant Obamacare opponent must acknowledge, as Kasich has, that its coverage expansion has helped some people.\n\nKasich\u2019s shift is not merely rhetorical, however. The libertarian Cato Institute\u2019s annual report card has Kasich tied for worst-ranked Republican governor, with eight Democrats outperforming him on controlling taxes and spending. And if you take seriously his attempt to separate the Medicaid expansion from the rest of Obamacare, he is essentially arguing that we should leave in place $800 billion in new spending over the next decade while repealing many of the taxes and Medicare cuts intended to help pay for it.\n\nIf Kasich emerges as the establishment candidate, like Mitt Romney, or cultivates stronger ties to the Christian right, like Mike Huckabee, he could perhaps overcome fiscal conservatives\u2019 skepticism. George W. Bush brought the establishment and the Christian right together in 2000 and won in a walk. But Kasich doesn\u2019t exactly have his soul brother\u2019s political profile.\n\nSo far, Kasich is a divider on the right, not a uniter.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:26.106+0000"}

Clinton Presidential Center and Park.\n\nThe store sells all-things Clinton\u2014magnets, books, dolls, retro T-shirts from the 1992 campaign, sweatshirts that say \u201cI Miss Bill\u201d and hundreds of other Clinton-related items. Tourists usually flock to the store after visiting Bill Clinton\u2019s library and many arrive in Little Rock on flights that land at the Bill and Hillary National Airport.\n\nAlthough Bill and Hillary Clinton chose to live in New York after leaving the White House, the Clinton brand remains so strong in Arkansas that the state could be called Clintonland. In downtown Little Rock, Clinton Avenue leads to the Clinton presidential library, and a bust of Bill Clinton stands nears the gates of the Governor\u2019s Mansion. Hillary Clinton has a children\u2019s library named in her honor, and \u201cReady For Hillary\u201d stickers have been plastered on cars in the state for months.\n\nAnd after Hillary Clinton\u2019s announcement yesterday that she would be running for president, Clinton friends and city leaders say that another run could only be good for the state that the couple first called home.\n\n\u201cThe Clintons are like the Energizer bunny, it just keeps on going and going, and here we go again,\u201d said Skip Rutherford, dean of the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service and a longtime friend of the Clintons. Perhaps better than anyone in Arkansas, he understands the impact the Clinton brand has had on the state. After all, he helped to create it.\n\nRutherford supervised the planning and construction of the Clinton Presidential Center and Park, a formerly abandoned warehouse site near the Arkansas River, and served as founding president of the William J. Clinton Foundation. Researchers from around the world visit Little Rock to comb through documents at the Clinton library. In fact, Rutherford said plenty of researchers are currently at the archives looking through documents related to Hillary Clinton. The Clinton School of Public Service is in its 10th year and students have performed nearly 700 field service projects around the world, he said.\n\nNear the library in downtown Little Rock, construction of everything from loft apartments to hotels and restaurants has not stopped since Bill Clinton announced his library in 1997. According to the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce, the library has generated more than $2 billion in investment locally and has had a total economic impact of $3.3 billion. In the 10 years since the center opened, more than 3 million visitors from around the world have visited, and travel expenditures in Pulaski County have increased by more than 68 percent, Gretchen Hall, president and CEO of the Little Rock Convention and Visitors Bureau, said.\n\n\u201cThe Clintons have had a tremendous impact on Arkansas, and especially Little Rock,\u201d said Hall. \u201cShould Secretary Clinton be elected as president, I feel certain that the Clintons\u2019 unique place in our state and country\u2019s history, as the first woman president and first couple to be individually elected as president, would continue to raise our city\u2019s profile and have a positive impact on our tourism industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Clintons are like the Energizer bunny, it just keeps on going and going, and here we go again.\u201d\n\nBut while the Clintons may be worshipped in many pockets of Arkansas, state Republicans aren\u2019t giving Hillary an ounce of love. On Sunday, just minutes after her announcement, Arkansas Republican Party Chairman Doyle Webb said in a statement that Hillary has been running for president for more than a decade and from scandal much longer.\n\n\u201cArkansas voters are all too familiar with the Clinton political style\u2014thinking laws and regulations about transparency and accountability don\u2019t apply to them,\u201d Webb said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see how Clinton will attempt to sidestep her conflicts of interest and hypocrisies on issues important to everyday Arkansans. Hillary Clinton may be able to delete her emails, but she can\u2019t delete her record.\u201d\n\nRutherford counters that Hillary Clinton\u2019s accomplishments in Arkansas when she was the state\u2019s first lady shouldn\u2019t be forgotten. For instance, he credits her for the neonatal clinic at Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital that opened in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cWithout Hillary Clinton we wouldn\u2019t have that neonatal clinic, and think about how many lives have been saved because of her vision,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cShe was pregnant with Chelsea and she went to New York and secured funding for it.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that her work in Arkansas still pays dividends to children today. She brought the Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY) program to the state for children to have education help at home. She also worked on improving education standards in Arkansas\u2019s schools.\n\n\u201cAll of her work then wasn\u2019t for a short-term effect,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cThese things have to go through several generations to see an impact.\u201d\n\nBut for all the excitement\u2014or wariness\u2014in Arkansas at the thought of another Clinton campaign, the yellow-dog Democratic Arkansas that Hillary Clinton once knew is gone. Since her last run in 2008, the state has turned sharply to the right, with Republicans holding the governorship, both legislative chambers and all state offices. And while Bill and Hillary Clinton may retain a strong legacy in Arkansas, she may not win the state.\n\n\u201cI think it is fair to say Hillary Clinton is seen as much more of a national figure,\u201d said Jay Barth, a political science professor at Hendrix College in Conway, Ark. \u201cAnd, in particular, she\u2019s a national Democratic figure with ties to the Obama administration. While personal ties once trumped party in Arkansas politics, it\u2019s safe to say that that is no longer the case and Arkansas is a very tough state for Democrats, even one with ties to the state. President Clinton invested time heavily in the state\u2019s elections in 2014 and the result was not what he hoped or anticipated.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:26.359+0000"}

And Washington is demanding answers.\n\nThe U.S. had practically round-the-clock surveillance of the site where American hostage Warren Weinstein was held by al Qaeda in Pakistan. Yet a CIA drone strike still accidentally killed him and a fellow captive, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto. And that\u2019s again raising questions about the accuracy of drone strikes and the danger they pose to innocent civilians.\n\nA U.S. official who had been briefed on the January 14 strike told The Daily Beast that it was targeting a meeting of mid-level al Qaeda leaders at what was believed to be a compound consisting of several buildings. As the suspected jihadists pulled up, U.S. drones hit them. The U.S. official said that those conducting the strike were not sure who everyone attending the purported meeting was.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Thursday that U.S. intelligence officials \u201chad no idea [Weinstein] was there.\u201d\n\nAnother U.S. official told The Daily Beast that the government is now conducting a \u201cthorough, independent review\u201d into whether it needs to refine its assessments of the risks to hostages in future strikes. Earnest also said there is \u201can ongoing [CIA] inspector general review of this matter.\u201d A spokesman for the CIA declined to comment.\n\nObama administration officials sought to portray the hostages\u2019 deaths as an unavoidable mistake in what President Obama called, in a brief televised statement, \u201cthe fog of war.\u201d Earnest said intelligence officials had determined \u201cwith near certainty\u201d that the site was used by members of al Qaeda but not that any hostages were held at the facility.\n\nLawmakers are now asking questions about the drone attack and how it was that the CIA never knew civilians were in danger. \u201cI have asked the agency to come in to give me a deep dive on the operation and suspect that other members will want the same,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told The Daily Beast. Schiff said he\u2019d not yet discussed with the committee chairman, Devin Nunes, whether to hold a formal investigation or hearings, \u201cbut I would recommend a thorough review.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called war. It\u2019s called war. It\u2019s called war. And you\u2019re not going to stop tragedies like this from happening as long as you\u2019re in a war.\u201d\n\nCongressional overseers of the intelligence community had been previously briefed about the operation. Maryland Senator Ben Cardin, who represents Weinstein\u2019s home state, told The Daily Beast he had received a call from CIA Director John Brennan on Wednesday. Cardin also said he had personally called Weinstein\u2019s wife to offer his condolences.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee has already reviewed the operation twice, Chairman Richard Burr told The Daily Beast. He hinted that the panel looked into the matter a second time after it was realized that civilians had died in the operation. Burr didn\u2019t say when that second examination began.\n\n\u201cIf for some reason there are unintended consequences of anything that might come out of intelligence operations, we routinely take a second look at it. As it relates to this, we already have and we will continue to look into details,\u201d Burr said. \u201cThe fact that there were individuals that were killed that we didn\u2019t originally anticipate would have been affected automatically triggers a re-look.\u201d\n\nBut some lawmakers remained hawkish on the drone program, which has been a key pillar in the Obama administration\u2019s counterterrorism operations.\n\nPhoto Illustration by Dair Massey/The Daily Beast\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called war. It\u2019s called war. It\u2019s called war. And you\u2019re not going to stop tragedies like this from happening as long as you\u2019re in a war,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham. \u201cThis is part of war. You can\u2019t have a war without collateral damage.\u201d\n\nGraham said he doesn\u2019t hold the president responsible for the accidental killing of hostages. \u201cThe families blame al Qaeda, and they should. We made a mistake. I\u2019ve been a big critic of Obama\u2014I\u2019m not going to blame him for this. I blame al Qaeda\u2026 We\u2019re not going to terminate this drone program. I\u2019m sorry these two innocent civilians were killed, I\u2019m glad the two Americans collaborating with the enemy were. Please understand we\u2019re at war. It\u2019s a nasty, terrible business\u2014but I\u2019m in it to win it.\u201d\n\nThe CIA, for its part, was tracking someone whom it thought was an important, senior al Qaeda member at that compound, officials said. Precisely who he was, the CIA says it didn\u2019t know.\n\nThree months after the drone strike, they may have gotten a very public clue. On April 12, al Qaeda confirmed in a tweet that a drone strike had killed an American, Ahmed Farouq, who\u2019d become a senior member of al Qaeda. Though not among the most-well known terrorists, as deputy emir of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, Farouq had a major role in the planning of a September 2014 attack in which militants infiltrated Pakistan\u2019s navy and tried to hijack one of its ships.\n\nThe strike that al Qaeda said killed Farouq was thought to be the same strike that killed the hostages.\n\nThe American-turned-al Qaeda terrorist had been in the CIA\u2019s crosshairs just weeks before the strike on the compound. He was reportedly targeted in an earlier U.S. drone strike, in December 2014, and there were conflicting accounts about whether he\u2019d been killed.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the CIA was intensely watching the compound where Weinstein and Lo Porto were being held. Earnest said the U.S. had hundreds of hours of surveillance on the site, and in the time before the strike, \u201cnearly continuous\u201d surveillance. Whomever the CIA was looking for, he was important enough to watch without blinking.\n\nOrdinarily, Obama reviews and signs off on any strikes that target Americans, but in this case, the CIA didn\u2019t know Farouq was there, so the president didn\u2019t review the mission, officials said. The Wall Street Journal reported that the CIA observed someone they believed was a senior Al Qaeda member entering the compound, but that they didn\u2019t know it was Farouq.\n\nYet officials say that in the initial battlefield assessment conducted after the strikes, there was no evidence that either civilians or top al Qaeda leaders had been killed. Rather, questions only emerged in the last few weeks, the U.S. official said. And by this month, \u201cthere was a high level of confidence that civilians had been killed\u201d as well, the U.S. official said.\n\nEarnest said that in the weeks that followed the strike, some as yet undescribed intelligence indicated that Weinstein may have been killed. U.S. analysts followed leads and pored over hundreds of hours of surveillance video. Only in the past few days did they determine with a degree of \u201chigh confidence\u201d that Weinstein had been killed in the operation, Earnest said. Obama spoke to Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on Wednesday to tell him that Lo Porto also had been killed. The conversation was \u201crelatively short and very direct,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nThe CIA is supposed to follow a rigorous process meant to test the quality of the intelligence used in drones strikes and to ensure that civilians aren\u2019t killed in those operations. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for intelligence that would wave them off,\u201d Earnest said. Assessments about a particular targeted go through \u201ca thorough red team process\u201d to review the intelligence before any strike is conducted and \u201cto try to poke holes in it, to make sure it represents the complete picture,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nBut if the CIA drone operators\u2019 experience is anything like that of their military counterparts, there are frequently concerns about collateral damage.\n\n\u201cIf we see something that we think might have been a problem\u2026we\u2019ll report those. We report a lot of them, actually,\u201d said Colonel Jim Cluff, commander of the 432nd Air Expeditionary Wing, which runs drone operations at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada. Cluff added that he wasn\u2019t aware of any investigation going on now.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s any doubt in anyone\u2019s mind, and it happens all the time, we want to make sure,\u201d Cluff told The Daily Beast, adding that the Air Force watches a target from a variety of angles to determine whether there\u2019s any risk of collateral damage. \u201cThere\u2019s probably three or four video sources watching an event\u2026We have that ability [to say], \u2018Hey, let\u2019s hold off a second.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the case of the strike that killed Weinstein and Lo Porto, administration officials said there was no indication that civilians were in the compound. Earnest described that as illustrative of al Qaeda\u2019s willingness to keep its hostages, whom it considers particularly valuable as negotiating chips, away from the eyes of U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the U.S. intelligence showed that Weinstein and Lo Porto may have been held in the geographic area where the strike occurred, if not in the compound itself. Had they known, history suggests the CIA might have held off on the drone strike.\n\nA Taliban source told The Daily Beast that when Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl was being held by the Haqqani Network, a Taliban affiliate, \u201cmany times we were not attacked by drone, and the reason was the U.S. [did] not want to kill Bergdahl.\u201d\n\nIf the U.S. had reason to believe Weinstein might be nearby, the military could have theoretically planned a rescue mission. But Earnest said that could have posed a risk to U.S. forces and that there was no guarantee Weinstein would be found alive.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t order up a special operations raid every time we suspect a terrorist might be somewhere,\u201d Earnest said.\n\n\u201cIn this case, we had abundant surveillance of this compound,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe intelligence that there were al Qaeda figures operating in this compound proved to be correct. The intelligence that there was no one else in the compound proved to be fatally wrong.\u201d\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by Sami Yousafzai, Jacob Siegel, Noah Shachtman, Jamie Dettmer, and Barbie Latza Nadeau", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:27.495+0000"}

Then the \u2018sellout\u2019 went to work for Mitch McConnell. Meet the operative who just might bring the party back together.\n\nWhen Jesse Benton moved to Kentucky, he didn\u2019t think he would ever have to choose between them.\n\nBut in early 2013, Benton, the former aide to Rep. Ron Paul, Sen. Rand Paul, and now campaign manager to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, was booed as he walked to the bathroom in a Louisville pizza place.\n\n\u201cI had been told I had to choose, so choose I did,\u201d Benton said last week. \u201cI have no ill will toward [the University of Kentucky], and pull for them against everybody but the [Louisville Cardinals].\u201d\n\nBeing booed by Kentucky Wildcats fans for wearing a Cardinals T-shirt and navigating the Bluegrass State\u2019s intense basketball rivalry, an area that got McConnell in hot water this week, was the easy part for Benton.\n\nBeing the \u201csellout traitor\u201d (Google \u201cjesse benton traitor\u201d) who has moved from running insurgency campaigns and throwing bombs at the palace with the Paul family to guarding its gates on behalf of McConnell, Benton has learned that being in the middle of two warring factions can be hell.\n\nAt 36, Benton is one of few Republican operatives to have lived in both the Tea Party and establishment camps of a party that has repeatedly self-destructed over infighting and purity tests in recent years.\n\nDespised by many on both sides of that divide, Benton might well be the future of the party\u2014someone who knows both sides, is connected throughout, and, above all, wants to win.\n\n\u201cWhat Jesse is trying to do has never been tried by a political operative at such a high level: bringing together the two wings of the Republican Party,\u201d said Scott Jennings, former deputy political director in President George W. Bush\u2019s White House, a former top aide to McConnell and the man now advising the senator\u2019s super PACs from his firm in Louisville.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no roadmap for how to pull this off, so that means sometimes you hit a few bumps in the road,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cBut if he pulls it off\u2014and I believe he will when McConnell is reelected this year\u2014he will have created a template for the future of the GOP, where the establishment and the Tea Party find ways to work together to achieve policy and electoral victories.\u201d\n\n***\n\nWearing his uniform\u2014cowboy boots, jeans, open-collared shirt, blue blazer, and pocket square\u2014Benton rocked back and forth and gave it his all singing along in the cavernous Baptist church he and his wife, Valori, attend in Louisville. They\u2019ve bought a house and joined a modest country club.\n\nValori is Ron Paul\u2019s granddaughter. The two met at the second Republican presidential debate in 2007 in South Carolina, when Benton was working as the former congressman\u2019s communications director and Valori was her granddad\u2019s traveling assistant.\n\nOver omelets at the Bentons\u2019 club last Sunday after church, while their adorable 3-year-old daughter spread out her Disney toys on the table in front of her, Jesse Benton described how he and McConnell came to work together.\n\nIn the early part of 2010, the two men were adversaries as Benton worked to help Rand Paul shock the political world by upsetting Trey Grayson, McConnell\u2019s hand-picked successor to retiring Sen. Jim Bunning.\n\nOn the Saturday after the primary, McConnell led a unity rally in Frankfort. Whatever skepticism Benton had toward the state\u2019s senior senator dissipated that day, Benton said.\n\nAs protesters waved signs and shouted \u201cRand Paul racist,\u201d Benton said, \u201cMitch held the line and made sure every single Republican of consequence was there for this unity rally and made very, very clear that everybody in the party was rallying behind their nominee.\u201d\n\nMcConnell then fired up his fundraising machine for the upstart candidate, and the big donors who had backed Grayson and feared Paul started writing checks to Paul.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because Mitch knocked down that door for Rand,\u201d Benton said. \u201cI saw all this happen. It was really cool.\u201d\n\nJosh Holmes, who was McConnell\u2019s chief of staff and now, at the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), comprises the second head of McConnell\u2019s campaign apparatus, said McConnell was impressed by Benton as he watched the young operative build a grassroots campaign that ended with a 12-point victory for Paul.\n\n\u201cMcConnell is the single best political mind I\u2019ve ever been around so he recognizes talent immediately,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cIf you couple that with total dedication, he\u2019s interested and the seeds of that with Jesse were planted in his mind.\u201d\n\nHolmes said he and McConnell watched as Benton led Ron Paul\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, scoring \u201cunderrated\u201d political victories in early states. But it was Benton\u2019s work to get some of the elder Paul\u2019s ideas, like Federal Reserve oversight, into the Republican Party platform, that impressed McConnell the most.\n\n\u201cWe were impressed by his ability to pull together divergent political factions and move them forward under one banner,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cIn this case, he successfully implemented much of the Ron Paul agenda into the platform despite the fact that neither side felt like they won. He clearly demonstrated leadership qualities that could relate to McConnell world. That\u2019s the moment McConnell began seriously considering him for the role.\u201d\n\nAfter he finished with Paul, Benton and McConnell began a long series of conversations, many in McConnell\u2019s U.S. Capitol hideaway, getting to know each other and discussing the challenges that lied ahead as McConnell, approval numbers deeper underwater than the Titanic, plotted to win a sixth term.\n\n\u201cWhat had sort of not necessarily seemed like it made the most sense at the beginning, really started to make sense,\u201d Benton said.\n\nTo Holmes and McConnell, Benton had proved himself on the right battlefields.\n\n\u201cWe needed someone who had run a presidential campaign who wouldn\u2019t flinch at red-hot scrutiny,\u201d Holmes recalled. \u201cWe needed someone who had run and won a campaign in Kentucky. And we needed someone who could organize a cutting-edge ground-game that united all sides of the party. The number of operatives in that category is basically Jesse.\u201d\n\n***\n\nWhen Benton signed on with McConnell, he wrote an op-ed in The Daily Caller explaining why.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help.\n\nTo the far right, the same people who propelled Ron Paul to more success than anyone would\u2019ve guessed in 2012, Benton is a traitor: He threw his candidate under the bus in a colluded effort to elect Mitt Romney, a phony conservative, and then went to work for McConnell, the most evil and well-known face of the establishment, earning chatroom disdain and death threats along the way.\n\nThough pretty and quick to offer a sweet smile, Valori Benton is tough. She recently caught a would-be burglar in the garage of their new home and chased him out into the street.\n\nBut she grimaced at the mention of \u201cdeath threats,\u201d saying quietly that there have \u201cbeen some tough times.\u201d\n\nJesse Benton explained, lowering his voice in front of his family, that, for lack of a better term, he was \u201cRon\u2019s asshole.\u201d\n\nBenton and others believe they can reunite the Republican Party in Kentucky, paving the way for McConnell to become Senate Majority Leader and for Paul to launch a presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cSome of the people that were the most critical of me during the last three races were Ron\u2019s own supporters. I mean they were pretty brutal toward me,\u201d Benton said wistfully. \u201cOn orders from Ron, I would do the things and have to say the things that were unpopular with his hard-core supporters.\n\nWhen asked for an example, Benton laughed.\n\n\u201cThat Ron was not going to be the nominee of the Republican Party,\u201d he said.\n\nThe disdain from the Tea Party was compounded by mistrust from the establishment\u2014a man with no home trying to keep two islands together\u2014after Benton was recorded saying on the phone that he was going to \u201chold my nose\u201d and get through the McConnell campaign just to help Rand Paul position himself for 2016.\n\nThe incident nearly destroyed the relationship Benton and McConnell had built, giving Democrats endless fodder with which to attack the senator.\n\n\u201cIt was horrible. It was horrible,\u201d Benton said somberly. \u201cWhen you really respect somebody, and there are a handful of people I\u2019ve ever worked for or been around when I really respected them, where a quiet look in the eye and a quiet word and just them letting them know that they were disappointed in me was more crushing than any ass-chewing I could\u2019ve have ever gotten. That\u2019s how it was with Mitch.\n\n\u201cHe just came in, he sat down in my office, he looked me in the eye and he goes \u2018Jesse, I\u2019m just disappointed. I don\u2019t know how you could\u2019ve said something like that.\u2019 Man, that was tough. That was tough.\u201d\n\nTough as it was, and will no doubt continue to be when Democrats start running ads further into the campaign, the operative\u2019s nightmare scenario bonded the two men together.\n\n\u201cIf there was ever any question about me being loyal to him 100 percent, it ended that moment,\u201d Benton said.\n\nHolmes, who has been with McConnell for more than seven years, said that \u201cthere isn\u2019t a single person beyond Sen. McConnell himself who has more skin in the game here than Jesse.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the time this all came out, everyone knew damn well he would lay down in traffic for Sen. McConnell, just as he would for Sen. Paul or Ron Paul,\u201d Holmes said.\n\nBenton acknowledges that it\u2019s \u201cdefinitely more stressful\u201d to be at the forefront of McConnell\u2019s slog to reelection and a possible Republican Senate Majority than it was to run Ron Paul\u2019s long-shot campaign for the presidency.\n\n\u201cMy fear of losing this race is tremendous,\u201d Benton said. \u201cIt keeps us up at night, it keeps our stomachs churning. In the back of our minds, it\u2019s like if we lose... it\u2019s just unacceptable. Losing is unacceptable. We\u2019re not going to even consider that as an option. And I\u2019ve treated past campaigns like that even though other people [chuckles] didn\u2019t necessarily share my way of thinking.\u201d\n\n***\n\nBenton is, at heart, a political operative. He keeps a stack of \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d door-hangers in the console of his Toyota Tundra pickup truck, and when he has a spare few minutes, Benton looks at the app on his iPhone that tells him which doors need literature.\n\nHe can do three doors in 15 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s that kind of doggedness that has won the respect of the Pauls and McConnell.\n\nConventional wisdom has long held that Benton\u2019s role with McConnell is purely transactional. Like an NBA trade, McConnell got Benton to shore up Tea Party support in case there was a primary challenge, and in exchange, Rand Paul gets protection from and connections to the GOP establishment.\n\nWhile the relationship between Paul and McConnell has at times been fraught with tension, both camps have largely come to believe that one cannot be successful without the other.\n\nNobody believes that more than Benton, but both efforts have been somewhat complicated by Matt Bevin, the Louisville businessman challenging McConnell in the May 20 Republican primary.\n\nRand Paul took a lot of the same heat Benton did when the junior senator endorsed McConnell\u2019s reelection. It got hotter when Bevin got in the race.\n\nPaul is visibly uncomfortable talking about Bevin, and McConnell\u2019s leveling blows against his challenger make the situation even more awkward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not great for Rand, and Bevin\u2019s being a real jerk about it, too,\u201d Benton said. \u201cHe wants to make it awkward, and I think that\u2019s a shame.\u201d\n\nBevin, along with state and national Democrats, delight in trying to drive a wedge between McConnell and Paul.\n\n(\u201dWith respect to Matt\u2019s relationship with Rand... ask Rand,\u201d Bevin spokeswoman Rachel Semmel said. \u201cThis race isn\u2019t about Jesse Benton. It\u2019s about Mitch McConnell\u2019s liberal record of caving to Obama.\u201d)\n\nBut from outward appearances, the tension between Bevin and Paul has also sparked friction between Paul and Benton.\n\nKentucky reporters speculated that Paul and Benton were destined for an awkward Thanksgiving last November after Paul had to rein in his friend and ally when Benton said that Paul \u201cmisspoke\u201d when the senator called Bevin \u201ca good, honest, Christian man.\u201d\n\nPeople close to Paul say that the senator understands that Benton is doing what operatives do, but Paul does not like having words put in his mouth no matter who is putting them there.\n\nIn a statement for this story, Rand Paul said that \u201cJesse is a good friend and a key part of our successful campaign from the beginning. I enjoy working with him and value his advice, expertise, and sharp political instincts.\u201d\n\nBenton, who lived in Paul\u2019s basement during the 2010 campaign, said he doesn\u2019t worry about lasting tension between the two, even as the primary figures to get nasty.\n\n\u201cRand and I have a strong bond\u2014after all, we\u2019re family, and he has always treated me that way,\u201d Benton said. \u201cIf he could survive me living with him for a year and still like me, I don\u2019t think a campaign will get in the way.\u201d\n\nThe key to Paul\u2019s success is expanding his base of support beyond the Tea Party while keeping that base intact. The harder Benton hits Bevin, the more that coalition is liable to turn on Paul.\n\nFortunately for Benton, McConnell, and Paul, Bevin\u2019s candidacy has never really taken off and a full-fledged rebellion has yet to take shape\u2014\u201cThere\u2019s probably 2,000 activists in the whole state who are all ramped up,\u201d Benton said.\n\n\u201cI am sure it\u2019s not always easy, and Jesse has confided in me that it causes some occasional heartburn,\u201d said Lexington, Ky. native Nate Morris, a friend of both Benton and Paul and a likely official with a Paul for President campaign. \u201cBut I know he thinks it is extremely important for the future of the party.\u201d\n\nBenton and others in both McConnell and Paul\u2019s camps believe that on May 21, they can reunite the Republican Party in Kentucky, paving the way for McConnell to become the Senate Majority Leader and for Paul to launch a presidential campaign headquartered in Louisville if he decides to run.\n\nOn that day, Benton and the McConnell campaign will have to put on their hardhats and go to work to repair the party in the state so Republicans don\u2019t stay home in November. Given that Benton and Team Mitch routinely refer to Bevin as a \u201ccon man,\u201d that might not be an easy task.\n\nWhen asked how difficult it will be to bring back Republicans who have turned against McConnell, especially after a scorched-Earth primary, Benton took a long pause.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very magnanimous in our victory,\u201d Benton said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to try to be as humble as we possibly can and welcome everybody back in.\u201d\n\n***\n\nDriving through the outskirts of Louisville on a chilly, sunny Sunday afternoon, Benton was asked about the widely held assumption that after November, he will return to Randland to help Paul run for the Senate, the presidency, or both.\n\nBenton said he and Paul have yet to have that conversation, but he added,\u201dif we don\u2019t win this one, it won\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nBenton explained later that he had two reasons for saying that: \u201cOne, if we can\u2019t reelect Mitch McConnell, a statesman, true conservative, and legislator who leads, gets things done, and is a real treasure for our country, then our party is going to be in a lot of trouble for cycles to come.\n\n\u201cPart two, if I were to lose this race, the shine would be off my apple and no one would care what I do.\u201d\n\nBenton is no doubt right about part two, and he has a heavy lift as McConnell is locked in a reelection battle with 35-year-old likely Democratic nominee Alison Lundergan Grimes.\n\nBut, as Jennings noted, if Benton \u201ccan pull it off,\u201d he would likely be the most desired Republican staffer in the country as the parties turn their full attention from the midterms to the 2016 presidential race.\n\n\u201cJesse\u2014through Rand and Mitch\u2014is perhaps blazing a trail for the future of the GOP, and the nattering nabobs would do the conservative cause a great service by just laying off and letting the man work,\u201d Jennings said.\n\nBenton disputes the idea that the Republican Party is in the middle of a civil war, but he acknowledges that someone like Rand Paul, who has some credibility with both camps, could potentially heal such a divide in 2016.\n\nAnd of course Benton would likely be in the driver\u2019s seat of such an effort.\n\n\u201cThere is a definite need for operatives who have the ability and interest to unite conservatives,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cJesse has that capability. I don\u2019t know whether it is a party chairman someday or volunteering at his kid\u2019s school-board meeting, but he will always be working to improve his community and he\u2019s willing to take the arrows to actually accomplish it.\u201d\n\nIf McConnell were to lose in November, Benton\u2019s stewardship of a campaign that has stumbled repeatedly from unforced errors would heavily into the post-mortem blame game.\n\nBut to the fragile coalition of Team Mitch, those standing with Rand and the guy at the nexus of the two worlds, defeat is an impossibility that cannot happen as they stand on the cusp of reuniting and rebuilding the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even imagine trying to look [McConnell] in the eye and tell him we weren\u2019t going to win,\u201d Benton said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. And that won\u2019t happen.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:27.921+0000"}

Instead, Priebus has shifted instead to the more technocratic side of politics, putting in place year-round ground operations in battleground states, making investments in technology, and re-doing his party\u2019s primary calendar to head off a repeat of the 23 debates that turned the 2012 Republican primary contest into a clown show.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve fundamentally reshaped the way we do business at the RNC,\u201d he told reporters over breakfast in Washington sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. While Mitt Romney\u2019s loss to President Obama in 2012 was seen by some in the party as a mismatch on issues, others in the GOP attributed the loss of a race Romney should have won given the state of the economy to the GOP\u2019s failure to keep up with the Obama campaign\u2019s efforts to identify and turnout potential voters.\n\nSaying he wasn\u2019t blaming any one person or previous RNC chairs, Priebus described a situation where \u201cslowly over time the RNC had become a U-Haul trailer of cash hooked up to a candidate for a short period of time, and then disappearing for four years.\u201d In Priebus\u2019s opinion, this left the party atrophied and ill-equipped to deal with the onslaught of new technology, much of it pioneered by the Obama campaign. In an attempt to change this approach, the GOP is now sending party operatives out across the country. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you we\u2019ve carpeted the world,\u201d Priebus said, but 91 percent of the RNC staff is \u201cfanned out across the country,\u201d and thanks to vastly improved technology they have at their fingertips all the tools that tens of millions of dollars was able to buy.\n\nThe special election in Florida earlier this month was a test case, and the RNC chair claimed that Republican candidate won in part because the GOP\u2019s field operation was demonstrably better than the Democrat. This, combined with the Obamacare backlash, proved decisive in his analysis. \u201cWe\u2019re in for a tsunami type election in 2014,\u201d Priebus said, forecasting \u201ca very big win in the Senate\u201d that would give the GOP majority control. \u201cThe question is whether we can build on this for 2016 and pick a candidate people feel they can sit down and have a beer with.\u201d\n\nAs bullish as Republicans are about the midterms and their better than even chance to gain control, the mood is something closer to despair about winning the White House in 2016. To boost the possibility of producing a stronger nominee than Romney was by the end of the primaries, Priebus has shortened the primary calendar and announced the start date for the convention will be June 27 or July 18, 2016 (as opposed to late August). Eight cities have applied to host the convention compared to just 3 four years ago, and the winner will be announced in August.\n\nThe change that got the most attention from reporters was Priebus\u2019 almost offhand remark that the debate moderators would be \u201chandpicked.\u201d Asked who\u2019s blackballed, Priebus said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a list. I know it when I see it.\u201d He said he is looking for people \u201cwho truly care about the party, and the process.\u201d The RNC was heavily criticized in 2012 for agreeing to debates hosted by media outlets perceived as unsympathetic like MSNBC as opposed to Fox News. \u201cWe need to take control of our nominating process, which I don\u2019t think we did in 2012,\u201d he said, explaining he wasn\u2019t sure what \u201cconcept\u201d he would follow to do so.\n\nPriebus\u2019 term is up in another seven or eight months, and he was coy about whether he would run again. If Republicans can take back control of the Senate, as he seems confident they will do, he can probably write his own ticket and he\u2019ll be forgiven for suggesting back in those dark days after the 2012 election that the party should focus on immigration reform and do a better job of reaching out to minorities and talking to women. From his perspective, because of what he calls \u201cthe toxicity\u201d of Obamacare, other issues have lost their urgency in rallying voters, and the kind of reform he once advocated can be safely set aside, at least until 2016.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:28.123+0000"}

Tom Cotton knocked off Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor and former GOP Rep. Asa Hutchinson, who helped lead the charge to impeach President Clinton, won the race to become Arkansas\u2019 next governor. Hutchinson defeated Mike Ross, a former congressman whose first job in politics was serving as Bill Clinton\u2019s driver, to win the governor\u2019s mansion where Bill and Hillary once lived.\n\nDespite Clinton\u2019s seven trips to the state to campaign for the 2014 Democratic ticket, nothing he did could hold off the Republican wave that swept the state. The Democratic ticket was ultimately drowned out by the tide of anti-Obama sentiment in Arkansas, where the president has a 30 percent approval rating.\n\nThe Associated Press declared Cotton the winner two minutes after the polls closed, as Cotton swamped Pryor 56 percent to 40 percent, while Ross lost to Hutchinson 55 percent to 42 percent.\n\nIn his victory speech Tuesday night, Cotton declared, \u201cThe people of Arkansas have made their choice.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe shift in political power completes the partisan realignment of the state that began in 2010, when Republicans defeated incumbent Sen. Blanche Lincoln by more than 20 points, took control of the state legislature in 2012 for the first time in more than 100 years, and eventually swept all four House seats.\n\nAt one debate, Cotton tied Pryor to Obama by saying the latter\u2019s name more than 70 times.\n\nCotton, a lanky Harvard-educated lawyer and Army combat veteran, burst onto the political scene in 2012 when he easily won his Arkansas House seat and became the \u201canti-Rand,\u201d vocally defending the Iraq War as \u201cjust and noble\u201d and rejecting his party\u2019s growing libertarian inclinations on global affairs.\n\nThat unapologetically hawkish posture won over the likes of former President George W. Bush, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Sen. John McCain, GOP mega donor Sheldon Adelson, former Rep. Allen West, and the John Bolton PAC, all of whom donated generously to Cotton\u2019s Senate bid\n\nCotton was also heavily bankrolled by the securities industry, the largest sector to donate to Cotton\u2019s campaign, and Elliott Management Corp., the hedge fund run by Paul Singer, a neocon defense hawk.\n\nAlthough Sen. Pryor committed a number of unforced errors during the campaign, including stumbling when asked whether he believed President Obama had properly responded to the Ebola outbreak, the president\u2019s unpopularity in Arkansas seemed to doom Pryor from the start.\n\nAt one debate, Cotton tied Pryor to Obama by saying the latter\u2019s name more than 70 times. American Crossroads, another big funder for the pro-Cotton effort, plowed more than $500,000 into ads portraying the Pryor and the president as essentially the same person.

To work for Jarrett is to discover someone who listens and someone who expects nothing less than the very best.\n\nWith all of the recent conversation about Valerie Jarrett, there's an aspect of her work that still hasn't received much attention: her impact on the next generation of Washington leadership. This is a critically important role, and something I've seen firsthand.\n\nIn the second half of 2007, Valerie quite literally saved the Obama presidential campaign. We were hemorrhaging support in the late summer and fall of that year, and a sort of depression was settling in among some field and political staff in early primary states. We lagged far behind Hillary Clinton in many of those contests, even among black voters, who didn\u2019t see the campaign making the types of decisions that indicated we wanted their support.\n\nThe last straw was when Congressman John Lewis\u2014the Civil Rights legend\u2014came out in support of Hillary Clinton in October 2007. That announcement dealt a huge blow to our morale internally and to the case that we made to minority voters externally. It was hard to talk about making history when the real history-makers like Lewis weren\u2019t backing you.\n\nOne core problem was that our young, diverse campaign staff didn\u2019t always feel heard by the powers that be. There were strategic recommendations, views on where the candidate should go, and political intelligence among these lower and middle ranks of staffers, but few places to send them. This resulted in missed opportunities, depressed morale\u2014and declining poll numbers in states where the support of young people, African Americans, Latinos, and other minorities was key.\n\nThat\u2019s when Valerie stepped in. She had functionally been a volunteer and an occasional advisor up to that point, but after the Lewis disaster it was clear she needed to take a larger role. So she more formally joined the ranks of the campaign\u2019s senior leadership. And as soon as she became a regular presence at our Michigan Avenue headquarters, things started to change.\n\nYoung, black, Latino, women, and gay staffers felt like they had a listening ear and advocate in the upper tiers of the campaign\u2014at times after making a quiet trip to Valerie\u2019s office. The diversity of our endorsements started trending in the right direction, often after a phone call from Valerie to a key supporter. Then-Senator Obama began attending the types of base-rallying events that got people in the early states energized, often after a nudge from Valerie. And in states like South Carolina\u2014which was so central to the campaign\u2019s trajectory after the devastating loss in New Hampshire\u2014Obama finally got his footing, and turned things around.\n\nWashington doesn\u2019t long abide people that it can\u2019t control, and Valerie is just a tad beyond the establishment\u2019s reach.\n\n\n\nI saw all of this myself. Valerie brought a level of empathy and spirit to the hardened machinery of elections that we sorely needed in order to match our hopeful rhetoric with the reality of the campaign. Perhaps more importantly, she protected and elevated causes and voices\u2014diverse voices\u2014that would have otherwise never been heard. Valerie\u2019s new role sometimes led to friction among existing campaign leadership, but the end result\u2014a broad and deep coalition, and a winning campaign\u2014was clearly worth it. She was an outsider who came inside, and she made the insiders that much better.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Valerie has done in the White House, and quite frankly why some of the elders in this town are scared to death of her\u2014if the articles in Politico and The New Republic published about her this past week are any indicator.\n\nValerie is still something of an outsider, although she has been in our nation\u2019s capitol for a while now. Washington doesn\u2019t long abide people that it can\u2019t control, and Valerie is just a tad beyond the establishment\u2019s reach. She owes few favors; she doesn\u2019t need to rely on anyone for a media hit, consulting contract, or her next job. Whisper campaigns don\u2019t diminish her status in the eyes of Obama\u2014the two are friends, pure and simple, and the president has long since concluded that, outside sniping aside, Valerie has his best interests in mind. Perhaps most frustrating for the powers that be is that Valerie Jarrett has built her own base of support from the ground up\u2014outside groups whose progressive causes she proudly champions, and young, influential staff whose voices she has empowered.\n\nI\u2019m one of those voices. After several years of working for Obama, I came into the White House a 26-year old department head charged with engaging the faith community on some pretty tough issues. At that age I had little leverage other than work ethic, intense loyalty to the president, and the strength of my ideas.\n\nBut that was enough for Valerie. I could bring concepts to her and have them considered on their merits. If they were well thought through, with a clear plan of execution, she was in, and ready to go to the mat.\n\nIt\u2019s not just me. There is certainly an \u201cObama generation\u201d of young leaders who came out of the 2008 campaign and have been inspired by the president to enter public service\u2014but a large and growing subset of that crowd is a \u201cValerie Generation\u201d as well. Washington is teeming with women, minorities, LGBT, disabled, and other brilliant staffers who might have had a tough time getting a shot in \u201cThis Town\u201d if it weren\u2019t for Valerie Jarrett believing in them. She helped place this new generation of leaders in roles of significance in the White House and broader administration. Washington is a heck of a lot better as a result, and will be for years to come.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2014Valerie may be a mom-like figure to many of us, but she's still tough as nails. She\u2019s the type of mom who will kick your tail and quickly tell you to put your big-boy pants on. She wakes up early, works until very late, starts meetings precisely on time and demands nothing short of excellence from her team. It can be a jarring experience being on the opposite side of a debate from Valerie; I\u2019ve been there a few times, and just barely lived to tell the tale. But she respects grit and determination, in allies and opponents alike.\n\nA lot of folks this week have responded to the absurd question, \u201cWhat does Valerie Jarrett really do?\u201d The immediate answer is clear: she promotes the administration\u2019s policies among outside stakeholders, receives and incorporates feedback from those groups on the president\u2019s agenda, and provides regular, high level strategic advice to the president himself and those around him. I have no idea why that job description is difficult to understand; in absence of any good reason, her gender and race have to come to mind.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lesser-known part of her role that I have seen over the years and experienced myself. Valerie pours much of herself into those around her, and has created a generation of tough, smart, capable young leaders, people who will be in Washington long after she formally wraps up her time on Pennsylvania Avenue. Valerie isn't going anywhere, and her work will extend through those she has cultivated and inspired.

If the bill passes the state Assembly and wins voter approval April 7, the next chief justice, selected by the court\u2019s conservative majority, will almost certainly be Justice Pat Roggensack.\n\nJustice Roggensack may not yet be chief, but she has already led the Wisconsin Supreme Court through an era of remarkable procedural change. The court\u2019s justices are elected and run campaigns, complete with TV ads, one of which earned Justice Michael Gableman an ethics charge in 2009. Most important, the justices can establish political committees to accept donations on their behalf from individuals, corporations, and what remains of Wisconsin\u2019s unions.\n\nIn 2010, Justice Roggensack and the three other conservatives on the bench ruled that, \u201ca judge shall not be required to recuse himself or herself in a proceeding based solely on any endorsement or the judge\u2019s campaign committee\u2019s receipt of a lawful campaign contribution, including a campaign contribution from an individual or entity involved in the proceeding.\u201d The ruling, which was met with an angry dissent from Chief Justice Abrahamson and the other liberal justices, dictates that a justice can rule on a case\u2014or at least cannot be forced to recuse himself\u2014even if one of the parties in the case contributed to that justice\u2019s campaign committee.\n\nJustices are free to rule on cases involving parties that spent independently on the justices\u2019 behalf in addition to those donating directly to candidate committees.\n\nWhat might appear to be a fairly straightforward model for corruption of the judiciary is, according to Justice Roggensack, completely legitimate. Channeling the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Justice Anthony Kennedy, the conservatives ruled that such an arrangement does not undermine public confidence in the court, nor does it promote the appearance of corruption. Instead, they maintained that if justices were forced to recuse themselves, groups could force them off cases by donating to their campaigns or running ads on their behalf. The conservative justices also made the remarkable argument that a Supreme Court justice\u2019s recusal \u201calters the number of justices reviewing a case as well as the composition of the court.\u201d\n\n\n\nJustice Roggensack and her Supreme allies\u2019 dealings with conflicts of interest do not end there. The court agreed last year to hear a case resulting from the much-publicized \u201cJohn Doe\u201d investigation into possible violations of campaign finance law by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s campaign during the recall elections of 2011 and 2012. That investigation has faced considerable opposition from the governor\u2019s office, as might be expected. But it also has run into sustained legal challenges from outside political groups, resulting in numerous delays and moratoriums on the investigation.\n\nAmong those groups are Wisconsin Club for Growth and Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce. Both are named among the outside political groups with which the Walker campaign is alleged to have coordinated. Both ran so-called issue ads in support of Walker that disparaged his opponents. And, along with another group called Citizens for a Strong America, both have contributed more than $8 million to elect the four conservative justices on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\n\nThe 2010 ruling helped those justices build a platform to justify their participation in the John Doe case. Scot Ross, a liberal activist and head of One Wisconsin Now, called the decision a \u201cget-out-of-jail-free card\u201d for powerful interests that invest in Supreme Court races. \u201cThe vast majority of spending to elect these four justices was done by these entities,\u201d Ross told the Wisconsin State Journal.\n\nIn 2011, \u201c$3 out of every $4\u201d spent to elect Justice David Prosser, a member of the court\u2019s conservative wing, came from outside groups. Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce spent $1.1 million on Justice Prosser\u2019s behalf, while Club for Growth dished out $520,000. He is now expected to rule impartially in a case alleging that both of those groups broke the law.\n\nAt the top of the 2010 decision to reform the recusal procedures, there is an explanation of how the case came to be. \u201cOn September 30, 2008, and October 16, 2009, the Wisconsin Realtors Association, Inc. and Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, respectively, petitioned this court to amend the Code of Judicial Conduct.\u201d Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce sought the rule change after another justice, Annette Ziegler, came under fire for hearing a case pushed by the group after it had spent $2.2 million to get her elected. The ruling makes clear in Section 2 that justices are free to rule on cases involving parties that spent independently on the justices\u2019 behalf in addition to those donating directly to candidate committees.\n\nThe state Assembly is expected to take up and pass the constitutional amendment on chief justice selection Thursday, in time for it to make the April 7 election ballot as a referendum. Spring elections are notorious for their low turnout\u201419 percent voted in April 2013\u2014and the measure is expected to succeed. The court will likely have a new chief justice just in time for its ruling on the John Doe case, expected to be issued this summer.\n\n\n\nFor their part, the Republicans in the state legislature insist the amendment is not partisan. \u201cThis is not about the current chief justice,\u201d said the bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican Sen. Tom Tiffany. \u201cI believe this is the most appropriate way for our chief justice to be named.\u201d A proposed Senate bill, an amendment that would establish age limits for Supreme Court justices that would remove Chief Justice Abrahamson, 81, from the court altogether, would appear to belie that notion.\n\nEither way, Abrahamson\u2019s tenure as chief justice is likely over, as is the liberal minority\u2019s primary means of asserting itself. The chief justice has no more power than the associates but can delay decisions she disagrees with using procedural tools. Abrahamson, and much of the strength to resist the tightening grip of special interests, seems to be fading away.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:29.474+0000"}

How is that constitutional?\n\nEd O\u2019Keefe of the Washington Post summarized the recent spending bill, and caught a generally-ignored tidbit on abortion. \u201cThe bill once again bans using federal funding to perform most abortions; blocks the use of local and federal funding for abortions in the District of Columbia; and blocks the use of federal dollars for abortions for federal prisoners,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe DC item speaks for itself. It illustrates once again Congress\u2019s hypocrisy on issues of fiscal federalism and local control.\n\nThe item on federal prisoners was disturbing in a different way. It deserves more attention than it is likely to receive.\n\nFollowing the Post\u2019s weblinks, I found the following language:\n\n1 GENERAL PROVISIONS\u2014DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\n\n\u2026\n\nSEC. 202. None of the funds appropriated by this title shall be available to pay for an abortion, except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape: Provided, That should this prohibition be declared unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this section shall be null and void.\n\nSEC. 203. None of the funds appropriated under this 16 title shall be used to require any person to perform, or facilitate in any way the performance of, any abortion.\n\nSEC. 204. Nothing in the preceding section shall remove the obligation of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to provide escort services necessary for a female inmate to receive such service outside the Federal facility: Provided, That nothing in this section in any way diminishes the effect of section 203 intended to address the philosophical beliefs of individual employees of the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to know that the \u201cphilosophical beliefs of individual employees of the Bureau of Prisons\u201d are so well protected. But what about the philosophical beliefs of thousands of incarcerated pregnant women (PDF) across the United States? Roughly one out of every 33 women who enter the federal prison system is pregnant. Whatever she has done, each of these women has a constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy if that is what she chooses to do. Her right to autonomy, privacy, and bodily integrity is not abrogated because she has been convicted of a federal crime or is sent to prison.\n\nGiven everything else going on, this particular provision won\u2019t face political heat.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real. The language of this bill is a de facto abortion ban for most pregnant federal prisoners. Similar language has been included in spending bills since 1987.\n\nI am surprised that this measure is even constitutional. Indeed it probably isn\u2019t. Note the preemptive language: \u201cProvided, That should this prohibition be declared unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this section shall be null and void.\u201d\n\nAs the University of Michigan\u2019s Sam Bagenstos explained over email, when government takes a woman into custody, and accordingly deprives her of the opportunity to pursue her own ends, it assumes a corresponding obligation to facilitate her exercise of her constitutional rights. This government obligation is limited by practical considerations of safety and security. That\u2019s not what\u2019s at issue here. A legislature can\u2019t just decide that it doesn\u2019t like the exercise of a particular constitutional right and then block prisoners\u2019 ability to effectively exercise it.\n\nWhatever the constitutional arguments, it\u2019s pathetic that such questions even arise. Given everything else going on, this particular provision won\u2019t face political heat. Which politician wants to defend federally-subsidized abortions for convicted criminals?\n\nThat\u2019s too bad. It is pretty barbaric to force women to carry their pregnancies to term\u2014particularly women who are locked up within our federal prison system. This is especially barbaric when one considers the actual circumstances of these women. Fewer women are shackled during labor and delivery (PDF), though this still occurs. A much larger number are immediately separated from their infants, who are typically placed in some form of out-of-home care.\n\nSome of these women have committed ugly crimes. Others haven\u2019t. Less than eight percent of sentenced federal women prisoners are there for violent crimes or weapon offenses. Fifty-seven percent are incarcerated for drug offenses.\n\nTheir crimes are really beside the point. Everyone is entitled to be treated with basic decency and respect. I don\u2019t for a moment believe that politicians would impose such harsh measures on a more-advantaged group of women. Yet here we are, dispensing another dollop of inhumanity to some of the most troubled and despised people in America.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:29.732+0000"}

Biden learned that the leadership had been assumed by Morris\u2019 son, who is also named Robert.\n\nThat clearly resonated with Biden, who is grieving the loss of his son, Beau. Biden spoke to Morris not as vice-president to firefighters, but as one father to another.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool when your son winds up better than you,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden had used much the same line during Thursday\u2019s taping of the new Stephen Colbert show, saying it was something his own father would say.\n\nOne of the firefighters signaled by his reply that Biden had passed the test. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re all right,\u201d the firefighter said.\n\nBut Biden seemed to be repeating it not for effect but because his son is so much on his mind. Morris appeared to become choked up, which is not something that could have possibly happened if he had felt Biden was anything but sincere.\n\nFamilies of those who had died on 9/11 were there, sitting at tables set up for the observance on the apparatus floor, their loved ones memorialized by plaques affixed to the wall. Biden has lost a wife and a daughter as well as a son and he met with the families AS privately as circumstances allowed.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t know, these anniversaries don\u2019t get any easier,\u201d he was heard to say. \u201cIt all comes back.\u201d\n\nHe spoke to Lorraine Foley, sister of fallen Firefighter Gerard Nevins, in the shared language of loss.\n\n\u201cTook me a long, long, long time,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden also spoke to the firefighters. One later noted that he looked them in the eye and seemed actually to listen to what they had to say. They posed for a photo with him.\n\n\u201cYour reputation\u2019s going to take a hit taking a picture with me,\u201d Biden half joked.\n\nOne of the firefighters signaled by his reply that Biden had passed the test.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re all right,\u201d the firefighter said.\n\nThe firefighter was not talking about Biden\u2019s politics, but about Biden himself, not his views, but his worth as a person as it might have been weighed by the brothers memorialized on those plaques. The firefighter afterwards offered a high compliment.\n\n\u201cGenuine,\u201d the firefighter said.\n\nBiden had come with Billy Joel and Gov. Andrew Cuomo. He departed with them, having made a favorable enough impression on the firefighters that he would surely be welcomed back.\n\nAfterwards, one of the firefighters theorized that the very fact Biden had visited the firehouse meant he was seriously contemplating a run for president.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s interested,\u201d the firefighter said.\n\nIf Biden does run, his ability to pass an authenticity test even in a place such as the quarters of Rescue 1 could be decisive.\n\nTo be genuine would be a great strength at a time when Hillary Clinton seems ALL THE MORE contrived for trying to be spontaneous and people are responding to Donald Trump no matter what he says simply because he seems to be saying what he really thinks at that moment.\n\nIn the past, the knock on Biden has been that he utters whatever pops into his brain. Trump has made this into a big positive and that could make it the same for Biden.\n\nThe next time Biden walks into Rescue 1, he could be doing so as our president.\n\nBut even if that is so, the firefighters will likely judge him less by his politics than by whether he still looks them in the eye and listens to what they have to say, whether he still lives up to the word that will continue to make him Joe Biden, no matter how an election goes.\n\nMaybe call him Genuine Joe.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:29.972+0000"}
{"entityId": 1656, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Millennials\u2014rich or otherwise\u2014have been notoriously uninterested in politics. So how do you mobilize a cynical generation?\n\nWhether it is entertainment, consumer goods, or almost anything else that can be purchased, viewed, or clicked on, millennials are the most coveted demographic. There are about 80 million Americans between the ages of 18-34 and next year they are expected to spend $2.45 trillion.\n\nBut when it comes to politics and national policy, they have relatively little clout because most of them don\u2019t reliably vote and aren\u2019t major political contributors. These young adults have voluntarily checked out of a political system they consider corrupt and dysfunctional.\n\nLast month, a Gallup poll showed Barack Obama\u2019s standing among white millennials down to 34 percent, the lowest rating of his presidency with this group, which reflects not only the disaffection young Americans have with the president but also with both parties and politics in general.\n\nDespite being the country\u2019s largest adult demographic, the millennial participation rate in the November midterm elections was the worst of any age group. Only about 21 percent of millennials cast a ballot and exit polls showed that voters 30 and younger represented only 13 percent of the electorate. However, in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections they were the largest bloc of voters.\n\nThe unevenness of millennial political participation is driven in part by apathy and by the belief that politics is not the way to solve problems. This feeling has been exacerbated by the political dysfunction in Washington and by their disappointment that Obama has not delivered on his promise to change the political system.\n\nMany of those in attendance were visibly unimpressed by Cruz and some of his comments were met with derisive laughter.\n\nA majority of the millennials who are registered to vote are independents, and only 31 percent say they believe there is much difference between Republicans and Democrats, according to a Pew Research Center survey.\n\n\n\nA recent study by Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics found that 80 percent of young adults do not consider themselves to be politically engaged and only 18 percent said that they believe the way to address important issues is through the political system.\n\nSo how can millennials be mobilized?\n\nTwo groups working on the question are the Millennial Action Project and the Nexus Youth Summit, which partnered recently for a Capitol Hill summit that featured more than half-a-dozen members of Congress who addressed millennial philanthropists and political leaders.\n\nThe gathering featured panels on topics like impact investing, gun safety, women in philanthropy, education reform, and climate change. It focused on the possibility of finding common ground and how the two parties can work together in Congress as well as how millennials can use philanthropy to promote social change.\n\nThe Millennial Action Project (MAP) seeks to engage young people in politics and give them more of a voice in governing. It was behind the organization of the bipartisan Congressional Future Caucus, headed by Hawaii Democrat Tulsi Gabbard and Illinois Republican Aaron Schock, both 33 years old. The caucus is for lawmakers younger than 40\u2014currently there are 40 representatives under 40 years old in the U.S. House but another 20 were elected in November.\n\nNo sitting senator is under 40, but Republicans Tom Cotton of Arkansas, 37, and Cory Gardner of Colorado, 40, both elected in November, will change that next year.\n\nRepublican Elise Stefanik, 30, of upstate New York, just became the youngest woman ever elected to the House of Representatives. But Steven Olikara, the Millennial Action Project\u2019s founder, laments that there is still not a single member of Congress under the age of 30.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis new generation of leaders can make cooperation sexy,\u201d Olikara told me.\n\nThat was certainly the vibe at the summit, which even inspired Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican who pushed for the 2013 government shutdown, to talk about the need for bipartisanship and citizen engagement even as he slammed the Affordable Care Act and the Obama administration\u2019s action on immigration.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis town is corrupt,\u201d Cruz declared. \u201cThe American people need to rise up and hold their elected officials accountable.\u201d\n\nMany of those in attendance were visibly unimpressed by Cruz and some of his comments were met with derisive laughter, but he was given credit for showing up.\n\nA big part of the draw for Cruz may have been the wealthy millennials in attendance, who are participants in the Nexus Youth Summit. Nexus\u2019 membership includes \u201chundreds of the world\u2019s most philanthropic families,\u201d according to Jonah Wittkamper, its co-founder and director.\n\nThe group, which includes members of the Rockefeller, Pritzker, and Marriott families, was hosted at the White House this spring.\n\nIn the not too distant future, these young people will control billions of dollars. Over the next several decades an estimated $30 trillion will transfer through inheritance to millennials and Wittkamper is trying to encourage them to think strategically about philanthropy now.\n\nNexus is not only an American but a worldwide organization and Wittkamper says the group\u2019s showcase event is its annual United Nations summit. He likes to bring diverse people together and attempt to build bridges, for example, between \u201cmembers of Israel\u2019s wealthiest families and Saudi princes.\u201d\n\nAmong millennials, though, it is not just the super-wealthy who believe in charitable giving\u2014 87 percent of those under age 35 gave a financial gift to nonprofits last year.\n\nMany millennials who don\u2019t trust the political system\u2014even the wealthiest\u2014are working outside it to effect change. But Olikara cautioned those attending the congressional summit they can\u2019t just take the attitude that politics is dirty and not worth their trouble.\n\nIn the Harvard study, 33 percent of millennials said they believe members of Congress represent themselves more than anyone else; 27 percent said campaign donors; 25 percent said their party; and only 10 percent said members of Congress prioritize the interests of their constituents.\n\nBut on issues ranging from climate change to the national debt, education and entitlement reform, Olikara says millennials will be disproportionately burdened in the future by congressional inaction now\u2014so they had better get involved.\n\n\u201cIf you care about policy, you have to care about politics. If you want to make a difference on a big scale, you\u2019ve got to get involved in politics and government.\u201d\n\nLegend says bank robber Willie Sutton was asked why he robbed banks, he reportedly answered \u201cbecause that\u2019s where the money is.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the same thing for the political system\u2014it\u2019s where the big money and power is centered.

That starts at the top of the campaign,\u201d said Aimee Allison, senior VP at PowerPAC+.\n\nTwo other senior pollsters: John Anzalone and David Binder.\n\nOne operative quipped that the top levels of the campaign are in danger of looking like \u201cwhite dudefest 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Hillary doesn\u2019t begin hiring well-respected African-American or Hispanic political aides in top positions,\u201d said a senior African American Congressional aide, \u201cI would imagine that people will really start to wonder if she is serious about covering her left flank. If that is the case they will look for a candidate who is eager to demonstrate that senior level inclusiveness is a high priority.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s staff is only going to make diversity a factor in hiring \u201cif they feel pressure on it,\u201d said a Democratic strategist.\n\nThis is not to say Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t been seeking any counsel from women or minorities. She is close to Maggie Williams, who became her campaign manager in 2008. Cheryl Mills, her former chief of staff at the State Department, is expected to be involved on some level in the campaign. Longtime aide Huma Abedin remains a trusted advisor.\n\nAnd political staffers Marlon Marshall and Brynne Craig are also expected to join any future Clinton campaign.\n\nBut as it stands, white men dominate her inner circle\u2014or at least leaks about her inner circle.\n\nAsked if Hillary Clinton was committed to empowering a diverse circle of advisors as she contemplates a presidential run, aide Nick Merrill responded, \u201calways has, always will.\u201d\n\nSeveral Democrats defended Clinton, telling The Daily Beast on the record that it was premature to judge the makeup Clinton\u2019s staff at this early stage of the election cycle. They also pointed out Clinton\u2019s long history of hiring women and minorities for critical roles on her staff.\n\nBut then, off the record, they said diversity in her campaign was absolutely something they were concerned about, and was an issue being deliberated behind the scenes by major donors and party leaders.\n\nThe Democrats who spoke to The Daily Beast didn\u2019t want to be named for a variety of reasons: some were trying to land campaign positions in the 2016 election cycle, or their bosses are expected to support Hillary, or they feared retribution and wanted to speak freely.\n\nThe frustrations over racial and gender diversity are especially acute among those staffers who worked on the most recent Obama campaign. Many of them found that women and minority staffers were not elevated to the very top rungs of the campaign structure\u2014nor did they receive nearly enough credit for its eventual success.\n\nOne post-campaign retrospective from Rolling Stone drew particular ire\u2014it pointed out ten of the Obama campaign\u2019s \u2018real heroes,\u2019 nine of whom were men.\n\nThe question of diversity Clinton could face was handled improperly by Obama in the last election cycle, said a strategist who worked on the president\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cOn these historic campaigns, where you\u2019re trying to change the very image of what the word \u2018president\u2019 evokes, what you think of when you think of the word \u2018president,\u2019 the leadership was pretty male, pretty white,\u201d she said.\n\nThe issue of hiring diverse staff matters especially for Democrats because women and minorities make up a disproportionately large proportion of their electoral coalition.\n\nVoters of color make up some 40 percent of the Democratic base, Allison said. But PowerPAC+ had previously found that less than two percent of the money the Democratic Party spent on consultants over the past two election cycles went to firms with minority ownership.\n\nAnd a study by the New Organizing Institute, a progressive group, found that Democrats pay black staffers 30 perecent less than their white counterparts.\n\n\u201cThere is a real glass ceiling to what positions people who look like me or come from where I\u2019m from could have gained within that network.

{"entityId": 1660, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "A new kind of politics is being born in the discussion over race and militarized policing in Ferguson.\n\nJust two weeks ago, The New York Times Magazine had the temerity to ask, \u201cHas the Libertarian Moment Finally Arrived?\u201d Among the evidence that America is becoming more socially tolerant, fiscally responsible, and interested in shaking things up: rapid increases in the acceptance of gay marriage, pot legalization, and other forms of self-expression; wariness toward our bipartisan interventionist foreign policy; widespread outrage at governmental invasions of privacy; continued antipathy toward Obamacare and declining approval ratings of Congress; and a general lack of belief that spending more money is going to fix the country anytime soon.\n\nThe usual grab bag of pundits invested in the political status quo was quick to dismiss the question. Of course there\u2019s no libertarian moment, huffed Democratic and Republican partisans. Yet if you want more evidence that a libertarian moment is gathering in contemporary America\u2014and that it is fundamentally a pre-political, pre-partisan impulse with the potential to seriously alter existing conversations and coalitions\u2014look no further than Ferguson, Missouri, where a tragically delayed discussion about police militarization and race that has finally captured the public imagination.\n\nIn small towns and big cities alike, African Americans have long complained about having to deal with (predominantly white) cops who sometimes act like occupying armies. Sadly, there\u2019s nothing particularly unique about the August 9 death of Michael Brown at the hands of police. Police kill unarmed people\u2014especially unarmed black men\u2014all the time, and it usually doesn\u2019t touch off a wide-ranging national discussion about much of anything. For instance, how many Americans have heard about John Crawford III, who was shot and killed by police after picking up a toy gun in a Wal-Mart earlier this month?\n\nOne of the reasons Ferguson is different is because of the spectacularly ham-fisted response by local law enforcement when faced with protests after a highly questionable death. It goes without saying that there is still much to be learned about the circumstances of Brown\u2019s shooting and the events surrounding it, all of which may exonerate the police. However, there\u2019s no question that local authorities helped to massively escalate a tense situation with every decision they made, from refusing at first to name the officer involved in the shooting, to confronting peaceful demonstrators with weapons of war, to releasing a videotape of Brown apparently robbing a convenience store the day he was shot.\n\nWhat has helped the story to go fully national, however, is that the events surrounding it exemplify the concerns that libertarians have been raising for decades about the militarization of police, which has its roots both in the drug war and the post-9/11 terror-industrial complex. As my former colleague Radley Balko, now at The Washington Post, has documented for years (first at The Cato Institute, then at Reason, and most fully in last year\u2019s Rise of the Warrior Cop), \u201cThe buzz phrase in policing today is officer safety. You\u2019ll also hear lots of references to preserving order, and fighting wars, be it on crime, drugs, or terrorism. Those are all concepts that emphasize confrontation. It\u2019s a view that pits the officers as the enforcer, and the public as the entity upon which laws and policies and procedures are to be enforced.\u201d\n\nBalko is just one of many libertarians who worked to highlight these issues long before Ferguson erupted. \u201cDress like a soldier and you think you\u2019re at war,\u201d Glenn Reynolds, a law professor at University of Tennessee and the proprietor of the massively influential libertarian aggregator site Instapundit, wrote in 2006. \u201cAnd, in wartime, civil liberties\u2014or possible innocence\u2014of the people on \u2018the other side\u2019 don\u2019t come up much. But the police aren\u2019t at war with the citizens they serve, or at least they\u2019re not supposed to be.\u201d\n\nIn Ferguson, minority outrage at police mistreatment has intersected with the libertarian critique of state power in a way that has brought the concerns of both groups to a national audience.\n\nAt the same time that libertarians have been archly critical of the Pentagon and other federal programs that have shipped surplus war gear to local police with little training and even less accountability, we\u2019ve also been talking up the revolutionary power of cheap, decentralized technology that allows individual citizens to talk back to power, including by filming the police. \u201cWatched cops are polite cops,\u201d after all, especially now that videos of police brutality can be spread through social media.\n\nIn Ferguson, minority outrage at police mistreatment has intersected with the libertarian critique of state power in a way that has brought the concerns of both groups to a national audience. Most interestingly, the coverage of Ferguson hasn\u2019t been dominated by figures such as Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton. Even a few years ago, they would have been at the forefront of the coverage. Now, the people at the center of this conversation have been journalists on the scene and local community spokespeople.\n\nAnd when it does come to the political class, Rand Paul\u2019s op-ed in Time was far and away the most trenchant (and early) sustained commentary on Ferguson and the issues it raises. \u201cThere is a systemic problem with today\u2019s law enforcement,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury\u2014national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture\u2014we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands. Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.\u201d\n\nIndeed, what Ferguson demonstrates is how tightly related abstract concerns libertarians have about the government\u2019s power and the very real-life fears of police harassment that many African Americans have really are. So too are other issues of interest to both groups, ranging from school choice to sentencing reform to occupational licensing. As these sorts of newly recognized common causes filter through the culture, all sorts of new coalitions and possibilities can come to fruition. Glimpses of this are already visible in actions such as the nearly successful effort by Republican Rep. Justin Amash and Democratic Rep. John Conyers to defund National Security Agency surveillance programs last summer.\n\nThe politics of exhaustion\u2014that desperate attempt to maintain an increasingly dysfunctional and disheartening status quo that is swelling the ranks of independents and driving down political approval ratings to historic lows\u2014is giving way to new sets of conversations that are as urgent as they are overdue. Exactly how those conversations play out, especially in terms of partisan politics, is far less important than the fact they are taking place and moving the country forward to new areas of common ground.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:32.956+0000"}

Dating back to the United States\u2019 founding, France\u2019s friendship was crucial to the nascent nation\u2019s very survival. This shared history makes American politicians\u2019 glaring absence from last weekend\u2019s rally in Paris all the more galling. Yes, on Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry gave France \u201ca hug\u201d along with James Taylor\u2019s performance of \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend,\u201d but the Obama Administration needs to do far more.\n\nThe French aided the United States in our war for liberty; we should we stand beside them now as they defend theirs.\n\n\u201cThe preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the republican model of government,\u201d George Washington wrote in 1789, are \u201cstaked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.\u201d The world still looks to the United States to continue this experiment in republican government. And by not going to Paris, President Obama and our leaders failed the American people by neglecting to stand with France against Islamic extremists\u2019 attacks on one of those sacred liberties: freedom of expression.\n\nThe absence of the president, vice president, and other top officials from the rally sent a dangerous message. It showed the world that the United States\u2019 leaders cannot be counted on to stand up for one of its core beliefs; it indicated that the nation is selective in its support, even for its oldest ally. And if history has taught us anything, it is that messages matter.\n\nDuring the United States\u2019 battle for independence, General George Washington astutely recognized that he could not win the war solely through military tactics. He had to inspire the American people and rest of the world to believe in the righteousness of the patriots\u2019 fight for liberty. Unlike other generals of his day who orchestrated battles from afar, Gen. Washington was at the front lines, courageously risking his life to fight alongside his troops. It was precisely such symbolism that moved the patriots to sacrifice for the liberties we enjoy today. And we need our leaders to continue to be at the front lines of America\u2019s ongoing ideological struggle.\n\nIn 1778, Benjamin Franklin and the American patriots convinced France to join their fight for independence by entering with them into the \u201cTreaty of Alliance and a Treaty of Amity and Commerce.\u201d As the fledgling United States struggled against Britain, the patriots were desperate for French troops, munitions, ships, and funds.\n\n\u201cA freeman, contending for his liberty on his own ground, is superior to any slavish mercenary on earth.\u201d\n\nSure, the French did not aid the American patriots due to any great love of liberty. The French were still governed by their own king, after all. Instead, the French government helped for selfish reasons: they sought to defeat France\u2019s old British foes. The Americans were the enemies of their enemies, as the ancient proverb goes. And in a long, global war that cost thousands of American and French lives and nearly bankrupted both nations, the allies beat the mightiest empire on earth.\n\nYes, America\u2019s relationship with France has had its ups and downs since then: the United States refused to aid the French revolutionaries when they overthrew their own monarch in the 18th century because the Americans deemed them too radical. But that rift was repaired by 1885, when France gave the United States the Statue of Liberty to commemorate the nations\u2019 commitment to liberty. Then during World War I and again in World War II, the United States stood with France in defense of liberty, for which Charles de Gaulle symbolically returned the favor with his very conspicuous presence as our nation grieved following the Kennedy assassination.\n\nThough the two nations\u2019 histories may be mixed and their approaches to free speech somewhat varied, the United States and France\u2019s interests are largely aligned now as we confront another threat to freedom.\n\nOver the past two and half centuries, our mutual foe has transformed from a monarchy to a fundamentalist ideology; but the fight for liberty nevertheless rages on.\n\nSince the Revolutionary War, American republican ideology has spread throughout the globe. The patriots\u2019 triumph soon ignited uprisings in France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, Haiti, and Latin America, and, over time, values such as free expression came to take deeper root, fueled in part by the American example. Over the following centuries, these principles were adopted to varying degrees around the world, helping to lead to a level of liberty the likes of which the earth has never previously enjoyed.\n\nFar from an inevitable progression, the United States\u2019 founding principles were tested and faced ruin numerous times throughout the ages\u2014by the European monarchies, by the fascists, and by the communists. But against each, the ideology of individual liberty triumphed as American troops and their allies fought oppressive regimes.\n\nBut now those principles are threatened again by a competing ideology: militant Islamic extremism. With ISIS being the chief example, people are turning by the thousands towards an ideology of oppression and violence.\n\nIdeological wars are not won by guns alone. They are won by ideas. That\u2019s why the president missed a critical opportunity last weekend to reaffirm the nation\u2019s support for one of our most fundamental ideals: freedom of expression. As Gen. Washington put it, if \u201cthe freedom of Speech may be taken away,\u2026 dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter.\u201d\n\nIt is time for the nation\u2019s leadership to unequivocally demonstrate America\u2019s commitment to our core principles. Through words and actions the president must galvanize the American people and the world to defend freedom of expression. He needs to go to the front lines, which currently include Paris, and as Gen. Washington phrased it, \u201cshow the whole world that a freeman, contending for his liberty on his own ground, is superior to any slavish mercenary on earth.\u201d Gen. Washington understood that America\u2019s enemies only respond to forceful resolve.\n\nIf President Obama does not visibly stand up for American principles of liberty alongside the nation\u2019s allies, we will lose ground to latest threat to the continuing American experiment\u2014and that \u201csacred fire of liberty\u201d will darken.\n\nLogan Beirne is an ISP Fellow at Yale Law School and the author of Blood of Tyrants: George Washington & the Forging of the Presidency.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:33.207+0000"}

The folks at The New York Times\u2019 The Upshot are saying it could be a tie. But Sam Wang of Princeton stands almost alone in forecasting that the Democrats will just barely hold their Senate majority.\n\nWang says he thinks the Democrats have a 70 percent chance of holding control of the Senate. As of Monday afternoon, Nate Silver thinks the Republicans have a 58 percent chance of winning, and The Upshot gives Republicans a 52 percent chance now calling it a tossup.\n\n\n\nWang is a 47-year-old professor of neuroscience and molecular biology at Princeton who uses advanced statistical methods to study how brain circuits work. He is the author of two books on the brain and his recent work focuses on autism. Politics, he says, is just kind of a hobby. \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively easy problem compared with the other things I do,\u201d he told me.\n\nHe started dabbling in politics in 2004 when he devised a computer program to aggregate and analyze polling data on the presidential race and in 2008 he founded the Princeton Election Consortium, a webpage featuring his modeling and blogs.\n\nIn 2012, his statistical analysis correctly predicted the presidential vote in 49 of 50 states and all 10 competitive Senate races including Montana and North Dakota\u2014which, he likes to point out, Nate Silver got wrong.\n\nA bit of a rivalry has developed between the two men. Wang refers to Silver as \u201cthe king of the nerds,\u201d and while it may take one to know one, Silver seems a little irritated by Wang encroaching on his turf. He has dissed Wang\u2019s Senate call and in a recent appearance on WNYC said Wang uses \u201carbitrary assumptions,\u201d which Wang calls \u201can out-and-out falsehood.\u201d\n\nSilver also said he \u201cwould like to place a large wager against that guy,\u201d not even bothering to mention Wang by name\u2014reminiscent of the \u201cI did not have sex with that woman\u201d sort of dismissal.\n\nWang\u2019s response: he was more accurate than Silver in 2012 and wants to \u201clet the math do the talking.\u201d If Silver turns out to be wrong about this election Wang told me Silver \u201ccan eat a bug.\u201d\n\nSilver said he would like to wager Wang on the election\u2019s outcome. Wang\u2019s response: If Silver turns out to be wrong about the election he \u201ccan eat a bug.\u201d\n\nAs Brian Lehrer of WNYC said on his show Friday\u2014\u201cMath Fight!!!\u201d\n\nWhat Wang does differently than Silver and other prognosticators is base his analysis only on the polling data for each Senate race. Everyone else uses other factors including their own judgment to try to enhance the accuracy of their predictions including things like Barack Obama\u2019s popularity in different states, economic indicators, Democratic and Republican favorability, and turnout predictions.\n\nWang\u2019s model uses an 80-line meta-analysis program he designed that takes all of the available polls and aggregates them to get a statistical snapshot of what is happening.\n\nAlthough not every poll is reliable, Wang says even though individual pollsters can have biases and make mistakes, if you add all of the polls together they are very good at predicting outcomes.\n\n\u201cLet the statistics do their job and get out of their way and don\u2019t put a finger on the scale,\u201d says Wang in describing his method.\n\nAnd this year, says Wang, those polls right now are telling him that the Democrats are going to emerge from the election with a 50-seat majority, for a net loss of five. Since Vice President Joe Biden is the Senate\u2019s presiding officer and tie-breaking vote, the Democrats only have to win 50 seats to retain control while the Republicans have to win 51.\n\nThe top seven races\u2014North Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, Iowa, Arkansas, Alaska, and Kansas are all within two points right now, Wang says. He predicts Republicans will win four of those: Dan Sullivan defeating Sen. Mark Begich in Alaska; Tom Cotton beating Sen. Mark Pryor in Arkansas; Sen. Mary Landrieu losing to Bill Cassidy in Louisiana, and David Perdue beating Michelle Nunn in the open Georgia seat.\n\nWang and the others are also in agreement that Democrats will hold their seats in Iowa, where Democrat Bruce Braley is running in an open seat race against Joni Ernst, and that Sen. Kay Hagan will beat Thom Tillis in North Carolina.\n\nThere is also unanimity so far among Wang and his fellow handicappers about what is happening in the Colorado, New Hampshire, Kentucky, and Michigan races. Incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado is expected to hold his seat. And despite all of the national media attention former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown has gotten by moving to New Hampshire and winning the Republican nomination there, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen currently leads that race.\n\nWang and the others believe Democrat Gary Peters will win in Michigan, keeping that seat in the Democratic column, and that Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who wants to change his title from minority to majority leader, is safe for reelection.\n\n\n\nThe other two states that aren\u2019t really in play but involve Republican gains are South Dakota and Montana.\n\nKansas is the race where Wang differs in his prediction from Five Thirty Eight, The Upshot and others and on which his call about control of the Senate depends. Wang was onto this one before most others. He\u2019s been doing political analysis for The New Yorker online this year, and in late August, he wrote that he thought control of the Senate could hinge on the candidacy of Kansas Independent Greg Orman, who is running against longtime GOP Senator Pat Roberts.\n\nThat assessment was based on a Public Policy Polling report that showed Orman leading Roberts by 10 points in a head-to-head matchup. Wang pointed out that Roberts\u2019 approval rating was lower than Barack Obama\u2019s in Kansas and suggested if Democrat Chad Taylor dropped out of the race, which he subsequently did on Sept 3, Orman had a good chance of defeating Roberts.\n\nThe latest Kansas poll shows Orman with a one point lead over Roberts\u2014a virtual tie\u2014with Taylor drawing as much as 10 percent of the vote (the state\u2019s Republican secretary of state ruled that Roberts\u2019 name must stay on the ballot a decision Taylor has appealed to the Kansas Supreme Court).\n\nWang predicts an Orman win, while most other analysts all have Kansas at least leaning Republican.\n\nAdd all the above up, and you get to a 50-50 Democratic advantage. But there\u2019s a catch: The 50 would include those seats held by independent senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, who currently caucus with the Democrats.King said several months ago he would decide after the election whether to switch sides. It would also include Orman, who has declined to say which party he would support if he wins but who has indicated he would join whichever side has the majority. If Republicans only manage to pick up four or five seats, King and Orman could become independent kingmakers and have the power to determine which party controls the Senate.\n\nIt should be noted that Wang has incorrectly forecast Democratic victories before. In 2004, an extremely close presidential race, the polls Wang analyzed showed that George W. Bush would win, but Wang said he second guessed the analysis and tried to factor in the undecided votes, flipping his prediction to a John Kerry victory.\n\nHe vividly remembers Shirley Tilghman, then the president of Princeton, asking for his prediction. Wang told her it would be Kerry. Wang calls the flub \u201ca humbling mistake\u2026Now I don\u2019t shoot off my mouth unless there are numbers involved.\u201d\n\nHe also revealed that he was up for tenure that year and was extremely relieved it didn\u2019t depend on his political forecasting.\n\nAnother prediction he got wrong involved the 2012 congressional election. In September of that year, Wang said he thought Democrats could win back control of the House of Representatives. Wang explains he made the mistake because at first he didn\u2019t realize how significant Republican structural advantages were after redistricting. \u201cI backtracked on that pretty soon thereafter. This is better than sticking with a wrong analysis,\u201d he says.\n\nDespite his intellectual firepower, Wang, who uses phrases like topsy-turvy and describes himself as a \u201cpolitically inclined quantitative nerd,\u201d is modest, self-effacing, and unfailingly polite. When sending a message from his phone the signature reads \u201cSent by handheld. Excuse brevity please!\u201d\n\nThe son of Taiwanese immigrants, he grew up in California and earned his PhD in neuroscience at Stanford. He is the co-author of two best-selling books\u2014\u201cWelcome To Your Brain: Why You Lose Your Car Keys But Never Forget How To Drive\u201d and \u201cWelcome To Your Child\u2019s Brain: How The Mind Develops From Conception To College.\u201d\n\nFor this election cycle, Wang has also taken a look at gubernatorial races and has come up with a model to explain why some Republican governors in swing states could have trouble getting reelected. Those governors who stalled or blocked implementation of the Affordable Care Act are the ones Wang thinks are in the most trouble, including Scott Walker in Wisconsin, Sam Brownback in Kansas, Tom Corbett in Pennsylvania, and Paul LePage in Maine.\n\nWang thinks Medicaid expansion is a \u201cproxy variable\u201d that is predictive of extreme conservative stands on other issues as well that have hurt those governors. He points out that Republican governors in Michigan, Ohio, and New Mexico who accepted Obamacare and Medicaid expansion look to be in pretty good shape for reelection, although Michigan is close.\n\n\u201cI think no statistical model is perfect,\u201d says Jennifer Duffy who follows Senate and governor\u2019s races for the Cook Political Report. \u201cThere are subjective factors that can\u2019t be factored in.\u201d\n\nIf the polls were to move 1 to 2 points in the Republican direction the outcome could certainly be different but Wang says things have changed surprisingly little since June. \u201cDemocrats are outperforming expectations.\u201d Wang says he is comfortable standing by his predictions but, ever the statistician, acknowledges: \u201cI have a 30 percent chance of being wrong.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:33.499+0000"}

Barack Obama entered the stratosphere with his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, but eventually became just another polarizing politician. And when Scott Brown won the 2010 Massachusetts special election for Senate, he spent a brief moment as a post-partisan dreamboat before eventually turning into just another political hack in a barn jacket.\n\nBut, for Monica Wehby, the Republican candidate for Senate in Oregon, her moment of glory didn\u2019t even last a month. Wehby shot to success with a campaign ad at the end of the primary on May 20 that promoted her background as a career a pediatric neurosurgeon. But, in the run up to the vote, her campaign got into trouble when it was revealed that an ex-boyfriend had filed a police report against her calling Wehby \u201ca stalker.\u201d (Ironically, that ex-boyfriend, Andrew Miller, had also funded a superPAC on Wehby\u2019s behalf which spent six figures attacking one of her GOP primary opponents.\n\nThe news of the police report, which broke four days before primary day, didn\u2019t hurt Wehby in her quest for the GOP nomination \u2014 all votes are cast by mail in Oregon so it\u2019s likely few voters could have been swayed. Instead, it left the candidate scrambling and her campaign flat footed. Instead of taking a victory lap, she was was dodging reporters. But while Wehby has since sunk in the polls and fallen well behind first-term Democratic incumbent Jeff Merkley, it doesn\u2019t mean the race is over yet, even in a state as blue as Oregon.\n\nWehby\u2019s race matters because in 2014, the key electoral battle is over control of the U.S. Senate. Republicans are hoping to pick up the six seats necessary to make Mitch McConnell majority leader and exercise veto power over the Obama administration's ability to appoint judges and officials. The goal for Republicans is to expand the battlefield as wide as possible to blue states like Oregon and stretch Democrats thin in the hope of beating enough incumbents to achieve their goal.\n\nOregon will always be an uphill battle for the GOP in the near future.\n\nFreedom Partners, an Arlington, Va.-based group affiliated with the Koch Brothers, is set to drop $3.6 million dollars in the race on her behalf against Merkley. \u201cOregonians deserve effective leadership and Freedom Partners will continue to hold Sen. Merkley accountable for his bad votes on issues like Obamacare, and his ineffective record,\u201d said James Davis, a spokesman for the group. But Freedom Partners\u2019 decision to enter the fray is not just about animus towards Merkley, who is simultaneously one of the more liberal and more obscure members of the Democratic caucus in the Senate. Instead, there\u2019s a hope that Wehby might actually win, albeit with difficulty.\n\nOne national GOP strategist described the race as one that has always been viewed \u201cas a bit of an uphill climb\u201d that could break their way with \u201cthe right candidate and the right circumstances.\u201d And part of the right circumstances may be a big investment by an outside group like Freedom Partners. Justin Barasky, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told The Daily Beast, \u201cclearly, the only chance Monica Wehby would have of making the race competitive would be if the Kochs were going to dump millions of dollars into the race and they must be trying it out to see if they can do that.\u201d\n\nMoney alone can\u2019t help a Republican win a race in a deep blue state, however, as failed GOP candidates like Linda McMahon and Carly Fiorina can attest. Instead, Republicans like Art Robinson, the chair of the Oregon Republican Party, say that Wehby\u2019s biography will help carry the day. Robinson says that if Wehby runs a strong campaign, she has \u201can excellent chance\u201d of winning. Her biography as someone \u201cwho succeeded in life at something difficult\u201d should sell well with voters, he added.\n\nNor are campaigns just about biography. There are issues and positions taken, too. While Robinson says Wehby isn\u2019t \u201csuper conservative\u201d and describes her \u201cas moderate enough to please the liberal wing\u201d of the Oregon GOP. National Republicans see her in the mold of moderates like Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, but Democrats disagree. They harp on her opposition to equal pay legislation and support for conservative legislation that would slash the budget like Tea Party-backed \u201ccut, cap and balance\u201d bill. This bill, which passed the House but failed in the Senate, would have cut federal spending, capped future spending at a percentage of GDP and encouraged a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n\nOregon will always be an uphill battle for the GOP in the near future. While strong in rural areas, Oregon Republicans have struggled to win statewide races for 20 years, according to the Associated Press, and Democrats have an 8-point advantage in voter registration. And the most beloved Republican politician is the late Mark Hatfield, a former senator best known for his opposition to the Vietnam War and decisive vote against the Balanced Budget Amendment, positions that would put him solidly in the liberals\u2019 camp today. But in a year where Republicans have their best chance to regain control of the Senate since 2006, betting the Koch\u2019s money on Wehby may be worth a gamble.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:33.988+0000"}

Steve Scalise, R-La., said on Fox News Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe president last November did something that 22 times before he said he wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said on CNN.\n\n\u201cThe president said 22 times, 22 times, that he couldn\u2019t do what he eventually did,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation.\n\nAre Boehner and others right?\n\nTurns out the number is a bit of a stretch, but the broader point by Boehner and the rest is accurate. We rate Boehner\u2019s claim Mostly True.\n\nThe source for Boehner\u2019s claim is Boehner himself. After Obama\u2019s post-midterm elections announcement to delay deportations of unauthorized immigrants who have lived in the country for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards, Boehner\u2019s office created a BuzzFeed-style blog post detailing \u201c22 Times President Obama Said He Couldn\u2019t Ignore or Create His Own Immigration Law.\u201d\n\nIn a nutshell, the majority of the examples are of Obama saying he did not have power to do more on immigration without Congress.\n\nFor example, Obama was asked in September 2012 if he would issue an executive action delaying deportation for non-criminal immigrants such as the parents of U.S.-born children. Obama replied that \u201cas the head of the executive branch, there\u2019s a limit to what I can do\u2026 we\u2019re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally,\u201d as in parents being deported.\n\nThe following January, Obama was asked why he couldn\u2019t protect mothers living here without authorization from deportation as he had served law-abiding students. \u201cI\u2019m not a king,\u201d he said.\n\nBut other statements on Boehner\u2019s list say something else or aren\u2019t specific to immigration.\n\nIn two instances during his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama criticized \u201csigning statements\u201d used by President George W. Bush that interpret laws, but he did not bring up immigration. Immigration was also not part of his reply to a question at a 2010 MTV/BET event when he said, \u201cI can\u2019t simply ignore laws that are out there,\u201d in response to a question about \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d\n\nBoehner\u2019s broader point\u2014that Obama said one thing about executive action but did another\u2014is accurate. But he should refrain from the rhetorical flourish of saying Obama said it 22 times.\n\nLater in his interview with CBS\u2019 John Dickerson, Boehner alleged other examples of executive overreach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the president of the United States overreaching, and that\u2019s just not on immigration,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cYou know 38 times he made unilateral changes to Obamacare. Many of these, I believe, far beyond his constitutional authority to do so.\u201d\n\nOn this number\u201438\u2014Boehner\u2019s claim rates Half True.\n\nBoehner\u2019s staff pointed us to the Galen Institute, a think tank that promotes free-market principles in health care. A Feb. 25 article lists 48 changes to the Affordable Care Act, but only 29 changes were made by the Obama administration.\n\nGalen Institute President Grace-Marie Turner told PolitiFact that the think tank will soon update its unilateral action count to 30, with the administration\u2019s recent decision to reduce cost-sharing. The law originally called for out-of-pocket maximums to be lowered for those between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, but the administration changed this provision to only apply to those between 100 and 250 percent of the poverty level.\n\nShe added that the administration repeated three of the unilateral actions, which would hypothetically bring the count up to 33.\n\nAnd an August 2014 report out of the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan government program, included five additional examples. All of these combined adds up to 38, Turner said.\n\nBut many of the changes are routine, non-controversial and technical in nature, experts told us.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, there have been 12 significant \u201cdelays, extensions\u201d or \u201cother actions taken by the administration.\u201d\n\nThe report says that the most controversial action has been the 2013 decision to delay enforcement of the employer mandate\u2014the requirement that employers with 50 or more employees must offer full-time workers affordable health insurance or pay a penalty\u2014to 2015.\n\nOf Galen\u2019s more comprehensive list, most are technical changes, rather than policy changes, said James Thurber, director of American University\u2019s Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies.\n\n\u201cMost are insignificant administrative actions by [Health and Human Services],\u201d Thurber wrote in an email to PolitiFact. \u201cThis is common under all presidents.\u201d\n\nLauren Carroll contributed to this report.

{"entityId": 1665, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The answer might define the future of the American left, which has split over race, party politics, and the power of protest since BLM activists targeted Bernie Sanders.\n\nLast Saturday, for the second time in a month, protesters who identified themselves as members of the Black Lives Matter movement leapt onstage to interrupt a speech by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cI was going to tell Bernie how racist this city is, even with all of these progressives, but you\u2019ve already done that for me,\u201d said Marissa Johnson, who was roundly booed before demanding and receiving a four-minute moment of silence for the death of Michael Brown, as Sanders stood behind her and fellow protester Mara Willaford.\n\nThe Seattle protest sparked a particularly strong counter-reaction, especially among the white liberals who form the core of Bernie Sanders\u2019s base. Sanders is not the front-runner to win his party\u2019s nomination. Many on both the left and right are asking: Why him?\n\nSanders currently trails Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, whose events have not yet been successfully interrupted, by 38 points in Quinnipiac\u2019s most recent national poll. He has made criminal justice reform a tentpole issue early in his campaign. Jeb Bush, who trails Republican front-runner Donald Trump by 10 points, allegedly reached out to local Black Lives Matter leaders a night before, then was shouted down at a campaign event less than 24 hours later.\n\nWhy protest Bernie and not Hillary? Why Jeb and not Trump?\n\nInterviews with 10 members of both local and national branches of Black Lives Matter\u2014as well as with the political campaigns they\u2019ve tested\u2014reveals no single, easy answer. It\u2019s one part logistical\u2014from the less stringent security of a second-tier candidate to the simple timing of a speech.\n\nAnd it is another part\u2014a larger part\u2014purely organizational.\n\nIn response to the death of unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin and the acquittal of his killer, activists Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi rallied together on Twitter to create visibility with a unified phrase: Black Lives Matter. As more black Americans \u2014like Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Freddie Gray\u2014were killed by police, the phrase gained prominence and resonance\u2014both on Twitter, and in the protests that would follow, nationwide.\n\n\n\nIn the process of trying to grow its message from a hashtag spawned by three activists into a national political movement, Black Lives Matter\u2014a decentralized organization with official and unofficial Facebook pages, meet-ups, and blogs throughout America and the world\u2014is splintering internally on how to express that message, and even defining what that message truly is.\n\nAfter all, when an article says Black Lives Matter interrupted a campaign event, who is a part of Black Lives Matter, anyway? The answer to that question is even harder to answer.\n\nThe answer to that question might be a small group of people who self-identify as a \u201cradical organization.\u201d The answer to that question might also be anyone.\n\nAnd the answer to that question might define the future of the American left, which has split over race, party politics, and the limits and powers of protesting since two activists took over a podium in Seattle seven days ago.\n\n***\n\nNikki Stephens, 16, was hit with a barrage of Facebook messages and texts on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cMy phone was blowing up,\u201d Stephens says. \u201cEveryone automatically assumed I was one of the two women\u201d\u2014the protesters who took over the Sanders event in Seattle.\n\nStephens, a high schooler and track athlete, had the keys to the \u201cBlack Lives Matter: Seattle\u201d Facebook page. She had \u201cwatched the video from all angles\u201d of Johnson and Willaford, and now\u2014as the de facto voice of Black Lives Matter: Seattle, she believed\u2014it was her turn to speak.\n\nShe had been drawn into the movement months ago by an activist who came to her school and compelled her to take action on the recent spate of young black men killed by police.\n\n\u201cI wanted to raise awareness\u2014that this is not a joke. That people are actually dying,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made the page.\u201d\n\nWith the help and guidance of her friend, she started sharing stories of injustice and dispatches from the national chapter. Quickly, her page grew to be the largest Black Lives Matter page in Seattle.\n\nElaine Thompson/AP\n\nThen Johnson and Willaford, whom Stephens had never met, took over the podium at the Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign event last weekend.\n\n\u201cI felt like I had to come up with a response,\u201d she says.\n\nThere was, however, a problem: Stephens is a Bernie Sanders supporter. Panicked, she called her friend who had gotten her into the movement to plan her next move.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018What should I do? I don\u2019t really know what to do,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nAs the night progressed, she started receiving messages filled with hate, threats, and racial slurs\u2014especially, she says, from Bernie Sanders fans. They all wanted an apology\u2014one for something she didn\u2019t do.\n\nSo she crafted one.\n\n\u201cTo the people of Seattle and \u202a#\u200eBernieSanders\u202c I am so sorry for what happened today in Seattle. I am a volunteer who just runs this page and I am only just starting to get into the movement,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was unaware of what happened and now that I\u2019ve seen the video [of the event] I would like to say again that I am sorry. That is not what Black Lives Matter stands for and that is not what we\u2019re about. Do not let your faith in the movement be shaken by voices of two people. Please do not question our legitimacy as a movement. Again I would like to apologize to the people of Seattle and I will be trying to reach out to Mr. Sanders.\u201d\n\nSome in the national media ran with it. \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 had apologized.\n\nThat\u2019s when Stephens received messages from both Marissa Johnson and Mara Willaford.\n\n\u201cOf course, you can\u2019t tell tone by text. But when they approached me, through texting, it felt sort of aggressive,\u201d says Stephens. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t like they were mad. They were like, \u2018Who are you? Why\u2019d you start your page?\u2019\u201d\n\nThey told Stephens to change the name of her page\u2014that she had no claim to Black Lives Matter: Seattle.\n\nHowever, Willaford, 25, and Johnson, 23, had not been public leaders of any Black Lives Matter: Seattle pages up until the day of the event.\n\nAt 5:45 a.m. on Saturday, Johnson and Willaford created a separate Facebook page, also, confusingly enough, called \u201cBlack Lives Matter Seattle.\u201d At 6:35 p.m., they issued a press release\u2014the page\u2019s first post\u2014called \u201cBlack Lives Matter #BowDownBernie Action\u201d that listed Johnson as a press contact and was signed by both Johnson and Willaford.\n\nAt the bottom of the note, they are listed as \u201cBlack Lives Matter Seattle co-founders.\u201d\n\nJohnson and Willaford were previously leaders of the group Outside Agitators 206, an activist coalition based in Seattle. According to OA206\u2019s website, the fourth of the organization\u2019s four points of unity is this:\n\nJason Kempin/BET via Getty\n\n\u201cFuck the police: As an institution fundamentally rooted in white supremacy and anti-Blackness we reject the police presence in our communities, absolutely. It is our responsibility to hold each other accountable and keep each other safe.\u201d\n\nThe organization appeared largely dormant over the last several months. According to its website, the group\u2019s sole activity in July was the reposting of a Movement for Black Lives event invitation and an article from TheRoot.com.\n\nAfter the event, Stephens\u2014thinking she had accidentally claimed a page that wasn\u2019t her own and facing mounting pressure\u2014ceded the name of the page. She changed the name to \u201cBlack in Seattle.\u201d Willaford and Johnson\u2019s page was now the primary Black Lives Matter Seattle group on Facebook.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018We appreciate what you\u2019re doing. We appreciate you trying to be involved,\u2019\u201d she says of the texts. \u201c\u2018But it\u2019s not an official message. We\u2019ve gotten calls from the national people at Black Lives Matter.\u2019\u201d\n\nThen, later on, another Facebook group claiming to be a part of Black Lives Matter instead demanded Bernie Sanders and his Seattle-based organizers apologize to the movement. Some national media reported that as a Black Lives Matter response, as well.\n\nThe national Black Lives Matter Facebook page then posted a statement at 2:15 a.m. Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe \u202a#\u200eBlackLivesMatter\u202c organization did not create any petitions demanding apology from Seattle based organizers. We have not issued a public apology, neither have we made any public statements demanding an apology.\u201d\n\nSo who is Black Lives Matter in this situation? Did the movement send protesters to disrupt Bernie Sanders?\n\n\u201cThe point of disruption is to challenge business as usual, to really challenge the community of Seattle\u2014largely white liberals\u2014and their inability to see anti-black racism.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t. My chapter did,\u201d says Patrisse Cullors\u2014one of three people credited with starting and spreading the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag that was used to help grow a national movement. She\u2019s also the founder of Dignity and Power Now, a Los Angeles-based organization that works for the rights of incarcerated people and their families. \u201cWhat we do is we support the chapters. We support their local demands and goals. They tell us what they need us to build support around.\u201d\n\nCullors, 32, says she met up with Willaford at a Black Lives Matter national retreat and that they \u201ctalk all of the time,\u201d but she never gave direct instructions to interrupt Sanders\u2019s rally. She calls Willaford and Johnson\u2019s branch \u201ca very new chapter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat chapter did all the work. And we supported it by ensuring they were a part of the chapter,\u201d says Cullors. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare there\u2019s a national directive for people to do things. We amplify and support.\u201d\n\nBut what about the leader of the larger Black Lives Matter Facebook group in Seattle\u2014one that existed publicly well before Johnson and Willaford got in front of a podium in Seattle?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure where she was coming from,\u201d says Cullors. \u201cI think what\u2019s important is that folks understand the point of disruption: to challenge business as usual, to really challenge the community of Seattle\u2014largely white liberals\u2014and challenging their inability to see anti-black racism, as a part of a larger pushback against the state.\u201d\n\nDoes she understand why there might be confusion over who has true ownership of the message in Seattle? If Stephens had publicly acted first and not Willaford and Johnson, would she not be in charge?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to answer that question,\u201d says Cullors. \u201cThere is a network called Black Lives Matter, with chapters and local affiliates. It could be very confusing for some to think it\u2019s all the same. There could be some that use our name, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s in alignment with our message.\u201d\n\nCullors says there are now \u201cregistered chapters\u201d of the national Black Lives Matter movement, and cites Boston, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and now Seattle as those who have filled out the necessary paperwork.\n\nBut a list of official chapters does not appear on the official Black Lives Matter website and is not publicly available, according to Cullors. There is no registration form on the official website and no statement noting that local Black Lives Matters groups must sign up with the national branch.\n\nWillaford and Johnson did not respond to repeated requests for comment by phone, email, and social media channels. And Cullors wanted to note that she has no problem with Stephens, herself\u2014in fact, she\u2019d like her to meet with Johnson and Willaford to see how she can help the movement\u2014but she believed the apology to be off-message.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to issue an apology trying to censor black folks,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cAnyone can be a Black Lives Matter activist,\u201d she adds. \u201cThat [statement] wasn\u2019t official.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe Seattle disruption exacerbated a nascent divide on the activist left between black and white progressives.\n\nSome white writers, like Gawker\u2019s Hamilton Nolan, wrote after the event that the Black Lives Matter movement was alienating the candidate that best served the movement\u2019s interests\u2014or, as he titled his post, \u201cDon\u2019t Piss On Your Best Friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany on the left find it hard to come out and say \u2018this was stupid,\u2019 because they support both Bernie Sanders and the Black Lives Matter movement,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat is a misperception of the political landscape. Believing that a small group of angry young protesters did something that was not well thought out need not make you feel guilty or racist; rash and counterproductive things are what young people do.\u201d\n\nAfter criticism about the story surfaced\u2014including a piece in Death+Taxes titled \u201c Bernie Sanders Fans: White Paternalism Ain\u2019t Just for Conservatives \u201d\u2014New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait took up Nolan\u2019s cause.\n\n\u201cBut maybe there is a more important question here than mere tactics,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPerhaps shutting down a political speech is, normatively, wrong.\u201d\n\nIn The New Republic, Jamil Smith took issue with some of the responses by white progressive media after the speech.\n\n\u201cThese are supposed to be the white people who want Black Lives Matter to succeed. These people were willing to throw black people under the bus for the white dude they want to win. That\u2019s the same anti-blackness energy that we\u2019re fighting against.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when are protest tactics designed to make the people whom they are targeting feel more comfortable and less annoyed?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd since when is Sanders, or (Republican presidential candidate Ben) Carson, or any candidate exempt from being pushed?\u201d\n\nHis story\u2019s title signified a rallying cry for what some protesters believe to be a growing fissure at the left end of American politics: \u201cBlack Lives Matters Protesters Are Not The Problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was most shocking to me about the reactions to the Bernie Sanders shutdown was the amount of rage from progressive white people for two African-American women who were standing up for what they believe in. The reaction was gross,\u201d Julius Jones, founder of the Black Lives Matter chapter in Worcester, Massachusetts, tells The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cThese are supposed to be the white people who want Black Lives Matter to succeed. These people were willing to throw black people under the bus for the white dude they want to win. That\u2019s the same anti-blackness energy that we\u2019re fighting against.\u201d\n\nBy late Saturday night, Nikki Stephens, a rising high school junior in Washington state, may have accidentally received the worst and most vocal of that hate\u2014and some of it from fans of the candidate she had already supported.\n\n\u201cI heard from so many people and, although you are liberal and you do support Bernie Sanders\u2014and you do say you support Black Lives Matter\u2014I saw a lot of them come out and say some very nasty things about the movement. There were so many people posting claiming to be liberals, then going back and using slurs, and perpetuating stereotypes. And the sexism I saw from men,\u201d she says, trailing off.\n\n***\n\nProtesters in Massachusetts\u2019 Black Lives Matters chapters say there\u2019s a simple logistical reason Bernie Sanders\u2019s speeches have been interrupted twice\u2014once in Seattle, and once before in Phoenix last month\u2014but Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t yet been disrupted.\n\nThat reason? The Secret Service, which Boston Black Lives Matter activist Daunasia Yancey describes as \u201c50 men in the building who are willing to kill you.\u201d\n\nNeither Bernie Sanders nor Jeb Bush has those protective details. Hillary Clinton most certainly does.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not to be pressed in any way. The Secret Service are very dangerous people, and their operation is protect their asset at all costs,\u201d said Jones, who was part of a group of activists who spoke to\u2014instead of protesting against\u2014Hillary Clinton last weekend in New Hampshire. \u201cTo be confronting an issue such as police brutality\u2014and then to tell that same group of people that they should go charge at the [former] first lady\u2014is a little shortsighted.\u201d\n\nYancey, 22, views Black Lives Matter as a \u201cradical\u201d group. But she says that rushing the stage with the intention of taking over the microphone at a Hillary Clinton campaign event is not viable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a radical organization, with radical politics, and we have radical tactics. There\u2019s no way of softening that. But we are strategic, and we\u2019re interested in remaining safe and alive. Something like storming the stage was not a possibility with the Secret Service [present],\u201d Yancey says.\n\nAccording to New England-area Black Lives Matter activists like Yancey and Jones, they came to demonstrate at Clinton\u2019s New Hampshire event last weekend\u2014only to be offered a private meeting with the Democratic front-runner herself.\n\nBut the Clinton campaign has a slightly different story to tell about the night the former Secretary of State met with local Black Lives Matter reps. The campaign contends that the Black Lives Matter activists arrived late to the event and were unable to enter because the room was at capacity.\n\n\u201cThere were another 15 people who also came late and couldn\u2019t get in, so they all were taken to an overflow room. Our team on the ground offered to essentially swap some people out so that they could go into the town hall with Hillary but they declined and asked to meet with her after the event. She met with them for about 15 minutes after the event,\u201d a Clinton spokesperson tells The Daily Beast.\n\nSome activists for criminal justice reform, like Families Against Mandatory Minimums strategic initiatives director Kevin Ring, believe that Clinton is the candidate who deserves the most scrutiny for her previous stances on mass incarceration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on her, more than others, to explain what precisely she got wrong, and what the country got wrong\u2014and what she would do to reverse that,\u201d Ring says.\n\nIn 1994, as the House and Senate were considering whether to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, Clinton said (PDF), \u201cWe need more police, we need more and tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders. The \u2018three-strikes-and-you\u2019re-out\u2019 for violent offenders has to be part of the plan. We need more prisons to keep violent offenders for as long as it takes to keep them off the streets.\u201d\n\nAs a senator running for the presidency, she opposed making shorter sentences for crack cocaine-related offenses retroactive for previously-convicted inmates, even though many advocates had called the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences unjust.\n\nBoth Bill and Hillary Clinton have backed away from the tough-on-crime reforms they championed in the mid-\u201990s. But, advocates say, since Hillary Clinton was involved in creating a climate of mass incarceration that disproportionately targets black Americans, she has a greater responsibility to address why and how her stances about the criminal justice system have changed.\n\nIn their private meeting with Hillary Clinton, members of the Black Lives Matter movement challenged her to reflect on \u201cher personal involvement in the war on drugs and the anti-black policies that were enacted by her family and throughout her career,\u201d Yancey says.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what we heard. We didn\u2019t hear the reaction that we wanted,\u201d Yancey adds.\n\nWhat they heard was talk about policy and legislation. Clinton told them that her previous positions on sentencing were due to a \u201cdifferent climate and a different set of problems\u201d in the \u201990s.\n\nWith the criminal justice reform that was passed in the \u201990s, Jones argues, the \u201cundercurrent of it is anti-blackness. What in her heart has changed\u2026 that will actually change the tide? And how can she use her change to be an example for the United States?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has acknowledged the failure of some of her work. It\u2019s just the next step: the acknowledgement of what\u2019s behind that,\u201d Yancey adds. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s feelings about anti-blackness in our government are very important. She wasn\u2019t willing to go there with us, but it\u2019s a crucial conversation. If you\u2019re looking for solutions to the problem\u2026 [and] there\u2019s a form of white supremacy in your solutions, that\u2019s going to continue.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign contends that their candidate has been reaching out to the Black Lives Matter movement and was paying attention to criminal justice reform and social inequality.\n\n\u201c[O]n an ongoing basis our team has also been reaching out and talking to different parts of the BLM movement as well as a wide range of organizations, activists, stakeholders, etc. so that policy proposals are informed by many voices and experiences,\u201d a Clinton spokesperson tells The Daily Beast. \u201cHillary has been speaking out about Black Lives Matter and criminal justice reform for some time\u2026 it was the subject of her first policy speech of the campaign in April\u2026 in which she laid out specific policy proposals. In addition to criminal justice reform she has also broadened to talk about the opportunity gap and systemic inequities.\u201d\n\nTyrone Brown, a Seattle-based activist who says he \u201cspeaks with Black Lives Matter, but not for Black Lives Matter,\u201d says Bernie Sanders was disrupted at his event on Saturday in part \u201cbecause it was on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Michael Brown\u2019s death.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it had been Clinton, Perry, or whoever\u2014if anybody had come to Seattle, something would have happened that day,\u201d he says. \u201cSomething would\u2019ve had to have happened to highlight it\u2014that tragedy. In this case, it was Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nBrown runs an initiative at Seattle University, where he\u2019s an administrator, called Moral Mondays at SU, which organizes events like talks, discussions, and movie nights as part of a \u201c#BlackLivesMatter initiative.\u201d\n\nBrown met Mara Willaford on the way back to Seattle after the Movement for Black Lives event in Cleveland. He says he now recognizes Willaford and Johnson as the leaders of Black Lives Matter Seattle.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the slight issue with some semantics around timing: How can they take an action before they become an official chapter for the movement? It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says. \u201cIf no one had taken advantage of the fact that the front-runner for the Democratic nomination was speaking in Seattle on that day, somebody was going to take some type of action. They just happened to be the ones that did it.\u201d\n\n***\n\nAlthough she had to hand over the name to her Facebook group, Stephens says she now believes that the protest was ultimately good for the visibility of Bernie Sanders\u2014and that, days after the event, she sees where Willaford and Johnson were coming from.\n\n\u201cWatching social media after it happened, I came to realize what they were doing. A lot of people wrote in saying that it made them want to learn about Bernie Sanders,\u201d she says. \u201cThey inadvertently had done their job\u2014even if that wasn\u2019t their aim.\u201d\n\nStephens hasn\u2019t heard from Johnson or Willaford since she relinquished the name of the page. She said she\u2019d like to continue her activism, but was discouraged by her experience on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cThis really brought out the worst in people,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe have waited and waited and waited. Two more people dead in Ferguson. We can\u2019t take a back seat anymore. I want people to clear their minds of what happened, to stop making it about the women [who interrupted Sanders\u2019s speech]. What did you do? You went looking for more information.\u201d\n\nCorrection 8/15/15 10:12 AM: This piece was updated to better reflect the origins of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:34.912+0000"}
{"entityId": 1666, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Takeaway from White House summit: ISIS and Al Qaeda want us to call them Islamic. It helps them recruit. Is this so hard to understand?\n\nIf you want to help ISIS and al Qaeda, then call them Islamic. That\u2019s one of my big takeaways from this week\u2019s White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism (CVE), which I attended on Wednesday.\n\nSpeakers at the CVE summit, which featured counterterrorism experts, elected officials including the Mayor of Paris, law enforcement, and Muslim leaders, offered a few reasons for this proposition. First, it\u2019s simply inaccurate. As President Obama said as the closing speaker of the day, ISIS and al Qaeda \u201cno more represent Islam than any madman who kills innocents in the name of God represents Christianity or Judaism or Buddhism or Hinduism.\u201d Obama also offered a sentiment very similar to the NRA mantra: Religion doesn\u2019t kill people, people kill people.\n\nI understand that some will dismiss that as political correctness. Well, maybe then these reasons will move those people. As Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) put it at the summit, ISIS wants us to believe its actions are based in Islam because it frames the conflict as a religious war between the West and Islam. This then enables these terror groups to claim they are the defenders of Islam, thus assisting them in raising funds and attracting recruits.\n\nBut there\u2019s another point raised subtly by some, including Obama, and more explicitly by Jordanian counterterrorism expert Suleiman Bakhit, whom I spoke to one on one, that has received little to no coverage in our media. ISIS and al Qaeda not only want people in the Muslim world to think their actions are based on Islam, but they want Westerners to as well. Why? Because they hope that people will retaliate against Muslims living in the West for al Qaeda and ISIS\u2019 actions. If these Muslims are then subject to demonization, hate crimes or worse, the terrorists can tell Muslims: \u201cSee, the West hates Islam! That is why you should join us to fight them.\u201d\n\nBakhit, who was also a participant at the CVE summit, interestingly mentioned the film The Battle of Algiers as instructive in understanding al Qaeda and ISIS. This is the second time an expert has mentioned this film in this context, the first being Rula Jabreal a few weeks ago.\n\nISIS wants us to believe its actions are based in Islam because it frames the conflict as a religious war between the West and Islam.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with this classic 1967 film, it tells the story about Algeria\u2019s fight for independence from France in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Algerian National Liberation front (FLN) engaged in terrorist activities against the French. While FLN leaders knew they could not defeat the French military, they hoped that the French authorities would respond in a brutal and barbaric way against the Algerian population as a whole. Why? Because it would likely stir up more support for the independence movement by the masses of Algerians who were not part of the FLN. And that\u2019s exactly what happened, with Algeria wining its independence a few years later.\n\nISIS and al Qaeda understand they can\u2019t defeat the West militarily, but they can, with as few as two people as we saw with attack on Charlie Hebdo, increase anti-Muslim sentiment across the West. In turn the increased alienation of some in the Muslim community from mainstream society makes it easier to recruit and radicalize.\n\nThat ties into the most common theme heard at the summit, namely that the lure of ISIS and al Qaeda is to offer people on the fringes of society an opportunity to be a part of something. They use social media and peer-to-peer recruiting effectively by preying on the economically disadvantaged and marginalized, offering them self worth, similar to gangs. That, not any promises connected to the principles of Islam, was the key to ISIS and al Qaeda\u2019s recruiting success.\n\nAnother big takeaway was that while the summit was billed as a look at all violent extremism, in reality over 90 percent of the discussion focused on Muslims. But as the ADL\u2019s Oren Seagal explained on one panel, in last 10 years, non-Muslim terrorism has killed far more Americans. I made that very point in my article earlier this week previewing the summit.\n\nThis approach can cause an inadvertent but tangible backlash to the Muslim community as Linda Sarsour, a Muslim American leader in New York City, correctly pointed out. Sarsour told me via email that by primarily focusing on Muslims, the summit \u201cgives the green light to local and federal law enforcement agencies to subject us to unwarranted surveillance.\u201d\n\nMuslims clearly want to counter terrorism and overwhelmingly want to play a role with the government in preventing radicalization of anyone from our community\u2014even though statistically we are talking maybe 150 people who have traveled to the Middle East from the United States to join ISIS, yet that is still uncertain. But trust is the key for this relationship to work. That very point was made by law enforcement and Muslim American leaders that had joined forces in three cities\u2014Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Boston\u2014as part of the federal government\u2019s pilot program to counter radicalization.\n\nEven President Obama noted \u201cthat engagement with communities can\u2019t be a cover for surveillance\u201d because \u201cthat makes it harder for us to build the trust that we need to work together.\u201d\n\nAnd Obama did his part to engender more trust with the Muslim community. He acknowledged that Muslims have been a part of the fabric of our nation since its inception and that many have served as police officers, first responders, and soldiers.\n\nObama also addressed anti-Muslim bigotry, mentioning the horrible murders of three Muslim American students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, last week. And in a particularly poignant moment, the president read a Valentine\u2019s Day card sent to him from a young Muslim girl named Sabrina, who wrote, \u201cI enjoy being an American. But I am worried about people hating Muslims\u2026If some Muslims do bad things, that doesn\u2019t mean all of them do\u2026Please tell everyone that we are good people and we\u2019re just like everyone else.\u201d\n\nWill the CVE Summit yield any results in countering radicalization? Will it cause a backlash against American Muslims? Time will tell. But the one thing I\u2019m certain is that if you want to help ISIS and al Qaeda, then by all means call them Islamic. If you want to defeat them, call them what they are: terrorists.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:35.290+0000"}

Who\u2019s the big kahuna? Jeb Bush? He keeps getting called front-runner, and I suppose he is, even though the polls sometimes say otherwise. Scott Walker? Certainly a player. Rand Paul? Pretty bad rollout, but he has his base. The youthful, advantageously ethnicized Marco Rubio? Some as-yet-unannounced entrant who can hop in and shake things up?\n\nEach has a claim, sort of, but the 800-pound gorilla of this primary process is none of the above. It\u2019s the same person it was in 2008, and again in 2012, when two quite plausible mainstream-conservative candidates had to haul themselves so far to the right that they ended up being unelectable. It\u2019s the Republican primary voter.\n\nTo be more blunt about it: the aging, white, very conservative, revanchist, fearful voter for whom the primary season is not chiefly an exercise in choosing a credible nominee who might win in November, but a Parris Island-style ideological obstacle course on which each candidate must strain to outdo his competitors\u2014the hate-on-immigrants wall climb, the gay-bashing rope climb, the death-to-the-moocher-class monkey bridge. This voter calls the shots, and after the candidates have run his gauntlet, it\u2019s almost impossible for them to come out looking appealing to a majority of the general electorate.\n\nYou will recall the hash this voter made of 2012. He booed the mention of a United States soldier during a debate because the soldier happened to be gay. He booed contraception\u2014mere birth control, which the vast majority of Republican women, like all women, use. He lustily cheered the death penalty. He tossed Rick Perry out on his ear in part because the Texas governor had the audacity to utter a few relatively humane words about children of undocumented immigrants. He created an atmosphere in which the candidates on one debate stage were terrified of the idea of supporting a single dollar in tax increases even if placed against an offsetting $10 in spending cuts.\n\nYou can\u2019t be a smart candidate in a party that wants to be stupid.\n\nHe is a demanding fellow. And he is already asserting his will this time around. Why else did Bush endorse Indiana Governor Mike Pence\u2019s religious freedom bill in an instant, only to see Pence himself walk the bill back three days later? Bet Jeb would like to have that one back. But he can\u2019t. The primary voter\u2014along of course with the conservative media from Limbaugh and Fox on down\u2014won\u2019t permit it.\n\nNow, as it happens, some of these candidates come to us with a few serious and unorthodox ideas. We all know about Rand Paul and his ideas about sentencing reform and racial disparities. He deserved credit for them. He was a lot quicker on the draw on Ferguson than Hillary Clinton was. But how much do we think he\u2019s going to be talking up this issue as the Iowa voting nears? Time might prove me wrong here, but Paul has already, ah, soul-searched his way to more standard right-wing positions on Israel and war, so there\u2019s reason to think that while he might not do the same on prison issues, he\u2019ll just quietly drop them.\n\nMore interesting in this regard is Rubio. I read his campaign book not long ago, along with five others, for a piece I wrote for The New York Review of Books. Rubio\u2019s book was the best of the lot by far. It was for the most part actually about policy. He put forward a few perfectly good ideas in the book. For example, he favors \u201cincome-based repayment\u201d on student loans, which would lower many students\u2019 monthly student-loan bills. It\u2019s a fine idea. The Obama administration is already doing it.\n\nBeyond the pages of the book, Rubio has in the past couple of years staked out some positions that stood out at the time as not consisting of fare from the standard GOP menu. He\u2019d like to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to more childless couples. Again, there are synergies here with the current occupant of the house Rubio wants to move into\u2014the Obama administration is taking up this idea.\n\nNow, there is to be sure another Rubio, one who\u2019d feel right at home on Parris Island. He is apparently now the quasi-official blessed-be-the-warmakers candidate, with his reflexive hard lines on Iran and Cuba. Along with Senate colleague Mike Lee of Utah, he also has put forth a tax plan that would deplete the treasury by some $4 trillion over 10 years\u2014for context, consider that George W. Bush\u2019s first tax cut cost $1.35 trillion over a decade\u2014in order that most of those dollars be placed in the hands where the Republicans\u2019 God says they belong, i.e., the 1 percent of the people who already hold nearly half the country\u2019s wealth.\n\nI think it\u2019s a safe bet that we\u2019ll see the neocon Rubio and the supply-side Rubio out on the stump. But the Rubio who wants to make life better for indebted students and working-poor childless couples? Either we won\u2019t see that Rubio at all, or we will see him and he\u2019ll finish fourth in Iowa and New Hampshire and go home. You can\u2019t be a smart candidate in a party that wants to be stupid.\n\nMight I be wrong about the primary voter? Sure, I might. Maybe the fear of losing to Hillary Clinton and being shut out of the White House for 12 or 16 consecutive years will tame this beast. But the early signs suggest the opposite.\n\nAfter all, how did Scott Walker bolt to the front of the pack? It wasn\u2019t by talking about how to expand health care. It was by giving one speech, at an event hosted by one of Congress\u2019 most fanatical reactionaries (Steve King of Iowa), bragging about how he crushed Wisconsin\u2019s municipal unions. That\u2019s how you get ahead in this GOP.

But in our swaggery age, even a president has to be able to get down.\n\nPeggy Noonan has joined the chorus of people who think that when President Obama hips it up a little when he talks, he is compromising the dignity of his office and even dividing the country. \u201cHe shouldn't be out there,\u201d she wrote, \u201cdropping his g's, slouching around a podium, complaining about his ill treatment, describing his opponents with disdain: \u2018Stop just hatin' all the time.\u2019\u201d\n\nNo, Ms. Noonan. You and the rest -- and some of you are black -- need to realize that when Obama does things like \u201cdropping his g\u2019s,\u201d he is enhancing the dignity of his office and helping bring the country together.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get the \u201cfake\u201d part out of the way.\n\nI have encountered more than a few who seem honestly to think that when Obama, who generally speaks in a vanilla standard way, uses some black inflection or slang with black audiences, he is being fake. They assume that someone who can sound like Bryant Gumbel could not mean it when he mixes in a little Dave Chappelle. He must be pretending to be something, striking some kind of clumsy tribal note.\n\nWrong. Obama is doing something most black Americans do: using a special repertoire that has a function, to connote warmth and connection. Linguists call it Black English. If Obama is phony in switching into it to strike a certain note, then millions of black people are spending their entire lives being linguistically inauthentic. Doubtful.\n\nAnd -- we must be under no impression that Black English is simply the things generally thought of as slang (or, with less scientific justification, errors) such as ain\u2019t and good old aks for ask. Black English is a whole spice rack beyond this.\n\nTake \u201cfolks,\u201d for example, which Obama used in his mentioning that, \u201cWe tortured some folks.\u201d To many, it sounded like he was trivializing the gravest of issues. But black speakers (and many whites as well) tend to substitute \u201cfolks\u201d for \u201cpeople\u201d to indicate a sense of affection for, or identification with, the people in question. Black academic types (such as Obama) are especially given to saying \u201cblack folks\u201d as a way of indicating that they do not feel superior to ordinary black people despite their own success. Obama\u2019s extension of it to discussing the war on terror was unsurprising.\n\nBlack English is also intonation, which is a powerful rhetorical tool. When Obama was intoning \u201cYes we can!\u201d, it was the music of it that made it sound plausible. John Edwards couldn\u2019t have pulled it off at gunpoint. He isn\u2019t black and so that intonation wouldn\u2019t come naturally to him (and if he imitated it, that would look fake).\n\nNow, on to the \u201cdividing the country\u201d part.\n\nSome readers will be asking whether this speaking style is really a black thing, and they\u2019re on to something. Now, there indeed is a way of speaking -- a certain combination of grammatical patterns and vowel cadences \u2013 that is particular to black people. Linguists have documented it exhaustively \u2013 it\u2019s why we can tell a \u201cblack voice\u201d even when the person is not using any \u201cslang.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s stupid enough that Obama has to downplay his command of Indonesian to avoid looking like a Muslim; must we jump him for using the Black English spice kit?\n\nHowever, standard-speaking whites have a \u201cwarm\u201d English they can slide into as well. Think of George W. Bush as well as his father, both of whom are quite given to \u201cg-dropping.\u201d Or think of Sarah Palin\u2014who, by the way, was rebuked by Noonan in a 2008 column for the same crime of g-dropping, which she commits far more incessantly than Obama does. Bill Clinton can summon a \u201cwarm\u201d air as well, with his Southern background \u2013 so intertwined with the black heritage \u2013 playing a significant part in that.\n\nAnd note that in the case of all the above, the vernacular aspect of their speech has played a part in branding them as dummies in some quarters. Recall Dana Carvey\u2019s imitation of Bush pere with the goofily short sentences, and the dismissal of Clinton as a hillbilly.\n\nThus the idea that brainy, Harvard-educated Obama couldn\u2019t actually mean it when he starts doing his \u201cin\u2019\u201d for \u201c-ing\u201d and such. Surely, that kind of speech is stupid; he\u2019s \u201cplaying dumb.\u201d No. He is, like the Bushes and Bill, being a modern American. Gone are the days when the proper representation of that voice is that of a Disney announcer.\n\nTo be able to speak to modern America pretty much requires being able to switch between the formal and the vernacular to some extent. As archetypically \u201cpresidential\u201d as Mitt Romney seemed, his perfectly square, gee whiz speech style was part of what did him in.\n\nIn today\u2019s America, to not be able to get down, or at least pretend to, is to be inarticulate. We live in a distinctly swaggery age.\n\nObama, then, speaks a larger English than Romney \u2013 or Reagan, or Kennedy. It complements the fact that he is the first president since Martin Van Buren, who grew up speaking Dutch and broke into it when angry, to be raised in a household where more than just English was spoken. It\u2019s stupid enough that Obama has to downplay his command of Indonesian to avoid looking like a Muslim; must we jump him for using the Black English spice kit?\n\nTo the Peggy Noonans among us who cringe when Obama talks \u201cdown\u201d: This is a deeply informal country. Unless you\u2019re ready to start wearing hoop skirts, stick to waltzes, frame your emails with \u201cDear\u201d and \u201cYours Truly,\u201d and roundly condemn all sex outside of the benefit of clergy, you must get used to presidents dropping g\u2019s.

Bernie is a fighter, but he is also, you know, Bernie. O\u2019Malley doesn\u2019t excite, Webb used to be a Republican, and Hillary is, well, a Clinton.\n\nThe 2016 presidential primaries are fast approaching. What is a good progressive to do?\n\nAt a moment when a handful of issues that liberal activists have campaigned on for years, from raising the minimum wage to the growth of corporate power to climate change to criminal justice reform, are entering the mainstream debate\u2014even within the Republican Party\u2014progressives are facing the prospect of being rendered voiceless just as the nation is tuning in to the 2016 presidential primary.\n\n\u201cWhat progressives are saying is, how are we going to get people out of bed to vote if we don\u2019t stand up on the issues that people care about,\u201d said Ed Ott, a longtime New York labor leader and a professor of labor studies at the City University of New York. \u201cThere is a lot of anger at the Democratic Party. People want to know where they stand.\u201d\n\nThis strange moment for progressives was crystallized over the weekend when the liberal Working Families Party, which is based in Clinton\u2019s home state of New York and which backed her in both of her Senate runs, decided to join liberal groups such as Move On and Democracy for America in supporting a Draft Warren effort.\n\nThe move dismayed some progressives. Warren has consistently maintained she isn\u2019t running, and fantasies that she will change her mind distract from some more achievable goals, some liberals maintain.\n\n\u201cThe whole Warren thing is kind of silly,\u201d said Howie Klein, a progressive activist who blogs at the website Down with Tyranny. \u201cIf I could pick anybody to run for president it would be her, but she is not going to do it. It started out as a not-bad idea but I think it has gone on long enough.\u201d\n\nWithout a candidate to get behind, some liberal and labor groups are focusing instead on changing the complexion of the electorate, hoping that Clinton can be pulled to the left by forces on the ground. After a summit on the issue of raising wages (headlined, it should be noted, by Elizabeth Warren) the AFL-CIO announced that they would barnstorm the first four primary states to rally voters around the issue.\n\nThe Progressive Change Campaign Committee, meanwhile, is trying to persuade progressive leaders in Iowa and New Hampshire to hold off announcing that they are ready for Hillary until she publicly announces where she stands on key liberal issues such as expanding Social Security and breaking up big banks.\n\nProgressives are facing the prospect of being rendered voiceless just as the nation is tuning in to the 2016 presidential primary.\n\n\u201cWe really have a one of a kind role at this point, which is being a grassroots force that is working to incentivize all of the Democratic presidential candidates to sound more like Elizabeth Warren,\u201d said Adam Green, the group\u2019s co-founder. \u201cIt\u2019s a different strategy, but we want Warren\u2019s positions to be the mainstream Democratic position.\u201d\n\nAlthough PCCC did not sign on to the Draft Warren effort, Green said that the organizing around it is helping to pull Clinton to the left even without Warren.\n\n\u201cIn many ways the prospect of Elizabeth Warren running might be more powerful than the actual candidacy of Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Green added. \u201cIf she makes no comment about running for president for the next six months there is every incentive in the world for Hillary Clinton to co-opt her message so that Warren doesn\u2019t jump in. If Hillary said, \u2018We should cut Social Security, we don\u2019t need to regulate the banks,\u2019 I think you would see not just Warren but a lot of people jump in.\u201d\n\nA dozen progressive activists, donors and operatives from around the country said much the same thing: their first choice was Warren, and despite her denials, they believe there is still time for her to get into the race, and that she would meet a groundswell of grassroots and fundraising support if she did.\n\n\u201cWe are in a conditional situation\u2014if Hillary runs strong [Warren] won\u2019t run,\u201d said Bob Fertik, a progressive activist and political consultant. \u201cBut Hillary could decide not to run, or she could flame out on any given day for any reason\u2014it could be about Bill, it could be a thousand reasons. If that happens then the entire progressive movement would rise up behind Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nMost progressives interviewed for this story did not sound particularly enthusiastic about the other Democratic challengers.\n\nOn Martin O\u2019Malley, the two-term governor of Maryland who is running cautiously to the left of Clinton, Fertik said, \u201cNobody has heard of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe seems like someone who is running really hard to be vice president. I have no feel for the guy one way or the other,\u201d said Klein.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine he is going to get traction,\u201d said Robert Borosage, the head of the liberal Campaign for America\u2019s Future.\n\nBernie Sanders should be the progressive choice. The socialist senator from Vermont rails against the billionaire class, and unlike Warren, has never been wrapped up in the political money game. Which is precisely the problem.\n\n\u201cUnlike Elizabeth, Bernie is actually running for president. What do you think it says about him that we are all trying to get Elizabeth in,\u201d said one person involved in the Draft Warren effort.\n\n\u201cSanders is extremely progressive,\u201d said Douglas Kahn, who has given more than $100,000 to liberal candidates over the last couple of election cycles. \u201cI would love his ideas and principles to be the platform of the\u2026Party. That is not likely to happen.\u201d\n\nKlein has been raising money for Sanders, but now he thinks the Draft Warren effort has sucked up all of the progressive energy, and he is not certain Sanders will run.\n\n\u201cI think the whole Elizabeth thing has been very disappointing for Bernie.\u201d\n\nSome progressives say they remain curious about the prospect of Webb.\n\n\u201cI think he is going to be stronger than a lot of people think,\u201d said Borosage. \u201cHillary wants to be to the right of Obama on foreign policy, and that opens up space for [Virginia\u2019s Jim] Webb, especially if we get ensnared in the Ukraine or the Middle East and things go south. There remains a huge anti-war sentiment out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have short memories,\u201d responded Klein. \u201cWebb is no lefty. He was to the right of Hillary Clinton on practically every vote.\u201d\n\nOver the last several decades, presidential primaries have provided progressives with a place to give their ideas a full airing. In 2008, John Edwards became a liberal hero for taking an aggressive anti-poverty stance. Howard Dean was turned into a netroots hero thanks to his opposition of the Iraq War. Bill Bradley carried the torch of campaign finance reform in 2000.\n\n\n\nWhich raises the question: What about Hillary? She after all supports Dodd-Frank, favors a higher minimum wage and has long history of fighting for working families. And all the activists spoken to for this article said they would support her in a general election.\n\nBut they also said that at last the public seemed interested in income inequality, and they doubted that Hillary Clinton could carry the torch, especially if she coasted in the primary.\n\n\u201cWhat this election should be about is the very structure of the economy,\u201d said Borosage. \u201cAnd where is Hillary when it comes to shackling Wall Street, when it comes to CEO pay, when it comes to unions. She needs a challenge so we can hear these things out.\u201d\n\nZephyr Teachout, who ran a left-leaning charge against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2014 and who was a key organizer on Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign, said there was plenty of time for someone to emerge, someone perhaps who isn\u2019t being yet discussed in the corridors of Washington D.C.\n\n\u201cThe big fear about Hillary Clinton is that she might be a very weak candidate, and that she doesn\u2019t reflect the best interests of a lot of traditional and populists Democrats. I certainly share those fears, but there is plenty of time for a true populist to jump into the race.\u201d\n\nSo don\u2019t despair then?\n\n\u201cNo! Despair is the ultimate strategy of the neo-liberals, and it doesn\u2019t accomplish anything.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:36.736+0000"}

O\u2019Rourke exposes the dirty little secret of war correspondents: They\u2019re all liars.\n\nI myself was on a Chinook helicopter in 2004 an important mission during the Iraq war. I was standing by the open hatch behind the cockpit. A violent burst of machine gun fire went off inches from my head. I was startled. But I\u2019m a trained professional journalist, and I kept my cool even when we were forced to land in the Middle Eastern desert.\n\nThat is my 6 PM version of the events. However, at the moment it is 10 AM. And all I\u2019ve had to drink is two cups of coffee and glass of orange juice.\n\nWe were forced to land in the Middle Eastern desert because air traffic control told us to. The desert was hundreds of miles from the fighting, at a well-defended U.S. airbase in Kuwait. The violent burst of machinegun fire came from our machinegun, inside the Chinook, aimed a junkyard full of wrecked Kuwaiti cars.\n\nAnd our important mission was to throw Dixie Chicks CDs out the helicopter window because their lead singer had announced she was against the war and was ashamed that President George W. Bush was a fellow Texan, a sentiment not shared by the Chinook crew members, a number of whom were from Texas. Also we were supposed to see if the machine gun worked.\n\nNow, would you care to hear my 11 PM version of the events? Perhaps not. It gets at least as violent, scary and morally fraught as American Sniper. And, while I won\u2019t claim to have been as brave as Chris Kyle, I will claim to have been every bit as brave as Bradley Cooper.\n\nWelcome, Brian Williams, to the International Association of Guys Who\u2019ve Been to War \u2013 And Lied About It Later in the Bar. (I.A.G.W.B2W. -- L.A.I.L.) Membership includes everybody who\u2019s been to war or near a war or in rough proximity to something that is remotely comparable to the dangers and hazards of war, such a being a teenage volunteer fireman who saved puppies from a smoky building.\n\nI, like you, Brian, was a reporter in some troubled places \u2013 Lebanon, El Salvador, Kuwait, Somalia, Bosnia, (where, in fact, I came under that very same sniper fire which greeted Hillary and Chelsea Clinton) and, of course, Iraq.\n\nI have a younger friend who is presently a reporter in some places that are even more troubled \u2013 Afghanistan, Sudan, Ethiopia, Rwanda and the Congo. My younger friend just came to visit me for a ski weekend in New Hampshire where it\u2019s been 30 degrees below zero with winds blowing at the force of Hurricane Katrina, snow (doubtless full of frozen skier dead bodies) drifting too deep for us to escape the Lift Line Bar and Grill where we courted serious health problems drinking our lunch while the ski lodge was terrorized by rowdy snow boarder teens. This being what we told my wife and his girlfriend when we got back from skiing at about the time the David Letterman show goes on the air.\n\n\u201cEvery year the attack on Pearl Harbor sinks more aircraft carriers, the Banzai! charges come faster and thicker in the jungles of the South Pacific, the kamikaze pilots blow up a larger part of the ship and each of these guys takes an another hill single-handed.\u201d\n\nWhile my younger friend \u2013 we\u2019ll call him Tom -- and I were pounding through the moguls, doing flips off 4-meter jumps and performing halfpipe 360s down the double black diamond run known in the Lift Line Bar and Grill as \u201cMahogany Ridge,\u201d a certain NBC anchorman \u201cmade a mistake in recalling events.\u201d Maybe somewhat like the mistake in recalling events I\u2019m making right now, with my recollection of having planted that 360 perfectly.\n\nTom and I searched our memories. We have, between us, more than half a century of personal experience with people who fought, covered, survived, or who were otherwise wandering around lost, clueless and conflating in the fog of war.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t think of anyone who hadn\u2019t Brian Williamsed. We gave up and began telling war stories to the very cute barmaid.\n\nAt Elaine\u2019s Restaurant in New York in the 1970s, Elaine kept a table reserved for James Jones, Norman Mailer, Herman Wouk, and Irwin Shaw, authors, respectively, of From Here to Eternity, The Naked and the Dead, The Caine Mutiny and The Young Lions.\n\nPut those four books together and you have the Iliad of WWII. Elaine called the four authors \u201cThe Old Lions.\u201d Elaine told me, \u201cEvery year the attack on Pearl Harbor sinks more aircraft carriers, the Banzai! charges come faster and thicker in the jungles of the South Pacific, the kamikaze pilots blow up a larger part of the ship and each of these guys takes an another hill single-handed.\u201d\n\nThink what a crap book the Iliad would be if it told the real story of Greeks spending ten years squatting in the mud besieging a one-horse, as it were, town in the sticks of Asia Minor.\n\nAnd just the other night, after a very long day of skiing, I told a story similar to the story that Ulysses told Penelope in the Odyssey about why he was so late getting back from the Trojan War.\n\nMy Uncle Mikey-Mike had an even better story about fighting (mostly single-handed) the battle of Iwo Jima. Uncle Mikey-Mike was a Marine. He spent the war stateside in the hospital with an infected toe. But around my house we thought of Uncle Mikey-Mike\u2019s stories (which commenced after 6 PM) as \u201cbungled attempts to honor one special veteran\u201d \u2013 Uncle Mikey-Mike.\n\nSo here\u2019s to you, Brian Williams.

{"entityId": 1672, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Many believe Jeffrey Epstein could have been jailed for life for violating scores of underage girls, but Ken Starr and the rest of his legal team got him a deal.\n\nIt was supposed to be a probe into the first family\u2019s finances. But when independent counsel Judge Ken Starr mounted an investigation into the Clintons\u2019 real-estate deals, the \u201cWhitewater\u201d probe took a peep-show turn. Starr and his team began to obsess over every lurid detail of Bill Clinton\u2019s philandering, issuing a 473-page report that was a catalog of misuse of funds but mostly torrid sexcapades in the White House and the president accused of committing perjury to cover it up.\n\nThe Starr Report came out in 1998. And all of this would be history, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Starr, the legendary moral ninny now serving as the chancellor at Baylor University, was handpicked nearly a decade later to negotiate a sweetheart plea deal with state and federal prosecutors for billionaire pederast and Clinton crony Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, some of Epstein\u2019s lawyers were back in court, arguing that the negotiations over that deal must remain secret.\n\n\u201cI had given [Epstein] a list of lawyers I worked with in the past that had been exceptionally able and Jeffrey picked from the list,\u201d Alan Dershowitz, the world-famous criminal attorney and Harvard professor, told The Daily Beast. He also worked on Epstein\u2019s behalf. \u201cStarr had experience in investigating sex investigations,\u201d Dershowitz said. \u201cHe had experience as the solicitor general and as a judge. He had all the bases covered.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition proved to be a panacea. In 2006, Jeffrey Epstein was hauled in by Palm Beach police for violating scores of underage girls for years and was facing federal charges for trafficking them across state lines. He was formally sentenced to 18 months prison, but only served 13 of them and was allowed to travel between his various mansions frequently. He was also forced to register as a sex offender.\n\nMany believe Epstein dodged certain doom\u2014he could have remained behind bars for the rest of his life given the number of alleged victims (some say it\u2019s as many as hundreds, while his attorneys suggest it\u2019s barely double-digits). But ask the client and he believes the plea agreement was lousy.\n\n\u201cJeffrey didn\u2019t think it was a good deal,\u201d Dershowitz said. And that may have been because Epstein\u2019s all-star legal team\u2014which included Starr, Dershowitz, Miami lawyer Roy Black, New York power esquires Jay Lefkowitz and Gerald Lefcourt, and Martin Weinberg in Boston\u2014apparently couldn\u2019t seal an even sweeter deal.\n\n\u201cIt was with the [Florida] state attorney,\u201d Dershowitz said. \u201cIt was only after the federal government came in that this deal was struck. But we originally had a better deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cStarr had experience in investigating sex investigations,\u201d Dershowitz said. \u201cHe had experience as the solicitor general and as a judge. He had all the bases covered.\u201d\n\nStill, in retrospect, Dershowitz is pleased with the result. \u201cWe got the best deal we thought we could get,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the role I played in getting Jeffrey Epstein the deal. He wasn\u2019t happy with it. He thought perhaps we could have done better.\u201d\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t the prosecutors nail Epstein to the wall with all of his statuatory rapes? Dershowitz says the evidence against Epstein \u201cwas virtually nonexistent.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Epstein\u2019s attorneys have been fighting to this day to keep the negotiations around that plea deal hidden from the public.\n\nMartin Weinberg told The Daily Beast there\u2019s an understanding that such correspondence among lawyers is privileged and shouldn\u2019t be for public consumption.\n\n\u201cOur effort to maintain the privacy of our legal communications leading up to the Non-Prosecution Agreement in the Epstein case is completely consistent with the traditional privacy and confidentiality accorded to such negotiations in every case that I have participated in for over 40 years as a practicing criminal defense attorney.\u201d\n\nAsked about the decision to suppress the legal correspondence that pertains directly to the plea deal, Dershowitz suggested he was out of the loop. \u201cI was not consulted on that decision,\u201d but refused to expand.\n\nStarr refused to answer questions submitted by The Daily Beast for this story.\n\nBut whatever innuendo one might draw about Starr coming on board, Dershowitz believes the former puritan prosecutor was effectively an ace. \u201cHe helped negotiate the plea bargain,\u201d Dershowitz said. \u201cHe made proposals and made counterproposals.\u201d\n\nAnd the elocutionary trial lawyer in Dershowitz said he was blown away by Starr\u2019s powerful delivery. \u201cI was with him at a planning session for Epstein and his input was extraordinary.\u201d\n\nStarr, as one of Epstein\u2019s hired guns, managed to give the legal team insight into federal law and used his Justice Department seasoning to steer the team to avoid potential pitfalls. \u201cHe a was significant part.\u201d\n\nWeinberg confirmed that Starr, who was then a partner at Kirkland & Ellis (as was Epstein\u2019s other attorney, Jay Lefkowitz) \u201cwas a core participant\u201d for the defense. \u201cJudge Starr joined the defense team because of his skills, experience, and legal wisdom and for no other reason.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more is on Wednesday, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s lawyers moved to keep sealed what is potentially thousands of documents (including correspondence among Epstein\u2019s lawyers and state and federal attorneys) hashing out a plea deal. The convicted sex offender\u2019s lawyers want that information to be sealed \u201cuntil the court can make a considered determination of these traditionally confidential plea negotiations should be made part of this public record.\u201d\n\nAnd according to sources, Starr\u2019s handprints are on some of those documents.\n\nStarr served as a judge in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. and later became the country\u2019s solicitor general back in the 1980s. But he became a household name in the \u201990s when he went after a president. As a self-appointed moral sheriff, Starr almost seemed to trumpet Clinton\u2019s fall from grace\u2014winning him friends on the Christian right and turning him into a witch-hunting pariah with the left.\n\nAfter the Starr Report landed, Ken Starr was torched for portraying the White House as some sort of bordello.\n\nAt one point there are pages and pages of at least 10 incidents involving President Bill Clinton trysting with former intern Monica Lewinsky at 1600 Pennsylvania. She would usually give Mr. Clinton oral sex in the \u201cwindowless hallway outside the study\u201d or got it on \u201cagainst the doorway of the bathroom across the study, which he told Ms. Lewinsky, eased his sore back.\u201d Her famous stained dress turned out to contain \u201cthe president\u2019s semen.\u201d A cigar was used as a dipstick sex toy back in 1996 where Clinton began kissing her bare breasts and fondling her genitals. \u201cAt one point, the president inserted a cigar into Ms. Lewinsky\u2019s vagina, then put the cigar in his mouth and said: \u201cIt tastes good.\u201d\n\nAnd despite the fury for reenacting all of the sordid sex details in excruciating detail, Starr said that was the cost of doing business. In the Starr Report, he wrote: \u201cThe details are crucial to an informed evaluation of the testimony, the credibility of witnesses, and the reliability of other evidence. Many of the details reveal highly personal information; many are sexually explicit. This is unfortunate, but it is essential.\u201d\n\nThe son of a preacher man, Starr\u2019s Texas upbringing is something he routinely falls back on while describing growing up in San Antonio, Texas. For Starr, \u201cchurch and scripture and church events were a regular part of life.\u201d\n\nStarr propped himself up to Diane Sawyer as someone who remains faithful to his wife. \u201cThe answer to the big question is no. I have not been unfaithful to my spouse. I try to, and I, you know, I\u2019m not trying to pat myself on the back, but I\u2019ve tried to live by what I believe is my obligation and my responsibility.\u201d\n\nWhen Epstein\u2019s defense team notched such a nuclear name in Ken Starr, sources tell The Daily Beast it was to balance the political scales.\n\nBut Dershowitz dismisses that. \u201cI did not know anything about the political affiliations of the lawyers,\u201d he said. \u201cI never recommend lawyers based their political affiliations. That\u2019s just not the way I go about things. That\u2019s not my style.\u201d\n\nStill, there are plenty who will wonder how the self-proclaimed Boy Scout managed to go to bat to get a sex fiend off. \u201cMany lawyers would say that they pass no moral judgment on their clients, but I\u2019m not sure that Kenneth Starr can plausibly offer that excuse,\u201d said Joe Conason, editor in Chief of the National Memo, who co-wrote the book The Hunting of the President. \u201cAs for why Starr would represent Jeffrey Epstein, you will have to ask him\u2014certainly not because he thought it would improve his reputation. Then again, perhaps he assumed nobody would find out.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:37.297+0000"}

Now the GOP just has to figure out how to win over female voters.\n\nIt was not a battle of their choosing. They wanted peace, they say. But more than two years after the first shots were fired in the \u201cwar on women,\u201d when Todd Akin mused aloud about \u201clegitimate rape,\u201d a group of conservative women say the war is over\u2014and that they won.\n\n\u201cWhat do most women do every week? Do they fill up the gas tank and the grocery cart? Or do they get an abortion?\u201d said GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway to a roomful of conservative activists and congressional staffers Monday afternoon.\n\nThe occasion was a panel discussion, \u201cWar No More, \u201d hosted by Concerned Women for America, an evangelical Christian woman\u2019s group that stands as a counter to the liberal National Organization for Women.\n\nAs Conway and her co-panelists saw it, the Democrats pulled a masterful bait-and-switch in 2012, when they hyped up comments by Akin and by Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock\u2014who said unintended pregnancies as a result of rape were \u201csomething God intended\u201d\u2014into a \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe notion that we can\u2019t think about anything other than from the waist down is congenitally flawed,\u201d Conway said. This was borne out in 2014, she said, when Democrats doubled down on the war plan but suffered a series of losses, even though at least one candidate, Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, went so heavy on the reproductive health rhetoric that one of his own campaign supporters started calling him Mark Uterus.\n\nAs far as Republicans are concerned, the sooner this particular war is over, the sooner they can begin to clear the battlefield and tend to the wounded.\n\nIn 2012, women broke for Barack Obama by 11 points. And two-thirds of unmarried women, a growing slice of the electorate, voted for the Democrat. This year, with Hillary Clinton\u2014or, as CWA president Penny Nance called her, \u201cClaire Underwood\u201d\u2014the likely Democratic nominee, the margin could widen further.\n\n\u201cThe right simply doesn\u2019t take gender differences seriously enough,\u201d said Sabrina Schaeffer, the president of the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, warning that progressives were already far ahead of conservatives on their messaging. \u201cThinking about and talking to women is not the same as pandering. It is not the same as playing gender differences.\u201d\n\nAccording to the panelists, Republicans can cut into that gap by reminding voters that no matter how bad the war on women may seem, it is not as bad as a real war.\n\n\u201cWomen are being violated at the hands of Islamic jihadists,\u201d said Nance. According to Conway, the rise of terrorism overseas helped beat back the Democratic advance in 2014.\n\nWomen then found out, she said, that \u201cISIS\u2019s idea of birth control is to eradicate Western civilization.\u201d\n\nThe other prong to the 2016 strategy is to go on offense on the abortion question. If Republicans have to answer questions about whether they believe in birth control, Democrats should have to answer questions about exactly how far their support of abortion extends. Does it extend to taxpayer-funded abortions? Sex-selective abortions? Abortions after 20 weeks?\n\n\u201cThe notion that we can\u2019t think about anything other than from the waist down is congenitally flawed.\u201d\n\nFinally, if Democrats have professed outrage at every ill-considered remark a Republican man makes, it is time for the GOP to do the same. Carly Fiorina, herself a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, showed the audience how it was done: She reminded them of the time that Sen. Joni Ernst, \u201ca sitting senator, a mother, a wife, a veteran,\u201d was called \u201cwindow dressing\u201d by EMILY\u2019s List. The audience audibly gasped.\n\nBut if conservative female political strategists want to expand the notion of women\u2019s issues to something beyond reproductive health care, they may find themselves with even more explaining to do.\n\nThe pay gap between men and women is \u201cgreatly exaggerated,\u201d according to Nance, and according to Schaeffer, a result of \u201cwomen\u2019s choices, and maybe a little bit of discrimination as well.\u201d Either way, they said, it is an issue not best redressed by Congress.\n\nInstead, the panelists, which toward the end included Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the highest-ranking Republican woman in Congress, said their task was to explain why increasing the minimum wage, expanding paid sick and family leave, and addressing the pay gap would hurt women more than it would help them.\n\nAccording to Fiorina, the key to ending the pay gap was by giving the older generation a haircut. Seniority, she said, kept people from being paid their worth.\n\nSeniority systems were the reason \u201cwe keep getting inspector general reports that say that people watching porn all day long are getting paid exactly the same as someone who works hard and does their job. And who supports the seniority system? Unions. Government bureaucracies. The constituencies that the Democrats like to protect.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the war on women may be over.

{"entityId": 1674, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Republicans have won control of nearly half the state legislatures, which could affect everything from reproductive rights to how electoral votes are distributed.\n\nConsider the state legislative landscape after this month\u2019s midterm elections: Republicans successfully kept or took control of 30 state legislatures; in 24 states, Republicans control both legislative branches and the governorship. At the same time, Democrats lost ground, now maintaining unilateral control in just six states, down from 11 before the midterms.\n\nIt\u2019s an unprecedented sweep for the GOP at the state level, and in a year that saw nearly across-the-board Republican wins, it\u2019s a breathtaking expansion of largely unchecked lawmaking power.\n\nThere\u2019s a story here about gerrymandering, and the successful tactics employed by right-wing activists to build a robust candidate farm team and push primary turnout. But what it means is this: As the country continues to tilt leftward, the laws that most directly impact Americans\u2019 lives will be passed by legislators from the opposite end of the political spectrum.\n\nIf you want to know what\u2019s on deck for GOP-controlled states, look no further than Michigan, a reliably blue state in presidential elections with a Republican governor and legislature. Two years ago, lawmakers in this staunch pro-labor stronghold passed anti-union right-to-work laws. They also passed a slew of legislation (PDF) limiting women\u2019s reproductive rights.\n\nOh, and about that \u201cblue state\u201d thing? Last week, a Republican state lawmaker introduced a bill that would change the way the state awards its 16 electoral votes. Instead of winner-take-all, an arrangement that clearly benefits Democrats in states like Michigan, the winner of the state\u2019s popular vote would get half of Michigan\u2019s electoral votes, with an additional electoral vote awarded for every 1.5 percent of the vote received above 50 percent. The second-place major party candidate would get the remainder.\n\nEven if this doesn\u2019t fly in Michigan\u2014there\u2019s the potential for some deal making, because legislative Republicans need Dem backing on a roads bill\u2014expect to see similar bills introduced in populous states with high electoral vote counts and GOP-controlled legislatures. This is a new spin on a GOP scheme to create a more favorable Republican playing field for the 2016 presidential election. And if it can happen there, it can happen anywhere\u2014and will.\n\nIn New Mexico and Kentucky, right-to-work is on the agenda, with lawmakers empowered by decisive midterm results introducing such bills during legislative lame-duck sessions. It\u2019s the same playbook followed by elected officials in Wisconsin and Michigan, where right-to-work is now law.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in Michigan, right-to-work bills mirrored model legislation drafted by American Legislative Exchange Council, a group funded by billionaire Tea Party magnates David and Charles Koch, almost word for word. Another Koch-funded group, Americans for Prosperity, hailed Michigan\u2019s 2012 adoption of right-to-work laws as \u201cthe shot heard round the world\u201d in the fight against unions.\n\nSpeaking of ALEC: In the wake of a constitutional amendment undermining abortion rights in Tennessee, lawmakers have proposed legislation that would require women to view not just a fetal ultrasound 24 to 72 before receiving an abortion, but listen to a fetal heartbeat.\n\nThe GOP lawmakers who plan to enact these socially regressive agendas are already in office, frequently to the chagrin of their more moderate Republican colleagues.\n\nSuch laws are called \u201ctargeted regulation of abortion providers,\u201d and are often aimed at closing abortion clinics by creating legal requirements the facilities can\u2019t afford to comply with. As it happens, ALEC has drafted some model TRAP legislation (PDF), and these kinds of bills are perennial favorites with GOP lawmakers.\n\nAs more Americans voice support of same-sex marriage (and as most appellate courts rule against same-sex marriage bans), expect to see a wave of state laws mimicking the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. RFRA, which applies to the federal government but not state governments, was intended to protect Native American tribes that used peyote during religious rites. State RFRAs would allow businesses owners to legally discriminate against same-sex couples.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just the first round of legislation the newly empowered Republicans are planning to unleash. I like to end columns with a potential policy fix, some kind of suggested action, or at least a stern finger-wagging. Government shouldn\u2019t be a spectator sport.\n\nThis time, I\u2019ve got nothing. The GOP lawmakers who plan to enact these socially regressive agendas are already in office, frequently to the chagrin of their more moderate Republican colleagues. The (in many cases gerrymandered) districts that assured those lawmakers\u2019 victories are still in place, and if state legislatures remain GOP-controlled, redistricting after the 2020 U.S. Census isn\u2019t likely to change that.\n\nTo be clear, unilateral Democratic control is just as problematic as the reverse. Our system of checks and balances works best when there\u2019s push-pull, when lawmakers have to make deals to get stuff done. Discussion and compromise work in constituents\u2019 favor.

{"entityId": 1675, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Obama administration asked Congress for $5 billion to fight terrorism but offered no details about how the money would be spent. Democrats want to give Obama the money anyway.\n\nDemocrats in Congress are ready to give the Obama administration $5 billion in new funding to fight ISIS and other terror groups, despite the fact that the administration has no idea how the money will be spent.\n\nWhen the president calls for Congress to approve his new counterterrorism fund in his speech Wednesday, it's unlikely he'll mention that for the last four months his administration has stifled calls from inside and outside the government for the White House to specify exactly what the money is for. The White House\u2019s lack of urgency led to some to believe they weren\u2019t actually invested in seeing the fund become a reality, but just wanted to create the appearance of doing something to fight Islamic extremists.\n\nNow, looking for a quick way to pay for what the White House is promising will be a long struggle against ISIS, the fund is back in vogue both inside the administration and on Capitol Hill. Similar to the overall plan to defeat ISIS, details of the fund remain scarce, yet the process is moving forward due of a mix of fear and confusion.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the details are, so we can\u2019t say what is in it and what isn\u2019t,\u201d said Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin, who said the fund could be used to fight ISIS in Iraq or even Syria if that\u2019s what the president decides to do. \u201cI think that kind of flexibility is useful.\u201d\n\nIt wasn't always so. When President Obama first proposed his new Counterterrorism Partnership Fund in his West Point speech in May, the public announcement came as a total surprise to lawmakers and even officials in his own administration. The White House had not consulted anyone and had no details about what they planned to do with the money, other than to support and bolster countries on the front lines of the terror war, from Jordan to Yemen to Mali.\n\nLeaders in both chambers and both parties were especially skeptical of Obama\u2019s idea that $500 million of that money would be used to train the moderate Syrian rebels. Without more details, Congress said, there\u2019s no way that they would just hand over the cash.\n\nThen ISIS took over a major Iraqi city, expanded its reach across Syria and into Lebanon, and most recently distributed videos of their beheading of two American journalists. Now lawmakers, especially the Democrats, are singing a different tune.\n\nSeveral top Democratic and Republican senators told The Daily Beast on Friday that the administration has given Congress zero details about the proposed fund and consultations have been next to nonexistent. But Democrats said that was perfectly fine with them.\n\n\u201cI support doing what we need to do to defeat ISIS,\u201d Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez told The Daily Beast when asked about the fund.\n\nSenate appropriators are already preparing to hand Obama the $5 billion. The draft of the defense appropriations bill would give the Pentagon $4 billion of the funds. The draft of the State Department and foreign operations appropriations bill contains the other $1 billion. All the money would be classified as war funding in the overseas contingency operations part of the defense budget.\n\nSen. Barbara Mikulski, the chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she was open to including the money in the catch-all omnibus government spending bill Congress needs to pass before leaving Washington, D.C., for the fall campaigns.\n\n\u201cMy goal [for the spending bill] is: no government shutdown, do no harm, position for an omnibus, and have the money to deal with the national security threats facing the nation,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the details are, so we can\u2019t say what is in it and what isn\u2019t. I think that kind of flexibility is useful.\u201d\n\nLawmakers continued Tuesday a Kabuki-style debate over a vote on authorizing Obama's ISIS war that is near impossible to muster before Congress adjourns next week for their pre-election campaigns.\n\nCaught between their desire to preserve their constitutional war-making authority and the fear of political backlash, Congress is paralyzed and leadership has no intention of forcing the issue before the break.\n\nBesides, lawmakers say, there\u2019s no way to vote on a strategy that hasn\u2019t yet been articulated by the president.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons some in the GOP are not as eager to give Obama a blank check. The top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, said Tuesday that Congress has not been able to debate the fund because they still don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no discussions because I don\u2019t know any details,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want to know what\u2019s it for,\u201d said Sen. John McCain, who said the prime reason that Obama proposed the fund was \u201cbecause it looks good.\u201d\n\nMcCain and other GOP senators said that without a strategy, it makes no sense to appropriate the money. He is pushing for a strategy that includes military action inside Syria, which he argues is necessary to defeat ISIS.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s about whether there\u2019s a strategy and a goal. If there\u2019s no goal, there\u2019s no strategy, and if that\u2019s the case we don\u2019t want to waste the taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem is you can\u2019t just request money and not have a plan for how you\u2019re going to use it and what the ultimate goals you\u2019re trying to accomplish might be,\u201d said Senate Appropriator Susan Collins.\n\nInside the administration, State Department and Pentagon officials told The Daily Beast that they believe the White House has been intentionally slow to fill in the details of the fund, especially the $500 million for Syria, because the White House is reluctant to actually start actively arming the moderate Syrian rebels.\n\nThe CIA has been for more than a year working closely on vetting and training Syrian opposition forces despite recent assessments that the Free Syrian Army itself would not be a suitable partner for any potential U.S. military operations on the ground. \u201cThis has been Brennan\u2019s baby,\u201d one U.S. intelligence official told The Daily Beast, referring to the agency\u2019s director, John Brennan. \u201cThis has been his little fiefdom until recently.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear whether the Syrian opposition training will remain Brennan\u2019s fiefdom for long. Another U.S. intelligence official said the U.S. military would be taking over the training at least for any future Syria opposition forces. The first intelligence official said some of the opposition forces operating in the south were considered more moderate, and more likely to supply more of the fighters for the training program. The program was also closely coordinated, according to this source, with the Jordanian security services.\n\nThe State Department is pushing the White House and the CIA to approve more moderate rebel groups for training and equipping by the U.S. as soon as possible. The $500 million would be enough to train and arm 3,000 rebel fighters over two years, officials said, hardly enough troops in enough time to stop ISIS\u2019s rapid advances.\n\nPresident Obama called the Syrian rebels\u2019 attempt to defeat the Assad regime a \u201cfantasy\u201d only weeks after he requested half a billion to arm them. Today, the president of the Syrian National Coalition, Hadi AlBahra, wrote to Obama to ask him to expedite the funds not because of Assad but because of ISIS.\n\n\u201cYour leadership is greatly needed to authorize and appropriate this program, given the threat posed by ISIS to hundreds of thousands of civilians in northern Syria,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe welcome your country\u2019s generous provision of humanitarian aid, but a surge of U.S. security assistance to the Free Syrian Army to help in this vital fight is now necessary.\u201d\n\nObama is sure to talk about the fund in his speech Wednesday night where he has promised to lay out his strategy for combatting ISIS. On Monday, Press Secretary Josh Earnest called on Congress to quickly approve the funds, despite that there is no clarity on how the money would be used.\n\nNed Price, spokesman for the National Security Council, told The Daily Beast that the administration had briefed Congress several times on the fund. He said the lack of detail was a good thing and that the Pentagon and State Department would choose how to spend the money after they get it.\n\n\u201cThe [fund] will provide the flexibility and resources required to respond to urgent and emergent needs as terrorist threats around the world continue to evolve,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why our discussions with Congress have focused on examples of potential CTPF-funded initiatives, rather than specific programmatic details and why we have committed to robust consultation with Congress on the development of programs under this initiative.\u201d\n\n\u2014 with additional reporting by Eli Lake", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:38.254+0000"}

With her second out-of-wedlock child on the way, the one-time \u201cabstinence ambassador\u201d has shown a disregard for \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d that should offend any number of devout patisserie owners and pizzeria proprietors.\n\nThe young Palin\u2019s recent remarks defending the pregnancy as \u201cplanned\u201d are actually quite damning in that regard. She asserts, \u201cEveryone knows I wanted more kids, to have a bigger family\u201d and that she believed herself to be \u201cheading that way\u201d\u2014an oblique reference to her broken engagement to Dakota Meyer\u2014but that \u201cthings did not go according to plan.\u201d\n\nWhen everything does \u201cnot go according to plan,\u201d that usually means the result is \u201cunplanned,\u201d but here I take it that by \u201cplanned\u201d she means \u201cwanted.\u201d (If she needed the difference between \u201cplanned\u201d and \u201cwanted\u201d clarified, and maybe avoid other situations that \u201cdid not go according to plan,\u201d there\u2019s a place she could go that helpfully has \u201cplanned\u201d in its very name.)\n\nI\u2019m thrilled the baby is wanted, but Palin\u2019s own narrative, and delight in growing her family, gives lie to the line conservatives continue to push: that traditional marriage is fundamental to family. By many conservatives\u2019 definition, one 24-year-old and two kids is not a meaningful family. And, certainly, \u201cheading that way\u201d is not \u201cmarriage.\u201d Jim Obergefell could have told her that years ago.\n\nHowever flimsy they are as excuses, Palin needs to invoke \u201cheading that way\u201d and \u201chaving a family,\u201d because those are the only reasons a \u201cgood\u201d Christian can possibly give for sex before marriage. The alternatives are either unrealistic (IVF mixup? The supernatural?) or, among conservative Christians, unspeakable.\n\n\n\nJust watch this clip of Palin stiffly bantering with premature has-been Mike \u201cThe Situation\u201d Sorrentino. They spend much of the minute and a half euphemizing themselves. \u201cTrust me, though, I\u2019m not getting myself into another situation,\u201d she says. \u201cI avoid situations.\u201d Welp.\n\nSo how could we possibly expect Palin now to admit a completely plausible truth: that however much she wanted a family, or believed that she would be married, she had sex before marriage because she wanted to have sex before marriage?\n\nImagine that. I mean, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some fan fiction out there.\n\nBecause Palin says she wanted to have kids and thought she was about to get married, I imagine most of her conservative Christian brethren will be quick to forgive her. They may not even recognize her trespass as a very troubling sin. If she were to admit that she was less family-minded and more DTF, well, at least the sex was procreative. It\u2019s not like she was gay.\n\nThat gay sex is non-procreative is one of the main the reason so many Christians find it troubling. (Well, I suspect there are others, less easily brought to light.) They have created a kind of catch-22 of sin by using that argument as a reason gay people shouldn\u2019t be able to get married, and (in their minds, and Texas) eliminate the category of marriage as a possibility.\n\nIndeed, one irony of the post-Obergefell world is that, finally, unmarried gays will get to live in sin.\n\nIf she were to admit that she was less family-minded and more DTF, well, at least the sex was procreative. It\u2019s not like she was gay.\n\nSuch a designation is easy to take lightly, especially if you\u2019ve been sinning by others\u2019 definition for years, but Palin\u2019s defiant announcement reminds us that in many quarters, marriage equality will do little for how people think about LGBT people. For conservative Christians, the problem with sex will always be sex, not marriage.\n\nLGBT activists\u2019 emphasis on marriage equality has been an explicitly political choice. As Andrew Sullivan pointed out decades ago, to ask for marriage equality is an inherently conservative argument. It\u2019s also a romantic one. Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s decision was appropriately swooning and will likely be incorporated into people\u2019s wedding vows for years to come.\n\nBut I hope it\u2019s not too soon to remind people that when it comes to full equality, #lovewins is not necessarily about marriage, it\u2019s about being able to love whomever you want\u2014or to make love with whomever you want, even if you\u2019re not planning on loving them longer than a night.\n\nIn the avalanche of rainbows, it\u2019s easy to forget that marriage equality is a step toward LGBT equality, not its end goal. Full civil rights for LGBT people would mean accepting them as married couples, sure, but also accepting them as people who might have sex outside of marriage\u2014just like Bristol Palin.\n\nThe impulse to mock Palin for her predicament is well-nigh impossible to resist. Obviously, I have succumbed to it here. But we should not let the deliciousness of the irony keep us from sensing the genuine human pain that\u2019s at the center of it. Whatever her faults and hypocrisies, Palin is now single when she didn\u2019t expect to be single, and a mother in a family structure that her closest allies regard as second-best. While she likely doesn\u2019t share other single mothers\u2019 economic struggles, she faces the same emotional obstacle course of intense joy and lonely exhaustion.\n\nAfter all, what really separates conservatives and progressives in their reactions to unplanned pregnancies isn\u2019t how they feel about the pregnancy, it\u2019s how they feel about the woman carrying it. I hope Palin finds the support she needs, and I will be happy to bake her cake.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:38.714+0000"}
{"entityId": 1677, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "In 2012, Mitt Romney lost women voters by 11 points, and Republicans lost them by 11 points. This year the GOP closed that gap\u2014and one all-female consulting firm is a big reason why.\n\nWhen Katie Packer Gage and Ashley O\u2019Connor sat down to lunch at Boston\u2019s Anthem restaurant one day in the winter of 2012, their conversation quickly turned to what had gone wrong with Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nGage had been Romney\u2019s deputy campaign manager, while O\u2019Connor was director of advertising. Both took part in the campaign\u2019s daily strategy meetings, and both were asking themselves how Romney had lost to Barack Obama by four points. That defeat was driven largely by Romney losing women voters by an insurmountable 11 points.\n\n\u201cRepublicans weren\u2019t doing a very effective job of communicating the Republican message to women,\u201d said Gage. \u201cWe asked how we could go about doing that better, and ultimately that\u2019s how Burning Glass came together.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou let the opponents\u2019 own words work against them. Therefore, we\u2019re not attacking her, we\u2019re saying, \u2018Here\u2019s where she stands, here\u2019s what she\u2019s saying.\u201d\n\nBurning Glass Consulting is the all-female consulting firm Gage and O\u2019Connor founded in 2013 along with GOP pollster Christine Matthews to focus Republican campaigns solely on refining their message to women voters. Burning Glass is also a major piece of the puzzle of how the GOP was able not only to neutralize but in some cases defeat the Democrats\u2019 \u201cwar on women\u201d message that had hurt some Republican campaigns badly with female voters in 2010 and 2012.\n\nAs a party, Burning Glass told Republicans, they needed to recruit better candidates, shut down GOP voices that made comments that would be offensive to women voters, and prepare campaigns for the Democrats to replay their \u201cwar on women\u201d message in 2014 on a national scale.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things that we felt was important was avoiding another Todd Akin or Richard Murdock moment, which was so difficult to deal with in 2012,\u201d Gage said. \u201cThe whole candidate-recruitment process, making sure that one candidate was not going to put our whole party in a negative light, was something we felt strongly about.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connor also said the party needed better polling information about women voters, including why so many had responded to the Democrats\u2019 message in 2012 that Republicans were essentially bad for women, especially on social issues.\n\n\u201cComing into 2014, we really wanted to have some good research and data to be able to talk about how to handle this, because we knew it was coming,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cFor us, it was really important to make sure that candidates were ready for this and that they knew how to handle it. We learned that you can\u2019t just dismiss it. You have to be ready to talk about those issues as well as other issues.\u201d\n\nOver the course of 2013 and 2014, as Democratic campaigns targeted female voters on abortion rights, equal pay, and access to birth control, Burning Glass worked with the House Republican caucus to train members to avoid Todd Akin-style gaffes about things like \u201clegitimate rape\u201d; with Senate Republican candidates on debate prep and issue messaging around the Affordable Care Act; and with independent expenditure groups on the tone and tenor of their ads.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. Burning Glass\u2019s 2014 client list reads like a page out of the new Senate roster, including candidates or groups in Arkansas, Georgia, Colorado, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia. In each contest, the Republican candidate outperformed the GOP result from 2012 among women voters. All but Ed Gillespie in Virginia won, and even Gillespie made significant gains among female voters compared to now-Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s nine-point win over Ken Cuccinelli.\n\nAmong GOP victories in 2014, no other race is quite as emblematic of Republicans\u2019 new approach to women as the Colorado Senate race, where incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall lost to Rep. Cory Gardner after Udall spent nearly the entire campaign talking about women\u2019s access to abortion and birth control. Gardner, a sunny, 40-year-old House member, responded with a position championed by Burning Glass for Republicans to stand by their opposition to abortion, but also push for women\u2019s expanded access by making it available without a prescription.Udall won with women by four points, but it wasn\u2019t enough to counter Gardner\u2019s 20-point margin among men.\n\n\u201cColorado was a great example of Democrats deciding to run a playbook and stick to it,\u201d said O\u2019Connor. \u201cI think Sen. Udall make a really grave mistake by only focusing on \u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019 and just beating it over and over and over when people, and especially women, in Colorado wanted to hear more from him.\u201d\n\nIn Iowa, a state that had never elected a women to Congress, women split their votes evenly, 49 percent to 49 percent, between Joni Ernst and the Democrat, Rep. Bruce Braley, while Ernst swept men\u2019s votes by 18 points.\n\nIn Georgia, North Carolina, and Louisiana, where Democrats had female candidates, Burning Glass suggested Republicans stay away from aggressively negative ads and instead feature Michelle Nunn, Kay Hagan, and Mary Landrieu\u2019s own words supporting President Obama, who was unpopular in those states among the women who were likely to turn out in the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cYou let the opponents\u2019 own words work against them,\u201d O\u2019Connor said of the strategy. \u201cTherefore, we\u2019re not attacking her, we\u2019re saying, \u2018Here\u2019s where she stands, here\u2019s what she\u2019s saying.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen all of the votes were counted, Republicans nationwide lost women voters by four points, but the results were a sea change from the party\u2019s 11-point rout in 2012.\n\nBut Gage and O\u2019Connor are cautioning Republicans not to read so much into their victories this cycle that they assume voters, especially women, will give the party the same results as they did in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re going to have a woman running for president on the other side and that it\u2019s a presidential year, all of these are going to make 2016 more challenging than it was in 2014,\u201d Gage said. \u201cSo we hope that people in our party will continue to pay attention to this.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:39.815+0000"}

But this fall, Mitch McConnell\u2019s magical ride\u2014winning two county-wide races in the Democratic stronghold of Louisville before transforming Blue Kentucky into a reddish hue of purple through five U.S. Senate election cycles\u2014will come to an abrupt halt.\n\nYes, you read it here first\u2014I\u2019m picking the long-shot filly in the most important Kentucky political horse race in a generation: On November 4, 2014, Alison Lundergan Grimes will be elected Kentucky\u2019s next U.S. senator.\n\nDismiss me at your risk as a biased handicapper: While this recovering politician is an unapologetic Democrat, I\u2019ve long held a deep, begrudging respect for McConnell\u2019s unprecedented dominance of my home state\u2019s politics. And just last April, after a Democratic-insider-led putsch helped nudge actress Ashley Judd out of a McConnell challenge, I suggested that the rising star Grimes would be foolish to take on our senior senator\u2014whose unrelentingly brutal campaigns had helped end the political careers of four of his five Senate opponents.\n\nBut Grimes\u2019 brand of chutzpah and moxie proved prescient. And as the general election campaign launches Wednesday, the young secretary of state is ideally situated to pull off what had long been considered a highly improbable victory.\n\nOne reason that I\u2019m so early to declare victory is that, for a relative political newcomer, Grimes has been running a steadfastly solid campaign. Her slingshot cash collection has maintained stride with fundraising\u2019s Goliath, even besting McConnell\u2019s impressive haul in the most recent quarter. Grimes has grown, moreover, as a dynamic and disciplined candidate, benefitting greatly from the tutelage of two of the nation\u2019s top political consultants, media maestro Mark Putnam and polling wizard Mark Mellman.\n\nCertainly, Grimes has frustrated local wags by dodging tough questioning; but she\u2019s wise to starve the 24/7 political attack-and-distort beast, a lesson in restraint that McConnell has expertly modeled for decades. And while she\u2019s angered liberals with her pro-coal mining rhetoric (she most recently decried the coal divestment movement emergent on college campuses), there are scant few lefties who won\u2019t relish the opportunity to replace President Obama\u2019s chief antagonist with a loud female voice for passionate, progressive positions on the minimum wage, reproductive rights, equal pay for equal work, and anti-discrimination for LGBTs.\n\nThe $50 million question, of course, is how Grimes will hold up under the expected record-setting attack ad onslaught that the McConnell campaign and their barely uncoordinated SuperPACs will unleash in the coming weeks\u2026or perhaps over the next few hours. Like her role model, Hillary Clinton, this lady is a champ: equipped with a dogged toughness and a willingness to take\u2014and exchange\u2014punches with the political heavyweights.\n\nGrimes has angered liberals with her pro-coal mining rhetoric, but there are scant few lefties who won\u2019t relish the opportunity to replace President Obama\u2019s chief antagonist.\n\nEven more promising, all of Mitch\u2019s early jabs have missed their target. McConnell\u2019s well-honed brand of seek-and-destroy politics is finding slippery footing in a fight against a much younger woman: Early efforts to paint Grimes as an \u201cempty dress\u201d and an \u201cObama girl\u201d were met with bipartisan outrage from a sexism-sensitive chattering class.\n\nIn fact, to date, most all of Team Mitch\u2019s efforts have been uncharacteristically underwhelming. Kentucky\u2019s champion campaigner hasn\u2019t exactly ventured into Todd Akin or Christine O\u2019Donnell territory, but with mistake after misstep, the McConnell machine has been sputtering under a paucity of cylinders, earning exasperated criticism for awkward rifle-lifting photo-ops, over-reacting press blockades, and\u2014heaven forbid in our hoops-addicted Commonwealth\u2014Duke basketball-celebrating campaign ads.\n\nI\u2019ve joked that this unexpected incompetence was a sign that McConnell was pulling a Bulworth and trying to throw the election. But in sober reality, while Mitch\u2019s past campaigns have been managed by top professionals\u2014many with deep personal loyalties to the Minority Leader\u2014his 2014 bid is being run by a newcomer to top-tier politics, whose heart might not really be in the race.\n\nThe decision to hire Ron and Rand Paul confidante and family member Jesse Benton as Team Mitch\u2019s campaign manager was greeted initially as a bold strategic move to blunt Tea Party primary opposition. But after a recording surfaced of Benton stating that he was \u201cholding my nose\u201d while working for the establishment icon\u2014and then after McConnell\u2019s refusal to fire or even discipline him for insubordination\u2014it seemed as if the senior senator was being held hostage by insurgent forces that lack the professionalism and experience to win the most highly watched, and likely the most expensive, race in the country. And even though the primary is finally in the books, it\u2019s unlikely that McConnell will incur the Wrath of Tea\u2014or more significantly, the ire of his uncomfortable ally, Rand Paul\u2014by pushing Benton to the curb.\n\nIndeed, with polls showing the general election matchup as a dead heat, the Minority Leader\u2019s salvation must come from the 35 or so percent of GOP primary voters who shunned Mitch for businessman and Tea Party favorite Matt Bevin. His advocates passionately argue that ultra-conservatives will obviously choose the mere-conservative, instead of the fellow-Democratic-traveler of the most unpopular president in modern Kentucky history.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s a mistake to characterize anti-Mitch Republicans as an ideological force. Bevin captured more than a third of the primary vote despite being dramatically outspent, despite failing to distinguish himself from McConnell on any substantive policy matter, and despite suffering a near complete campaign implosion due to self-inflicted mini-scandals: from exaggerating his affiliation to MIT, to being exposed as a pro-TARP bailout letter signatory, to worst of all, getting caught lying about knowingly attending a cockfighting rally.\n\nMuch of the explanation is personal\u2014the reserved, sometimes prickly politico has never been well-liked. But Mitch\u2019s true vulnerability can be found in the one strain of Kentucky politics that\u2019s even more powerful than our socially conservative world view:\n\nWe hate Washington.\n\nKentuckians have long held a visceral resentment toward any outsider elite, be they meddling D.C. politicians or snooty Duke basketball players. It\u2019s a cultural phenomenon so deep and toxic that it effectively bound Kentucky to the Confederate cause after the Civil War ended, and it helps explain why so many Bluegrass State voters oppose \u201cbig government\u201d programs like Obamacare that have proven wildly successful in our poor state.\n\nRand Paul\u2019s rocketing career trajectory is Exhibit A of this pervasive mindset. Paul\u2019s secret among Commonwealth voters is not his libertarian dogma, but rather his ability to tap cunningly into the state\u2019s aversion to elitist power in both parties. Indeed, in 2010, he launched from nowhere to the heights of the national political scene by handily defeating his opponent by successfully tarring him as the hand-picked candidate of the leader of the GOP establishment: Mitch McConnell.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the rub: When it comes to our deeply unpopular, polarized and paralyzed system of American government\u2014when national polls show congressional approval lower than that of cockroaches and Brussels sprouts\u2014Mitch McConnell is to many swing Kentucky voters the very symbol of everything that\u2019s wrong with politics. And that\u2019s why on Election Day, the power and the insider status that Mitch McConnell has painstakingly accrued over his long and extraordinarily successful political career will prove to be his ultimate undoing.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:40.349+0000"}

The Times says that\u2019s pure paranoia.\n\nDoes The New York Times harbor an institutional bias against the Clintons, prompting the country\u2019s most influential newspaper to accentuate the negative and minimize the positive in portraying one of America\u2019s more powerful political families?\n\nOf course not, says Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet.\n\n\u201cIf you look at this reasonably, there is no institutional animus toward the Clintons. I don\u2019t buy it,\u201d Baquet told The Daily Beast. \u201cI say this with all due respect to the Clintons, but politicians as a rule like to deflect criticism by blaming the press.\u201d\n\nYet it is a remarkably durable accusation, going back at least to the early 1990s, when Times investigative reporter Jeff Gerth\u2014at the behest of then-Washington bureau chief Howell Raines\u2014uncorked his much-debated 1992 \u201cWhitewater\u201d opus, an exhaustive account of ethically problematic real estate and business dealings that ultimately led, after many improbable twists and turns, to a criminal referral, an independent counsel, and President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment.\n\nRaines, who was named the Times\u2019s editorial page editor as the Clinton administration began in 1993, subsequently unleashed a torrent of scorching commentaries against the president and his activist-wife over the next eight years.\n\n\u201cDoes anybody claim anything to the contrary?\u201d demanded fierce Hillary Clinton defender James Carville, the longtime family friend and strategist who steered Bill Clinton to victory in 1992.\n\nThe late Times columnist William Safire, a former Richard Nixon speechwriter who famously called the first lady \u201ca congenital liar,\u201d also figures prominently in the pro-Clinton narrative. It claims Safire held special sway with Times publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. and, after independent counsel Ken Starr indicated in February 1997 that he was quitting the Clinton investigation to become dean of Pepperdine University Law School in Malibu, browbeat Starr into staying on and continuing to pursue his quarry.\n\nMonica Lewinsky soon became globally infamous.\n\nNearly two decades later, diehard Clinton loyalists are reviving the anti-Times charge with a vengeance now that Hillary Rodham Clinton is the frontrunner in the Democratic nomination race\u2014and The Times is subjecting the candidate to withering (occasionally flawed) scrutiny for her email practices, the sticky foreign entanglements of the Clinton family foundation, and other supposed vulnerabilities.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Times report about right-wing guerrilla videographer James O\u2019Keefe allegedly catching two senior Clinton staffers accepting an illegal campaign donation from a foreigner will do nothing to disabuse the Clintonites of their enmity.\n\n\u201cDoes anybody claim anything to the contrary?\u201d demanded fierce Hillary Clinton defender James Carville, the longtime family friend and strategist who steered Bill Clinton to victory in 1992, referring to the Times\u2019s perceived prejudice. \u201cIs there a sane person who says, \u2018No, they don\u2019t\u2019? It\u2019s like people claiming there\u2019s no climate change. You can find somebody, but it would be very hard to find somebody who doesn\u2019t work there.\u201d\n\nIn a highly unusual July 28 open letter to Baquet, more than 2,000 words long and posted on the campaign website, Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri went on the attack, complaining bitterly about the paper\u2019s \u201capparent abandonment of standard journalistic practices\u201d in covering an official government inquiry into the candidate\u2019s use of a private email server while working as secretary of state.\n\nAs Public Editor Margaret Sullivan acknowledged in a searing recap of the fiasco, The Times\u2019s handling of the above-the-fold, front-page blockbuster \u201cwas, to put it mildly, a mess\u201d\u2014initially suggesting that Clinton was the focus of a criminal referral to the Justice Department before changing the story, without alerting readers, to reflect that, no, she wasn\u2019t being targeted and it was a \u201csecurity,\u201d not a criminal, inquiry concerning the State Department\u2019s email management procedures.\n\n\u201cI think we made a mistake and they called us on it,\u201d Baquet said about Palmieri\u2019s letter. \u201cI think we did what good news organizations do. We corrected it, we wrote an editor\u2019s note, I publicly said it was a mistake to the public editor. I said it to Jen Palmieri, and I said it to everybody who asked. It\u2019s a mistake.\u201d\n\nDefending the Times\u2019s overall coverage of candidate Clinton as \u201cfair,\u201d Baquet added: \u201cI think if you did an anthropological study of how we made the mistake, the mistake had nothing to do with the Clintons. The mistake had to do with some sloppiness on deadline.\u201d\n\nYet some Clintonites remain deeply suspicious of The Times; the Clintons themselves don\u2019t bother to conceal their resentment of the paper, both claiming inaccurately in their respective autobiographies, My Life (Bill) and Living History (Hillary) that The Times either completely ignored an official 1995 report backing their account of losing money in the Whitewater mess (Bill) or devoted only \u201ca few paragraphs\u201d to it (Hillary), while the paper actually published four different stories\u2014one more than 1,700 words long.\n\nClinton ally Joe Conason, editor of the liberal-leaning National Memo website and co-author of an e-book, The Hunting of Hillary, told The Daily Beast: \u201cYou have to think there\u2019s some institutional imperative at work\u2026 Having screwed up something like Whitewater as badly as they did, they think, \u2018We\u2019re going to show what these people [the Clintons] are like\u2014they\u2019re full of conflicts, of self-serving deals, cutting corners, and now we have opportunities to show that and we\u2019re going to get those stories, write them, and go after them.\u2019\u201d\n\nGerth and Raines reject Conason\u2019s assertion that The Times \u201cscrewed up\u201d the Whitewater story, and Raines calls his former Washington bureau staffer\u2014a Pulitzer Prize-winner who left The Times in 2006 and currently works for ProPublica\u2014\u201cone of the best investigative reporters ever.\u201d\n\nGerth, who also broke the story of Hillary Clinton\u2019s $1,000 investment that miraculously grew to $100,000 by trading cattle futures, resulting in the first lady\u2019s famous \u201cPink Press Conference\u201d\u2014emailed: \u201cThe stories I did more than two decades ago, on Whitewater and the commodity trades by Mrs. Clinton, speak for themselves and have stood the test of time.\u201d\n\nThe same year that he wrote those stories about the Clintons, Gerth published critical exposes on Vice President Dan Quayle\u2019s privileged draft record and the rewarding business deals of President George H.W. Bush\u2019s family members.\n\nBut longtime Clinton sympathizer Gene Lyons\u2014Conason\u2019s co-author as well as a columnist for The Arkansas Times and the National Memo\u2014emailed: \u201cI think it\u2019s abundantly clear that the NYT has some kind of institutional Jones against both Clintons, and pretty much has ever since they came on the national scene. A lot of people in Arkansas think it has to do with simple snobbery about Bill Clinton\u2019s origins. Others speculate that Howell Raines saw him as a rival. I have no idea.\u201d\n\nRaines, who served briefly as executive editor and left The Times 12 years ago amid the Jayson Blair scandal, retorted: \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely false and indeed paranoid to think that the institution is hard-wired against the Clintons and, frankly, to trace it back to me.\u201d\n\nThe Alabama-born Raines, who while working in The Times\u2019s Atlanta bureau wrote an admiring front-page trend story touting Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton as a progressive New South politician, also dismissed another popular Clintonite theory\u2014that, as a fellow Southerner of the same generation, \u201cI was jealous of his success. But I thought I\u2019d had a pretty good career at that time.\u201d\n\nAnother popular Clintonite theory\u2014\u201cpeddled by [former Washington Post reporter and Clinton White House aide] Sidney Blumenthal in Washington and New York,\u201d according to Raines\u2014is that The Times has long been trying to redeem itself with Clinton scandal coverage after the institutionally traumatizing humiliation of being beaten by The Post on the Watergate scandal. Blumenthal declined to comment for this article.\n\nRaines recalled that his first tough editorial concerning the Clinton presidency didn\u2019t appear until several months into the first term, when President Clinton, deferring to then-Speaker of the House Tom Foley, broke an election-year promise to push campaign finance reform.\n\nLyons, meanwhile, added: \u201cGiven the NYT Washington Bureau\u2019s general performance since 1992, when I started really paying attention, I\u2019ve sometimes wondered if it hasn\u2019t fallen into the hands of a succession of ambitious sociopaths.\u201d\n\nIn the Clinton cosmology, current Times Washington bureau chief Carolyn Ryan\u2014who didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment\u2014is, if not a sociopath, certainly ambitious.\n\nConason, in a recent column, attacked Ryan\u2014\u201cwhose personal hostility to [Hillary] Clinton is widely known in the capital,\u201d he claimed without offering evidence\u2014for bragging to Public Editor Sullivan that the paper\u2019s \u201cextraordinary and world-beating [campaign] coverage,\u201d as Ryan put it, had been featured on the conservative-leaning Drudge Report, among other sites.\n\n\u201cIs a blurb on Drudge the standard by which we are now to judge the New York Times?\u201d Conason wrote. \u201cSomewhere the paper\u2019s late, great journalists are whirling in their graves at warp speed.\u201d\n\nConason and others said certain unidentified Times reporters have privately expressed concern about the Washington bureau chief\u2019s championing of aggressive, occasionally damaging reporting about the Democratic frontrunner, especially the recent stories about the candidate\u2019s private email server, bylined by Michael Schmidt\u2014another favorite target of the Clintonites\u2014who co-authored the July 23 front-page story that erroneously suggested, before a series of embarrassing corrections and an agonizing bout of Times self-reflection, that Hillary Clinton was the focus of a criminal investigation.\n\nA second Clinton ally, who declined to be quoted by name, described the paper as \u201ca house divided\u201d over Ryan\u2019s leadership of the bureau. Carville, for one, told The Daily Beast: \u201cI do not know the woman, but it is certainly true that Ms. Ryan internally is quite a polarizing figure, I think it\u2019s safe to say.\u201d\n\nBaquet, a staunch defender of Ryan, fired back: \u201cWhat I would say to my fellow Louisianan, James Carville, is that, being a pundit, he likes to opine about things when he doesn\u2019t know anything about them. It\u2019s not true. It\u2019s ridiculous. Politicians are always looking for some subterranean reason why people want to go after their candidate.\u201d\n\nBaquet makes no apologies for The Times\u2019s exhaustive and sometimes critical coverage of candidate Clinton, including this August 31 Page A15 report on her freshly released emails from the State Department.\n\n\u201cThe Clintons have been in the public spotlight for a long, long, long time, and there\u2019s bound to have been some investigative reporting that they don\u2019t like during that period,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the campaign, now she is the Democratic frontrunner in a small field of Democrats\u2014and the Republicans have a ginormous field. And if you look at the way coverage works, she is going to get more attention\u2026 She also has a long, long, complex record to be scrutinized.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s public career as first lady, New York senator, 2008 presidential candidate and secretary of state, Baquet said, \u201cbegs for a tremendous amount of scrutiny and questioning.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:41.087+0000"}

But at what cost?\n\nLikely Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul found himself out in the wilderness of his own party on Wednesday, following President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba. Paul first quietly flailed for cover, before publicly stating his support for lifting the embargo the next day.\n\nWhile libertarians, who make up much of the junior Kentucky Senator\u2019s base of supporters, have long-supported ending the 50-year embargo, establishment Republicans, who Paul needs in order to succeed in the party\u2019s presidential primaries, feel quite differently.\n\nThe only words he had on the subject were bland at best: \u201cIn the past, Senator Paul has stated that he believes in more trade not less, and that includes Cuba,\u201d a Paul spokesman told The Daily Beast. \u201cPeace through commerce is one of Senator Paul\u2019s firm beliefs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the goal is regime change, it sure doesn't seem to be working and probably it punishes the people more than the regime.\u201d\n\nThat sounds a lot like he supports Obama\u2019s pledge to work to lift the embargo, but saying as much would be bad politics ahead of the Republican primary. Paul seemed reluctant to say anything further.\n\n\u201cSorry I can't give you more, but at this time our office has no comment,\u201d his spokesman, Sergio Gor, said.\n\nHowever by Thursday morning, Paul had found his footing. On News Talk 800 WVHU with Tom Roten in Huntington, W. Va., , he stated, matter-of-factly: \u201cThe 50-year embargo just hasn't worked. \u2026 If the goal is regime change, it sure doesn't seem to be working and probably it punishes the people more than the regime because the regime can blame the embargo for hardship. \u2026 In the end, I think opening up Cuba is probably a good idea.\u201d\n\nIt's not difficult to understand why Paul was initially reluctant to voice his beliefs on the matter, seeing as the rest of the likely Republican presidential candidates were sprinting in the opposite direction.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida, whose Cuban parents fled the revolution, spent much of Monday morning campaigning against Obama's decision, going as far as to say he would block the move in Congress.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, another likely 2016 contender whose father was born in Cuba, said the policy would be remembered as a \u201ctragic mistake.\u201d\n\nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush, who on Tuesday announced that he would \u201cactively explore\u201d jumping into the GOP primary, has vocally opposed lifting the embargo, and argued instead that, \u201cWe should consider strengthening it.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Texas Governor Rick Perry have not responded to requests for comment from The Daily Beast.\n\nWhile Paul\u2019s position on the embargo puts him at odds with his party and in sync with its Enemy In Chief, it does give him credibility among the libertarian base that propelled him into the Senate in 2010.\n\nThe libertarian Cato Institute, for instance, declared it was \u201cTime to End the Cuba Embargo\u201d back in 2012, saying that it had \u201cfailed to liberate the Cuban people\u201d and that the policy itself \u201cobviously has failed.\u201d\n\nAnd Paul\u2019s father, libertarian icon, former Texas congressman, and two-time presidential candidate Ron Paul, has long been a vocal opponent of the embargo. In 2012, he went as far as to defend Beyonce\u2019s and Jay-Z\u2019s decision to vacation in Cuba.\n\nPaul\u2019s supporters, many of whom he inherited from his father, have previously expressed fears that he would do just about anything to win, even if it meant compromising the sometimes unorthodox beliefs that garnered him fans in the first place. His decision to stick to his convictions on Thursday is no doubt positive news for them.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:41.315+0000"}

Six Senate seats is a lot, after all. And with seven days to go until the election, any number of factors could go against the GOP, allowing the Democrats to retain control, if by the slimmest of margins. What happens then?\n\nWhen asked about that scenario, one top GOP fundraiser, who has raised money for Mitt Romney and a host of Republican congressional candidates over the last several election cycles simply paused for several seconds, as if time was needed to merely wrap one\u2019s head around such a dire outcome.\n\n\u201cIt would be an unbelievable disaster. The party would be devastated. The fundraising would dry-up. It would just become suddenly non-existent.\u201d\n\nMaking matters worse, Republicans say, is not just that enthusiasm for the party heading into 2016 would be diminished, but that the divisions within the GOP, which have simmered on a low boil for four years now (flaring up during the government shutdown and debt-ceiling face off) would at last break out into all-out civil war.\n\nIn 2010 and 2012, Republicans also seemed poised to pick up a handful of seats. But with the Tea Party at full power, a number of fringe candidates won GOP primaries, depriving the party of easy opportunities to knock off Democrats. In 2014, party elders decided that the nation had seen enough of the Christine \u201cI am not a witch\u201d O\u2019Donnells and Todd \u201cLegitimate Rape\u201d Akins, and tried to keep the firebrands at bay.\n\nThey were largely successful, with every Republican incumbent or establishment candidate winning his or her primary. Even the Senate\u2019s incumbent Tea Partiers, like Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah played good soldier, stumping for their embattled establishment colleagues or at least keeping mostly muzzled as their one-time allies among the conservative grassroots fought the establishment.\n\n\u201cIf you are looking for a scenario where Ted Cruz becomes the Republican nominee, it is out of the ashes of the 2014 midterms.\u201d\n\nBut the Tea Partiers and grassroots groups will be looking for blood\u2014even after following orders and standing down in 2014\u2014the GOP doesn\u2019t retake the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt would be like Lucy taking away the football again,\u201d said one GOP establishment operative, who is working with several Senate candidates this fall and so did not want to be seen publicly discussing the possibility of a loss. \u201cIt all came together for us. We got all the right people, no one said anything stupid. This would definitely not put us on the right trajectory heading into 2016. It would demand a civil war.\u201d\n\nFor the Tea Party wing of the party, a loss next Tuesday would have one obvious culprit: a GOP establishment that forgets to excite the base, which interfered in local elections, and which ran \u201cDemocrat-lite\u201d candidates instead of opting for bold contrasts.\n\nFor the establishment wing, this would be precisely the wrong lesson. It is, after all, they say, hard to imagine that the GOP would be performing better now if instead of Thom Tillis carrying the Republican banner in North Carolina, the party nominated his former primary foe Greg Brannon, who once compared food stamps to slavery. Or if in Georgia, instead of the mild-manner businessman David Perdue, Congressman Paul Broun, who once accused President Obama of preparing to institute a Marxist dictatorship, secured the GOP nod.\n\nInstead, establishment GOP figures say that if the party had not had these and other primary nuisances, they would have been able to put their firepower on the Democrats even earlier. They point to primary challenges in Kansas, Kentucky and Louisiana in which either the Republican incumbent or the establishment pick still has not fully regained his footing.\n\nAnd they know that whatever the result next week, the Tea Parties will cite the results as proof that if the GOP had shown more backbone, they would have won even more seats.\n\n\u201cI know the Tea Party guys will be saying at the end of this, \u2018We could have 64 seats if only we had picked Chris McDaniel! If only we had gone with Milton Wolf!\u201d said Rick Wilson, a GOP strategist. \u201cAnd my response is \u2018Crack kills. Consider rehab.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile scenarios where the party takes seven seats are a lot easier to map, there is still a chance for the Democrats to hold on. It involves winning in GOP-friendly states like Kentucky and Georgia, and the more advanced Democratic ground game coming through in places like Colorado and Iowa. Frustratingly for Republicans, this scenario would be reliant also on some weirdness that was not predictable at the start of the midterm season, like the rise of independent candidacies in Kansas and South Dakota, and the emergence of third-party candidates in states that should be easy wins like Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nWhat Republicans fear most is that a 2014 loss will provide a major boost to some Tea Party figures as the party gets set to hold its nominating primaries for president. Those like Bobby Jindal, Chris Christie and Jeb Bush who have urged the party to broaden its appeal will find little enthusiasm for their arguments, while hardliners like Cruz or Mike Huckabee become party saviors.\n\n\u201cIf you are looking for a scenario where Ted Cruz becomes the Republican nominee, it is out of the ashes of the 2014 midterms,\u201d said one party insider.\n\nBut of course, should the GOP hold on, it still means that the party faces major challenges heading into a presidential election year. This is why some Republicans have the opposite concern: that a win in 2014 will merely paper over the party\u2019s weaknesses in a way that a loss would force them to address. Namely, the concern that winning a midterm in a slew of white, conservative-leaning states will mean that Republicans will cease attempting to broaden the coalition to include more minorities, women, and young people.\n\n\u201cWhether we take back the Senate or not, the same questions will need to be answered, \u201c said Brian Walsh, a former spokesman for the National Republican Senate Committee. \u201cThe party is still going to need to address the long term question of how do we grow the party.

The group couldn\u2019t be more pleased.\n\nPlanned Parenthood gained an unlikely new booster on Tuesday morning: Republican front-runner Donald Trump.\n\nThe billionaire told Chris Cuomo on CNN\u2019s New Day that he opposes federal funding going to Planned Parenthood to pay for abortions, but that he\u2019s OK with tax dollars going to the group to pay for other services that it provides.\n\n\u201cThe problem that I have with Planned Parenthood is the abortion situation. It is like an abortion factory, frankly,\u201d Trump began. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t have it. And you just shouldn\u2019t be funding it. That should not be funded by the government, and I feel strongly about that.\u201d\n\nThen Cuomo asked Trump if he could support funding for other Planned Parenthood efforts, such as providing contraception to women.\n\n\u201cWhat I would do when the time came, I\u2019d look at the individual things they do, and maybe some of the individual things they do are good,\u201d Trump continued, with characteristic eloquence. \u201cI know a lot of the things are bad. But certainly the abortion aspect of it should not be funded by government, absolutely.\u201d\n\nAnd he went on: \u201cI would look at the good aspects of [Planned Parenthood], and I would also look, because I\u2019m sure they do some things properly and good and that are good for women, and I would look at that, and I would look at other aspects also. But we have to take care of women.\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s the thing: As NPR detailed last week, federal law prevents the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions in virtually all cases.\n\nPlanned Parenthood gets federal money through the Title X family planning program\u2014none of those funds can be used to pay for abortions\u2014and through Medicaid, which can cover the cost of abortions only \u201cin very restricted cases.\u201d\n\nSo, in short, Trump defended the status quo: half a billion dollars of taxpayer cash for the group.\n\nPlanned Parenthood applauded Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump seems to have realized that banning all abortions, shutting down the government, and defunding Planned Parenthood are extreme positions that are way too far outside the mainstream for even him to take,\u201d said spokesman Eric Ferrero in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the rest of the GOP field will wake up and reconsider their extreme and unpopular positions on defunding preventive care, abortion bans, and the other economic issues that women and their families care about,\u201d Ferrero continued.\n\nIn other words, Trump is Planned Parenthood\u2019s favorite Republican presidential candidate right now (or their least un-favorite).\n\n\u201cDonald Trump seems to have realized that banning all abortions, shutting down the government, and defunding Planned Parenthood are extreme positions that are way too far outside the mainstream for even him to take,\u201d said Planned Parenthood spokesman Eric Ferrero in a statement.\n\nWhile the billionaire\u2019s comments have pleased the one side of the debate, they have predictably left pro-life activists angry and frustrated. That\u2019s because when pro-life activists talk about defunding Planned Parenthood, they aren\u2019t talking about that tiny exception in Medicaid; they\u2019re talking about zeroing out all taxpayer dollars that the organization receives.\n\nThey argue that any dollar that goes to the organization is, ultimately, supporting abortion.\n\n\u201c[B]ecause money is fungible, subsidizing any of the operations of the nation\u2019s largest performer of abortions (rather than re-routing that money to community health centers not engaged in abortions) is a boon to the merchants of death,\u201d wrote Dan McLaughlin at the conservative site RedState a few hours after Trump made his comments.\n\n(This isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s first clash with RedState. Last week, RedState Founder Erick Erickson disinvited Trump from a weekend confab for Republican contenders after Trump\u2019s comments about Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly.)\n\nMallory Quigley, communications director for the pro-life political group Susan B. Anthony List, echoed McLaughlin\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cWe have always opposed federal funding for Planned Parenthood because they are America\u2019s largest abortion business and any dollars that they receive free up other funding, which is available for abortion,\u201d Quigley told The Daily Beast.\n\nFederal tax dollars make up a huge part of the monies Planned Parenthood gets every year. In 2014, the organization received $528.4 million from the federal government. In contrast, it only took in $54.7 million in fees charged for services. The remainder of its funding for that year\u2014about $563 million\u2014came from nongovernment sources, private donors, and foundations.\n\nLosing taxpayer funding can impact the organization\u2019s effectiveness\u2014a scenario that has played out on the state level.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Wisconsin was forced to close five clinics\u2014none of which performed abortions, per the group\u2019s spokesperson\u2014after Gov. Scott Walker signed budgets eliminating its state funding.\n\nChris Taylor, a Wisconsin state representative and former public policy director at Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, told The Daily Beast that any further state funding cuts\u2014including losing access to federal Title X dollars\u2014\u201cwill certainly put more clinics at risk.\u201d\n\nFor pro-life activists, fewer clinics would be\u2014and has been\u2014a big win. So Trump\u2019s defense of federal funding for the organizations baffled pro-life activists who spoke with The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what he was thinking when he said that, to be honest with you,\u201d said Kerri Kupec of the conservative Christian group Alliance Defending Freedom.\n\n\u201cTo say, let\u2019s keep funding the quote unquote good aspects\u2014why are we making Americans and their hard-earned tax dollars complicit in this gross behavior that Planned Parenthood is engaging in, this callous disregard for human life?\u201d she added.\n\nOthers piled on too.\n\n\u201cAll his bankruptcies taught Donald Trump about such cheap accounting tricks,\u201d said John Zmirak, a pro-life columnist for the Christian news aggregation site The Stream. \u201cPlanned Parenthood is a criminal enterprise with roots in racist eugenics. If Trump wants taxpayers to subsidize their baby organ profiteering, he should be man enough to admit it.\u201d\n\nAnd Lila Rose, a prominent pro-life activist and head of the group Live Action, said Trump must not have watched the sting videos that renewed interest in defunding the organization.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s vacillation on Planned Parenthood funding is deeply troubling, and reveals an ignorance about their horrific abortion practices,\u201d she said.\n\nStill more activists have been left scratching their heads.\n\nPenny Nance, who heads the group Concerned Women for America, emailed that she plans to ask him to clarify whether he supports shifting Planned Parenthood funds to community health centers that don\u2019t provide abortions, or whether he supports the status quo.\n\nThe Trump camp didn\u2019t respond to a request for clarification from The Daily Beast.\n\nAnd Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Iowa social conservative who heads The Family Leader, said his group \u201cwill probably want to discuss it with him further.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like a boys and girls home family services-type-deal that, well, we\u2019ve discovered that these boys and girls are being physically abused, but hey, they\u2019re all getting their GEDs, so let\u2019s keep funding them getting their GED,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, if you\u2019re doing wrong, you\u2019re doing wrong.

The state is already suffering from climate change\u2014the president needs to be an advocate for the Arctic.\n\nAlaska is a different sort of state. It is isolated from the Lower 48, but as home to some of the most crucial ecosystems of our planet, Alaska has a deep-seated connection with nature that makes us unique. It is because of Alaska that the United States is considered an Arctic Nation, so indeed; the Arctic connects us all.\n\nWhich is why President Obama\u2019s visit here is such a big deal. Not only because we\u2019re often overlooked by politicians who focus on the Lower 48, but also because we\u2019re on the front lines of climate change. Unsurprisingly, as an Arctic state, warming is hitting us hard. Whether it\u2019s the deficit of water in the summer as less snow falls over winter, resulting in record-breaking wildfires, or the shifting of the very ground below our feet as permafrost melts, Alaska is a state with perhaps the most to lose from rising temperatures.\n\nThe changes are happening at an alarming rate, but even beyond the practical concerns of infrastructure at risk from the melt or water worries, Alaska\u2019s climate carries real meaning for its people. As Gwich\u2019in Athabascan women and mothers we carry with us the responsibility to maintain our vibrant culture for our children and our children\u2019s children. In order for this to happen we need healthy lands, waters, and intact ecosystems to be protected. For those of us living a subsistence lifestyle, the protection of Alaskan lands and waters is also a human-rights issue.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s official recommendation of a Wilderness designation for the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was a huge step in the right direction\u2014the sort of strong action that we need to see more of from leaders across the globe. Alas, it is only a \u201crecommendation\u201d and stronger protections are needed immediately to counter the rush for resources that is taking place all over the Arctic.\n\n\n\nWhile fossil-fuel corporations look at the wilderness of Alaska\u2019s land and water and see a profit to be made, we see a people to protect. We depend on the bounty of what lives here to stay alive, be it the porcupine caribou herds migrating across the plains or the schools of fish in the oceans. And sadly, warming threatens these species, which have, for hundreds of thousands of years, adapted to the (now-thawing) frigid Arctic temperatures. Like the animals that sustain us, the Alaskan people and our culture are built for an Arctic climate. That\u2019s what makes the climate fight so important to us.\n\nSo it\u2019s thrilling to know that more indigenous peoples are joining the climate cause. Last year, for example, frontline native communities featured prominently in the People\u2019s Climate March, the biggest climate protest to date. Building on that success is the People\u2019s Climate Movement, which is doubling down on its efforts to make it clear that climate change is far more than just an environmental issue; it\u2019s also a social-justice issue, as low-income communities bear a disproportionate burden of climate effects.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the movement unique. It\u2019s not focused on a single group, but on bringing together the many diverse voices, so we can stand together for a common cause. After all, though there are many peoples on this planet, there\u2019s just one atmosphere. And unfortunately, it needs all our help. Because though we sometimes feel isolated, Alaskans alone can\u2019t stop climate change.\n\nWe hope that Obama hears firsthand from our Alaska Native communities the impacts we are facing due to climate change and that he takes this visit as an opportunity to take further actions. The hardships experienced in Alaska, with unprecedented heat and wildfires, have already begun to echo across America. Our Ancestors knew that in order to survive we had to work together. A culture of caring for one another and deep ecology is necessary if we are truly going to tackle climate change.

{"entityId": 1684, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "One boy with appendicitis was told nothing was \u2018wrong with his ass.\u2019 Another was viciously beaten by guards. And none of those responsible got jail time.\n\nIn 2003, 17-year-old Omar Paisley spent three days in a Florida jail cell moaning in agony. Prison staff said he was faking his illness and told him to suck it up. Then he died.\n\nThis year and last, the deaths of numerous African Americans at the hands or in the custody of prison officials and police\u2014including Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, Walter Scott, Tamir Rice, and, most recently, Sandra Bland \u2014have drawn renewed (and belated) national media attention to the state of the criminal justice system. And that, in turn, has made candidates\u2019 stances and records on criminal justice policy a factor in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nIt\u2019s a particularly sensitive topic for Jeb Bush, who as governor faced two situations that mirror the deaths of Gray and Bland, both of whom died while in police custody. When Bush was governor of Florida, two teenagers died preventable deaths while in juvenile detention centers. And Bush\u2019s approach to their cases casts some light on how he might look at criminal justice issues if he becomes president.\n\nPaisley\u2019s death could have been averted, and it took a long time. The African-American teenager was put in the 226-bed Miami-Dade Regional Juvenile Detention Center \u201cfor cutting another youth with a soda can,\u201d the AP reported, and he filled out a form on June 7\u2014one day after going to the jail\u2014saying he was ill.\n\n\u201cMy stomach hurts really bad,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI don't know what to do. I cand [sic] sleep.\u201d\n\nSome of the staff at the facility, according to a Feb. 27, 2004, USA Today story, didn\u2019t take him seriously.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t nothing wrong with his ass,\u201d said one nurse.\n\nAnd supervisor Jack Harrington told Paisley to \u201csuck it up and walk around.\u201d\n\nBut you can\u2019t suck up appendicitis. The paper reported that a guard later found the teen lying in his cell covered in feces and urine, sweating profusely and clutching his stomach. Nurse Dianne Demeritte refused to enter the cell, saying she didn\u2019t \u201cwant to take his [mess] home to my kid.\u201d ( The Palm Beach Post noted that two of his cellmates had to change his sheets and clean up his vomit.)\n\nDemeritte made the sick teen, who could barely walk, walk out of his filthy cell and sit on a chair in the hallway. She concluded that there was \u201cnothing wrong with his ass.\u201d Then, according to USA Today, she filled out paperwork to have him moved to a hospital, left him sitting on the chair, and went on a break. Guards found him passed out and didn\u2019t perform CPR because their first aid kid didn\u2019t contain the necessary equipment.\n\nThat\u2019s how Omar Paisley died.\n\nBush\u2019s communications director, Jill Bratina, sent that USA Today story to the governor and others a few hours after it was published, according to emails made searchable by the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting .\n\nPaisley\u2019s death became national news, and, in one email, Bush promised a constituent it was just an isolated incident.\n\nBill King of Pensacola emailed the governor to voice his outrage about Paisley\u2019s roommates being forced to clean his vomit from their cell.\n\n\u201cThe lives of those kids are as much if not more important than any employee working there as they are not there by choice as the employees are, they are there by design and they have no say over their own lives,\u201d King wrote.\n\n\u201cAll of these children are important and should not be placed into any dangerous or unhealthy situations,\u201d he added.\n\nBush concurred, and emailed King back to say so.\n\n\u201cThe interim Secretary [of Juvenile Justice] is cleaning up the mess,\u201d the governor replied. \u201cThankfully, this is not a problem that is systemic statewide. I appreciate your writing.\u201d\n\nAnd his assistant general counsel, Wendy Berger, emailed another concerned constituent, Lynda Morse, to promise the governor would do everything he could to ensure that no more incarcerated teens would have to suffer Paisley\u2019s fate.\n\n\u201cLike many throughout this State, Governor Bush was saddened and outraged over the death of this child,\u201d Berger wrote. \u201cPlease know that those responsible will be held accountable. Governor Bush has full confidence in Interim Secretary [C. George] Denman\u2019s ability to implement needed reforms. His hope is that the changes made in the Department will prevent anything like this from ever happening again.\u201d\n\nThose hopes were misplaced. Some leaders at the Department of Juvenile Justice stepped down in the wake of Paisley\u2019s death, and the department implemented a new policy allowing any staffer or volunteer to call 911 without first having to get permission.\n\nBut there was scant accountability for the adults responsible for Paisley\u2019s death. The two nurses were indicted on murder charges, according to The Palm Beach Post , but neither got jail time. Prison Legal News reported that the prosecutors dropped charges against one of them and that the other nurse\u2014the one who forced Paisley to leave his cell and then insisted that nothing was wrong with him\u2014just gave up her nurse\u2019s license and spent one year on probation. Several prison employees were fired, and Paisley\u2019s mother got a $1.45 million settlement from the Department of Juvenile Justice. In the meantime, nonviolent drug offenders in Florida faced stiff prison sentences.\n\n\u201cIn the tragic cases of Omar Paisley and Martin Lee Anderson, Governor Bush took immediate action to hold those individuals involved in these deaths accountable.\u201d\n\nLess than three years after Paisley\u2019s death, 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson\u2014also African-American\u2014died in custody at the Bay County Boot Camp detention center in Panama City, Florida. Anderson landed there because he and a few of his cousins took his grandmother\u2019s car joy-riding and then crashed it, according the book The Boys of the Dark: A Story of Betrayal and Redemption in the Deep South, by Robin Gaby Fisher, Michael O\u2019McCarthy, and Robert W. Straley.\n\n\n\nA video showed seven guards at the boot-camp detention center kicking, kneeing, and hitting the 14-year-old because he wouldn\u2019t run around a track, according to WCTV .\n\n\u201cA medical examiner originally said the teenager died of Sickle Cell trait, but after Anderson\u2019s body was exhumed, a second autopsy revealed he did not die of natural causes,\u201d reported WCTV.\n\nBush appointed the special prosecutor who ordered the second autopsy that found Anderson didn\u2019t die of natural causes. That autopsy \u201cdetermined that by blocking Martin\u2019s mouth and forcing him to inhale ammonia fumes\u2014an effort, the guards said, to revive him\u2014they had caused his vocal cords to spasm and block his airway,\u201d The New York Times reported .\n\nAnderson\u2019s family got a $5 million settlement from the state. An all-white jury acquitted the guards who beat and kneed him on video, Time reported.\n\nLater, Bush signed legislation eliminating juvenile detention boot camps in the state. The New York Times noted that previously, Bush was \u201ca strong supporter\u201d of the boot camps. And during his failed 1994 gubernatorial campaign, he told the Orlando Sentinel that he wanted to \u201creform our juvenile-justice system by emphasizing punishment over therapy for juvenile offenders.\u201d\n\nThe teens\u2019 deaths may have changed his view.\n\n\u201cThroughout Gov. Bush\u2019s tenure, he worked to reform the juvenile justice system in Florida to improve services, help young offenders turn their lives around and give them the tools needed to be successful in the future,\u201d Bush aide Kristy Campbell said via email.\n\nCampbell noted that the juvenile crime rate dropped by 18 percent during Bush\u2019s tenure in office and that the rate of juveniles entering the adult system went down by more than 40 percent.\n\n\u201cIn the tragic cases of Omar Paisley and Martin Lee Anderson, Governor Bush took immediate action to hold those individuals involved in these deaths accountable and to provide additional funding to increase staff and services at juvenile justice facilities,\u201d she added.\n\nThe 911 reforms Bush\u2019s Department of Juvenile Justice implemented after Paisley\u2019s death don\u2019t seem to have outlasted his time in office with complete success. On July 10, 2011, four and a half years after Bush\u2019s departure, another teen, 18-year-old Eric Perez, died in a manner that CBS Miami called \u201chauntingly similar\u201d to Paisley\u2019s. It also recalled Anderson\u2019s death: Guards at the West Palm Beach juvenile detention center where Perez was held roughhoused with him, picking him up and dropping him, before he retreated, hallucinated, passed out, and died.\n\nOne guard said Perez was faking his illness and decided that sending him to a hospital wasn\u2019t worth the paperwork, CBS Miami reported.\n\n\u201c[Superintendent Anthony] Flowers insisted he never \u2018prohibited or discouraged\u2019 staff from calling 911,\u201d the station reported. \u201cBut officers on the scene said they were told the superintendent had ordered staff not to call for help.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough administrators had pledged years earlier to \u2018treat every child as if he was your own,\u2019 detention staff had, once again, neglected a youth to death,\u201d the station continued.\n\nAnd another guard, Floyd Powell, said his superiors specifically told him not to dial 911\u2014even though he feared, correctly, that the worst would happen. He told the Miami Herald that he was later fired for sharing that detail with investigators.\n\nCathy Purvis Lively, the attorney who represented Powell during that time, told The Daily Beast that systemic problems set up Perez\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming concern was staffing,\u201d she said.\n\nCalling 911 meant sending a prison staffer to the hospital along with Perez, and endemic overcrowding and understaffing meant supervisors often hesitated to make the call.\n\n\u201cThere were multiple problems,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the time, I was representing someone who was essentially the scapegoat, the low guy on the totem pole.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the one trying to seek intervention,\u201d she added.\n\nPerez\u2019s death wasn\u2019t unforeshadowed. Dale Dobuler took over the Miami-Dade Regional Juvenile Detention Center after Paisley\u2019s death and watched the rollout of the reforms from Bush\u2019s Department of Juvenile Justice. He quit because he didn\u2019t think he could keep the detainees under his watch safe, as \u201cmany of the protections put in place after Omar\u2019s death already had begun to erode,\u201d according to the Palm Beach Post.\n\nI asked Dobuler if he stands by those comments in retrospect.\n\n\u201cI stand by my comments,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThey were accurate when I made them and remain accurate now\u2014though I obviously now have less insight into the current state of affairs with DJJ. The fact is, in the aftermath of the Paisley tragedy, DJJ was able to put significant resources in place to address some of the systemic issues at Miami (and other detention centers). With time (and less public attention and media scrutiny), those resources were taken away bit by bit as a result of funding concerns. At the time I left in 2008, I was very concerned that no matter how much of a leadership effort I made locally, it was only a matter of time before another tragedy took place that I would not be able to prevent.\u201d\n\nThe failures of Florida\u2019s prison system weren\u2019t unique to Bush\u2019s governorship, as Perez\u2019s death shows. In October 2007, Time detailed a lengthy history of horrific abuse in the state\u2019s prisons that predated Bush. And those kinds of abuses also happen around the country.\n\nAfter the acquittal of the prison guards who watched Anderson die, his parents\u2019 attorney, Benjamin Crump, summed up the verdict this way:", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:42.732+0000"}

But the movies, it seems, are concerned about what\u2019s happening with her.\n\nConsider Divergent. In the film, Kate Winslet plays a character named Jeanine Matthews. Actually, \u201ccharacter\u201d is too weak a word. \u201cVillain\u201d is more like it. The leader of the brainy Erudite clan, Matthews plots to overthrow the reigning Abnegation government and seize power by injecting into the Dauntless faction a computerized serum that transforms the city\u2019s brave defenders into an army of suggestible, sleepwalking drones.

In Neil Blomkamp\u2019s 2013 sci-fi action thriller Elysium, Matt Damon faces off against Delacourt, the Defense Secretary of the titular space habitat\u2014a luxurious colony where the One Percent live in absolute comfort while the citizens of a devastated Earth are oppressed by brutal robots. Like Matthews, Delacourt plots to oust the current leadership (i.e., her boss, President Patel) and take control of the government with the help of advanced computer technology (i.e., program developed by a private defense contractor that can override Elysium\u2019s core systems). She\u2019s also a middle-aged woman with cropped blonde hair, a cool, martial demeanor, and a penchant for pantsuits. And later this year, Julianne Moore will star in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay\u2014Part 1 as President Alma Coin: another cold, calculating, devious, power-hungry, besuited, light-haired woman leader who \u201cwill do whatever it takes to attain her goals.\u201d\n\nUnlike Catwoman, or Alex Forrest, or Sat\u00e1nico Pandemonium\u2014or the vast majority of cinematic bad girls, to be honest\u2014none of them use their sexuality to get what they want.\n\nWhy are all these Hillary Clinton caricatures suddenly showing up on the big screen?

Instead they use power, technology, and intellect.\n\nSummit/Getty\n\nSome critics will say that we should interpret the sudden big-screen appearance of Jeanine Matthews, Secretary Delacourt, and President Alma Coin\u2014leaders who happen to resemble Barack Obama\u2019s likeliest successor\u2014as a sign that we\u2019re still very, very uncomfortable with the prospect of putting a woman in charge. What these movies prove, they will add, is that America is still afraid of women like Clinton. Women who are tough, brilliant, and plainly ambitious. Women who don\u2019t conform to society\u2019s sexual expectations. Women who try to run the world rather than seduce it. We are so stressed out about the havoc these women will wreak on the future, the argument will go, that we\u2019ve begun to subconsciously channel our anxieties into science fiction.\n\nPerhaps. But it\u2019s worth considering whether the opposite may be true instead: that we\u2019re encountering more Clinton clones on screen because we\u2019re actually becoming more comfortable with female leaders off screen. That the rise of the Hillaryesque sci-fi villain is a sign of growth, not statis. Science fiction tends to reflect reality, exaggerating it to make a point. But for most of movie history, an antagonist like Jeanine Matthews would have seemed too far-fetched, even for sci-fi; she wouldn\u2019t have mirrored anything in the real world. Now she does.\n\nAfter all, equality cuts both ways. It used to be that the only political villains we could conjure up were men. Now it\u2019s just as easy to imagine a woman scheming and spinning her way to the top. In its own funny way, that seems like progress.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:43.310+0000"}

As she watched the House GOP melt down, the Democratic Minority Leader had some advice for the Speaker from her own days with the gavel.\n\nNancy Pelosi was in the middle of responding to a question about the CIA director apologizing to Senate Intelligence Committee leaders for hacking into their computers when an aide came in with a note telling her the Republicans had pulled the border resources bill from the House floor.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad enough for their members,\u201d she explained. Relieved the legislation had failed, she said, \u201cThank God, it was so awful,\u201d then adding with an edge of sarcasm, \u201cNow that they\u2019ve done their harm of the day.\u201d\n\nA television monitor tuned to C-SPAN with the sound turned down was behind the House Minority Leader as she took questions from a small group of journalists before Congress adjourns for its five-week district work period, otherwise known as vacation time. Clearly disgusted and frustrated with the GOP-led House, and the partisan fervor that led to the first time ever that the chamber will sue a president, she detailed how the border bill had gone through several iterations, becoming more punitive toward illegal immigrants and ratcheting down its cost in order to attract more GOP votes.\n\nThe ploy didn\u2019t work, or as Pelosi put it, \u201cThey didn\u2019t eat their vegetables.\u201d And that meant Republicans wouldn\u2019t get dessert. A companion bill slated for a vote to defund DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) was shelved. If they\u2019d eaten their vegetables, Republicans would have then voted to strip money from DACA, the program President Obama put in place by executive action in 2012 to allow illegal immigrants under the age of 30 brought to the U.S. as children to remain in the country.\n\nRepublicans who think they have a legitimate beef against Obama for abuse of power probably weren\u2019t in the Congress in 2007 when Pelosi became speaker in a Democratic-controlled House elected on a wave of anti-war fervor. Liberal Democrats wanted to impeach President George W. Bush, but Pelosi took it off the table. Why didn\u2019t she pursue impeachment? \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was right for the American people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were starting our new majority, and the first thing we do is impeach President Bush?\u201d She didn\u2019t think so, saying, \u201cHistory makes its assessment and verdict.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is silly in its context but serious in its purpose, it is not frivolous,\u201d Pelosi says. \u201cThis is the Congress of the United States. C\u2019mon\u2014this is the first branch of government. What are we doing?\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an obvious or easy course for a lifelong liberal who had voted against the Iraq War, which had been pursued on the basis of false intelligence. \u201cI had hundreds of thousands of people in the streets. We voted in the House and Senate to end the war. President Bush vetoed and we didn\u2019t have the votes to override. We had to fund the troops. They are there\u2014we can vote not to send them but they are there.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic House could have defunded the war; that\u2019s how the Vietnam War came to an ignominious close. Pelosi chose not to do that, and some in her party have never forgiven her. \u201cIn a certain segment of the left, I will never recover from that,\u201d she said. Of course she has no regrets, and if Boehner wanted to shut down talk of impeachment in his caucus, he could do that in an instant, she says. \u201cYou just have to say it was off the table, instead of appealing to the wink-and-nod crowd\u201d as he is doing. Asked how she managed the sizable number of progressives in the Democratic caucus, she shot back, \u201cI led\u2026 I led.\u201d\n\nPelosi talked about the \u201copportunity cost\u201d of the House spending its time debating a lawsuit against Obama while legislation awaiting action goes unattended. Pointing to the oil painting of Abraham Lincoln that hangs in her Capitol Hill conference room, she said Lincoln knew public support is everything, and the public is not reacting positively to Boehner\u2019s lawsuit. A Public Policy Polling survey finds only 41 percent of the country believe the suit is legitimate, compared to 51 percent who call it a political stunt.\n\nThe numbers are more lopsided when it comes to the use of taxpayer money to pursue legal action: 56 percent think it\u2019s a bad use; 36 percent say it\u2019s a good use.\n\n\u201cThis is silly in its context but serious in its purpose, it is not frivolous,\u201d Pelosi says. \u201cThis is the Congress of the United States. C\u2019mon\u2014this is the first branch of government. What are we doing?\u201d\n\nAsked if she was secretly smiling since talk of impeachment is rallying Democrats, she insisted, \u201cNo,\u201d then noted that a barrage of money from the grassroots had come in, \u201c74,000 new donors, people we never heard from before, almost spontaneously.\u201d Republicans are energized by talk of impeachment, but so are Democrats. There\u2019s also evidence, Pelosi says, the hyper-partisanship is \u201cturning off the middle. Maybe that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to try to do, out-base us,\u201d she says. \u201cFifty percent of our vote doesn\u2019t even know there\u2019s an election.\u201d\n\nReaching those voters takes more than the Middle Class Jumpstart of worthy policy initiatives that Pelosi champions. It requires something on the scale of an earthquake, which is why impeachment talk is so tantalizing.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:43.453+0000"}
{"entityId": 1689, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "There was a time when the bigoted, Bible-thumping crowd ran roughshod over D.C. Now, not so much.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, the day after winning the election to become the new House Majority Leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA)\u2014tan, grey-haired and neatly dressed\u2014took to the stage at Ralph Reed\u2019s Faith and Freedom Coalition \u2018Road to Majority\u2019 Conference to thank \u201cmy Lord and Savior for his grace, his strength, and for never leaving me.\u201d\n\nThe crowd ate it up\u2014well, what was left of the crowd, anyway.\n\nThe Regency Ballroom inside the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington was barely half-filled by the time McCarthy took the stage around 1:15pm, after a string of speeches by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, former presidential candidate Herman Cain, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, which touched on a range of topics\u2014from the president\u2019s foreign policy, to education, to prison reform, and, of course, abortion.\n\nThe crowd seemed to have dispersed after Christie\u2019s well-received speech, which saw him again use a variation of one of his Greatest Hits: \u201cif you\u2019re pro-life, you have to be pro-life when they leave the womb, too.\u201d A few minutes after Christie finished up, it looked like there had been a fire drill in the ballroom.\n\nThe tables where the event\u2019s sponsors offered pamphlets urging people to \u201cdraft Ben Carson\u201d or \u201cinvestigate Planned Parenthood\u2019s plan\u201d were mostly left unvisited\u2014with vendors practically throwing literature, bumper stickers, and pins at passersby.\n\nHerman Cain walked out on stage wearing a gold, slightly metallic tie. Cain offered Obamacare \u201csucks,\u201d \u201cTea Party is an attitude!\u201d and \u201ca first grader would solve problems a lot smarter than this administration. I\u2019m not saying that to be insulting.\u201d\n\nCain did receive a standing ovation, but there were so few people left in attendance that it looked more like they were idly waiting for a bus.\n\nBut even when the room was filled, something was just lacking. The event brought none of the electricity of the Conservative Political Action Conference, Washington\u2019s premier right-of-center confab. But, perhaps that\u2019s not much of a surprise at all, considering that unlike CPAC\u2014which markets itself to conservatives of all different varieties\u2014the Faith and Freedom Coalition markets itself only to extreme social conservatives.\n\nMaybe Republican celebrities addressing half-empty ballrooms and a thin crowd of angry protesters scaring off observers is it looks like when you're losing the battles and you're losing the war.\n\nA similar vibe surrounded Thursday\u2019s social conservative event, the March for Marriage, meant to celebrate unions between men and women only. Not only was it sparsely attended (compared to the expected turnout of tens of thousands); it was also just sort of sad. The general mood in the crowd seemed less excited about the future of the movement than it did confused, angry, and hateful about what they were fighting. As J. Bryan Lowder at Slate described it: four of the five stages of grief\u2014denial, anger, bargaining, and depression\u2014were on full display today at the March for Marriage\u2026\u201d Attendees screamed at bystanders, and offered up bad science about gay sex\u2014all in all, the event was not exactly welcoming to prospective members of the \u2018traditional marriage\u2019 movement.\n\nMaybe Republican celebrities addressing half-empty ballrooms and a thin crowd of angry protesters scaring off observers is it looks like when you\u2019re losing the battles and you\u2019re losing the war.\n\nSame sex marriage is legal in 19 states and in the District of Columbia. This year, states like Pennsylvania and Oregon have seen judges throw out their bans.\n\nAnd public opinion polls are even worse for \u2018traditional marriage\u2019 supporters. According to Pew Research Polling, in \u201cjust five years, the percentage of adults who say they oppose same-sex marriage has fallen from a majority (54%) to a minority. Today, roughly four-in-ten Americans (39%) say they oppose allowing gay and lesbian couples to wed.\u201d\n\nThis has made some social conservatives rather, um, dyspeptic. A few readers of my report on Thursday\u2019s March for Marriage seemed to think that I was being unfair to attendees. One lovely, presumably God-loving, reader emailed me to say, \u201cI tried to think of the right word to describe you. The \u2018C\u2019 word came to mind. Yes, I believe you to fit the definition of a cunt.\u201d (To which the obvious retort was: the Christ-like thing to do would be to forgive me).\n\nBut the reason why my report made it seem like every person I encountered at the March for Marriage was hateful, uninformed, and just generally very, very, sad, is because that was who attended the event. Organizers of the march say that it is a march for traditional marriage, not against same-sex marriage\u2014and that very well could have been the intention. However, it seems that the only people interested in exerting energy to support such a cause are the very people who will walk up to you and, before asking your name or where you\u2019re from, tell you that anal and oral sex reduce the lifespans of gay men by 25 years. (Yes, that really happened.)\n\nWith well-reasoned arguments like that, perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that social conservatives are struggling.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:43.669+0000"}

Stone insists he resigned, and that Team Trump simply caught wind of his imminent departure, and leaked word he had been terminated.\n\nI\u2019ve known the legendary strategist for years, and have interviewed him numerous times. I caught up with him for a quick phone call on Monday morning. As always, Roger Stone is both quotable and colorful. Enjoy.\n\nGood to talk with you, as always. What the hell happened this weekend?\n\nI wasn\u2019t fired. I quit. And I quit because I felt I was having no impact on the direction of the campaign, which got off to an extraordinarily good start. I think he\u2019s unique, in that he has the stature and the media access and independence to drive a reform message all the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nThey claim you were fired.\n\nThe claim that I was fired was quickly disproved\u2026I left on my own volition, but I continue to strongly support Trump because I think he has a unique opportunity here, and it would really be tragic if he doesn\u2019t realize his full potential.\n\nRight, but somebody on his campaign presumably lied about this. Aren\u2019t you pissed?\n\nThis is the oldest fight in American politics. It\u2019s the advance men and the merchandisers versus those men and women of ideas. I think politics is about sweeping big ideas, and a few memorable phrases to get people to remember them. It\u2019s not about minutiae\u2026and I just think it is tragic that the Trump campaign appears to have gone into this cul-de-sac where we\u2019re bickering with Megyn Kelly\u2014who is not running for president.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Trump said something insulting on this campaign.\n\nIn all fairness, he\u2019s absolutely right about illegal immigration\u2026If any illegal commits any crime\u2026that\u2019s one crime too many. And Trump\u2019s very important point was dramatized by the Steinle murder in San Francisco. The illegal who killed this woman had been thrown out of the country and returned five times. The U.S. Senate would not even be considering doing away with sanctuary cities if Donald Trump hadn\u2019t elevated this issue in the public consciousness.\n\nSo was it the Megyn Kelly comments that caused you to resign?\n\nIn all honesty, I thought Trump won the exchange with Kelly in the debate. He should have just left it there. It was the next day that I think was counterproductive. I was really hoping that he would pivot to his issue agenda.\n\nBut instead, he starts tweeting about Megyn Kelly. So are you saying he\u2019s actually sending his own tweets?\n\nTrump\u2019s style is not going to change. He is unscripted. He is unhandled. He is un-coached. Nobody puts words in his mouth. He does operate his own Twitter feed. I just think he is, to a certain extent, being ill served by yes men\u2014people who say \u201cyes sir\u201d but never raise an alternative view of what ought to be done.\n\n\n\nIt sounds like the villain is his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Is he trying to get rid of Trump loyalists?\n\nYeah, he reminds me a lot of [former Nixon Chief of Staff] Bob Haldeman\u2014and he\u2019ll probably end up the same way.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re having to go back and explain a gaffe, that\u2019s counterproductive.\u201d\n\nWhat about Sam Nunberg, who got fired the other week over some allegedly racist things he posted on Facebook?\n\nHe was the campaign wonk. Very bright guy. He\u2019s got some issues. Yeah, he\u2019s somewhat neurotic\u2014because he believes in ideas. And he believes in Trump. And he wants to see a professional campaign move forward. So, do I think he was set up? Yeah, I do think he was set up. Do I think it\u2019s unfortunate? I think the campaign will miss him.\n\nBack to Megyn Kelly and the \u201cbleeding\u201d comment. Trump claims he wasn\u2019t referring to her period, but\u2014\n\n\n\nYou know what, Gerald Ford said he didn\u2019t mean Poland was free of Russian influence right after he said it. When you\u2019re explaining, you\u2019re losing ground. When you\u2019re having to go back and explain a gaffe, that\u2019s counterproductive.\n\nBut it is a problem to declare war on Fox News, right?\n\nIt\u2019s counterproductive. You have to recognize that Fox is reaching somewhere between seven and eight out of ten of the primary voters that Trump needs to be concerned about. CNN is only reaching about four out of ten. Their audiences are very, very different\u2026I think the voters would rather go to war with Iran and China over trade, rather than go to war with Fox News.\n\nOkay, I want to switch gears. There\u2019s an allegation out there today that Trump is funneling money to Breitbart in return for favorable coverage. Is this true?\n\nIt\u2019s funny because both [Newsmax\u2019s] Chris Ruddy and [The Daily Caller\u2019s] Tucker Carlson called me this morning to ask where their payoffs are.\n\n[Laughs.]\n\nThat is, to my knowledge, totally false. Trump has never paid for any kind of media coverage, online, or otherwise\u2014at least as far as I know. But [Buzzfeed\u2019s] McKay Coppins is really not a credible reporter. He\u2019s the same guy who wrote that Trump would never run, and that Trump would never file his financial disclosures, and that if Trump did run that he would fall flat on his face.\n\nSo McKay Coppins is zero for three. Why anyone would buy his book about the Republican process, given the fact that he\u2019s now zero for four, kind of astounds me.\n\nDamn, you\u2019re good with the quotes. Why don\u2019t we just interview you all the time?\n\nWe do. I\u2019m the men\u2019s fashion correspondent for the Daily Caller. And if I don\u2019t get a fashion piece out soon, Tucker\u2019s going to brain me.\n\nAny comments on Trump\u2019s fashion sense?\n\nThe most exciting thing in the last week was that Trump decided to wear the red \u201cpower tie,\u201d because Trump is the man to define it. The red power tie was on the cover of The Art of The Deal. He\u2019s the guy who made it a thing in the \u201970s. It was almost like a signature thing.\n\nIt sounds like you wanted to preserve Trump\u2019s unique style, but add maybe just a touch of political strategy and organization to the chaos. It reminds me of what Ed Rollins tried, but failed to do, with Ross Perot, but\u2014\n\nI\u2019m not familiar with Ed Rollins ever actually running a successful campaign. And the one he did run in New Jersey for Christie Whitman, he, of course, ended up before the grand jury, trying to explain whether he had gone out and tried to suppress the black vote.\n\nSecond, I\u2019m not really in the school of trashing my clients. I mean, Ed Rollins has trashed \u201cPresident Bachmann,\u201d who he worked for, \u201cPresident Huckabee,\u201d who he worked for, \u201cPresident Perot,\u201d who he worked for. I have no interest in trashing my clients, even when I disagree with them. I am not going to say anything negative about Donald Trump\u2026and I\u2019m not going to be in the Rollins school of denouncing those who have paid me.\n\nSo you\u2019re still a Trump fan?\n\nLook, he\u2019s the greatest salesman who ever lived. And that enthusiasm, that upbeat enthusiasm, kind of reminds me of Reagan. He thinks the country is in deep trouble. But that our best days are still ahead of us, not behind us. And it can be infectious. Those of us who are still Trump loyalists use as our hashtag #yuge. The people who use that are the Trump loyalists.\n\nSo how does this end?\n\nThis is going to be a very long race. I think that because all the primaries up till March 14 are proportional\u2026you could have a very long, drawn out struggle for the nomination. You could have a brokered convention. Therefore, you could have a convention that is settled on the basis of negotiations between the camps. And there is no greater negotiator than Donald Trump.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:43.975+0000"}

This is a matter of principle.\u201d\n\nGoodman made a valiant effort at rattling McConnell on that front by asking him who he voted for in Kentucky\u2019s 2010 Republican primary.\n\nYou might recall that race was between McConnell\u2019s handpicked successor to retiring Sen. Jim Bunning, Trey Grayson, and the man McConnell has called the most credible presidential candidate from Kentucky since Henry Clay, Rand Paul.\n\nThe problem with Grimes\u2019s answer is that she had no problem telling Austin Ryan, who interviewed Grimes as part of a documentary for KET and the University of Kentucky, that she voted for Hillary Clinton in Kentucky\u2019s 2008 Democratic primary.\n\nUltimately, who Grimes voted for in the last two presidential elections isn\u2019t going to be what decides this race. What has hurt Grimes throughout is who won the presidency and how Kentucky views him.\n\nThe president\u2019s approval ratings hover around 30 percent in Kentucky, and McConnell has all but physically sewn Obama to Grimes.\n\nOn the flip side of that coin, the positions McConnell takes that make liberal Democrats shake with rage\u2014on climate change, health care, the minimum wage\u2014were on full display Monday night.\n\nThe senator repeated his statement that he hasn\u2019t said anything in private that he hasn\u2019t said in public.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that McConnell has been consistent throughout the race in opposing raising the minimum wage\u2014one of Grimes\u2019s central campaign arguments\u2014he has also said in interviews and on the Senate floor that he favors a return to an open amendment process.\n\nThe last claim is difficult to reconcile with McConnell\u2019s vow to a Koch brothers retreat, secretly recorded and reported by left-leaning publications, that if he becomes Senate majority leader, the Senate won\u2019t be voting on \u201call these gosh darn proposals.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you were consistently against helping people here in Kentucky getting a living wage?\u201d Grimes asked.\n\nHammering the idea that McConnell is beholden to \u201cmillionaires and billionaires,\u201d Grimes repeatedly aimed to portray McConnell as beholden to wealthy special interests.\n\nIt just seemed Monday night, as it has throughout, that her aim was off.\n\nIn perhaps her best dig of the night, Grimes accused McConnell of making the remarks to his \u201cfamily,\u201d the Koch brothers, after he \u201casked them to help him buy his way back to Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nMcConnell also continued his incredible argument that Kentucky\u2019s successfully implemented health-care exchange, Kynect, is just a website that was funded by a federal grant and that the exchange could still exist even after \u201cObamacare\u201d is repealed \u201croot and branch.\u201d\n\nBut there again, Grimes\u2019s fear of being tied to Obama or Obamacare and her refusal to articulate her own position made it difficult to hit McConnell on his fudged explanation. Instead, she fell back on her stock answer that there are parts of the law that need to be fixed.\n\nIf there were fireworks\u2014think snakes and sprinklers instead of Fourth of July\u2014they came when Grimes assailed McConnell for \u201cbecoming a multimillionaire on the backs of hardworking Kentuckians.\u201d\n\nMcConnell responded: \u201cI can\u2019t let that stand.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe knows that is a result of an inheritance, that my wife\u2019s mother passed away, and she persistently says that,\u201d he said.\n\nGrimes has been criticized by fact-checkers for suggesting in ads that McConnell became wealthy because of his service in the Senate. The truth is that the majority of McConnell\u2019s wealth belongs to his wife, former U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao.\n\nChao\u2019s father, a Taiwanese immigrant who became a shipping magnate, gave the couple a significant financial gift when the two were married, and the bulk of their wealth was the result of an inheritance they received when Chao\u2019s mother died.\n\n\u201cIf I had to pick the worst moment for Grimes, it\u2019s the discussion of McConnell being a multimillionaire,\u201d Voss said. \u201cHe not only shot her argument down cleanly and factually, in a way regular people could easily understand, her tone didn\u2019t cast her in a favorable light.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the 60-minute debate, Grimes interrupted McConnell repeatedly, apparently trying to shift the narrative away from who she voted for and rattle him.\n\nThe day before Grimes\u2019s disastrous showing with the Courier-Journal editorial board last week, McConnell made a misstep of his own, drawing fire and ridicule from the left for a \u201cneedlessly angry\u201d performance on the popular Kentucky sports program Kentucky Sports Radio.\n\nBut the senator never took the bait and subsequently avoided his own Rick Lazio moment, allowing Grimes to finish interrupting him before he patiently duct-taped an Obama mask on her head.\n\nUltimately, there was little damage done to either candidate that hasn\u2019t already been done, and the question that will be answered on Nov. 4 is who Kentuckians dislike more: Obama or McConnell.\n\nIf there\u2019s a bonus question, it\u2019s who Grimes will vote for.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:44.510+0000"}

Things aren\u2019t great there right now.\n\nDowntown Perry, Georgia is the sort of place you could roll a ball through with one pitch. The coffee shop on the corner is called \u201cThe Coffee Shop.\u201d A few doors down, Jack West, the local barber, has been cutting locals\u2019 hair for 64 years. The rest of Perry, with its population of around 15,000, is ringed by churches, pecan groves, and cotton fields.\n\nBut the little town in middle Georgia is now at the center of this year\u2019s increasingly ugly Senate race, pitting one longtime Perry family against another as Democrat Michelle Nunn, the only daughter of Perry\u2019s most famous product, former Senator Sam Nunn, faces off against Republican David Perdue, a Perry native whose cousin, former Georgia governor Sonny Perdue, still lives there, along with a contingent of Perdue cousins, children, and extended family.\n\nThe contest between two of the town\u2019s most respected families has recently transformed from a polite affair into an all-out brawl as more than $15 million of outside money has poured into the state and as razor-thin poll numbers have ratcheted up the pressure on both campaigns. The result has been a storm of leaked documents, oppo dumps, whisper campaigns, of the campaign, particularly Perdue\u2019s attacks on Nunn.\n\nThe most controversial of those attacks has been one stating that Nunn \u201cfunded organizations linked to terrorists\u201d as the CEO of President George H.W. Bush\u2019s Points of Light Foundation. The charge quotes a Nunn campaign document, a kind of self-oppo-research paper that referred to Points of Light\u2019s funding of an Islamic relief group. But the document merely warned of the possibility of such an attack; it did not say the attack would be accurate. Neal Bush, the former president\u2019s son, has called the ad shameful, while Michelle Nunn called it \u201ca terrible lie.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Nunn has run a series of ads featuring women who worked at two of Perdue\u2019s former companies, including one woman wearing an oxygen mask struggling to breathe. Another ad asks, \u201cCan the women of Georgia trust David Perdue?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not the sort of thing you expect from those two families,\u201d said a Perry woman in front of Ashley Marie\u2019s Boutique, who didn\u2019t want to use her name talking about anyone else in town. \u201cI saw the debate and it was horrifying.\u201d\n\nThe debate she spoke of had taken place earlier in the week at the Georgia National State Fair in Perry, down the road from Sam Nunn Boulevard and David Perdue Elementary School. Sandwiched on the fairgrounds between the sheep rodeo and Robinson\u2019s pig races, Nunn and Perdue squared off in front of a crowd so raucous the event seemed more like \u201cThe Jerry Springer Show\u201d than an off-year Senate debate.\n\nPerdue kicked off the debate with a greeting. His \u201cWelcome to Perdue country!\u201d was a reference to both the large Perdue family presence in the area and to the fact that although Michelle Nunn was born in Perry, her family moved to Washington when her father was elected to the Senate in 1972 to represent Georgia. Nunn has lived and worked in Atlanta for more than 25 years since then, but the \u201ccarpetbagger\u201d accusation persists from Republicans.\n\nNunn spent much of her time that night, and throughout the general election, painting Perdue as a greedy, callous corporate boss, and hitting Perdue for his own time outside of Georgia\u2014 decades as a top executive around the globe, including time at firms that either outsourced or ended American operations.\n\nSandwiched on the fairgrounds between the sheep rodeo and Robinson\u2019s pig races, Nunn and Perdue squared off in front of a crowd so raucous the event seemed more like The Jerry Springer Show than an off-year Senate debate.\n\n\u201cDavid\u2026talked about all these countries, Thailand and Singapore and India and Pakistan, but not once did he talk about creating jobs in the United States,\u201d Nunn said in the debate.\n\nPerdue dismissed Nunn\u2019s attacks as \u201cdesperate,\u201d asked if Nunn\u2019s campaign wasn\u2019t \u201ca well-funded attempt to deceive Georgia voters.\u201d He also repeatedly tied her to President Obama, whose approval ratings in the state hover in the 30s. \u201cHe hand-picked her. He funded her,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cDo you really think she\u2019s not going to support him once she\u2019s there?\u201d\n\nOutside of the debate arena, the themes on voters\u2019 minds were the same as those on the debate stage. Kat Smith-Tice and Leslie Davis drove to Perry from Atlanta with David Perdue signs in hand. Both women work with their husbands\u2019 small businesses and pointed to health-care reform as their primary reason for supporting Perdue.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest thing that\u2019s slowed the economy down is Obamacare,\u201d said Smith-Tice.\n\nDavis agreed: \u201cObamacare is a mess. We all know our health-care system wasn\u2019t working but (Congress) needed to sit down and figure it out instead of shoving this piece of crap down our throats.\u201d\n\nTeresa Vance went to the debate from Atlanta to cheer on Nunn. \u201cI think she has the same integrity as her father. She has a mind of her own, she\u2019s not a parrot,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Congress can\u2019t start compromising, we can\u2019t have change.\u201d\n\nVance said she found the rowdy Perry debate \u201cthrilling,\u201d but the bare-knuckled brawl wasn\u2019t as welcome in Perdue and Nunn\u2019s shared hometown.\n\n\u201cIf you say a bad word about someone here, it gets around fast,\u201d said Jack West, the barber. West said local support for Nunn and Perdue seems \u201cabout neck and neck\u201d to him based on yard signs and customers\u2019 comments he\u2019s observed. He praised both the Nunn and Perdue families, but declined with a smile to say who he\u2019s voting for. \u201cThat\u2019s not good for business.\u201d\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:45.313+0000"}
{"entityId": 1693, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Republican front-runner falls into a trap devised long ago by the Moral Majority, not the media.\n\nWell, we\u2019re getting a pretty quick narrative rethink on Scott Walker, aren\u2019t we? Two weeks ago he was a conquering hero. Now he\u2019s a nincompoop. The truth is undoubtedly somewhere in between\u2014although exactly which of the two poles he ends up nearer is one of the coming campaign\u2019s mysteries.\n\nBut whether you\u2019re liberal or conservative\u2014that is, whether you think his cutesy refusal to confirm Barack Obama\u2019s religiosity to The Washington Post was an outrage or act of truth-telling\u2014the bottom line here is what my colleague Matt Lewis said it is: The way Walker and his people handled it was plain old not-ready-for-prime-time-ism. A first-time presidential candidate doesn\u2019t get many mulligans on that front before the media decide he\u2019s a second-rater and start covering him that way.\n\nThe most interesting thing about this hubbub, though, is the nature of the defense of Walker, which reveals a breathtaking lack of self-awareness on the right, or maybe dishonesty, or maybe both.\n\nThe main defense has been: Why was this question relevant? Why does Scott Walker even have to be asked about whether the president is a Christian? Well, maybe because for the last 30 or 35 years, the political right has dragged the question of a candidate\u2019s piety from the fringes of the political debate, where it belonged and belongs, to the white-hot center, where it is a malignant tumor on our politics.\n\nSo it\u2019s supposed to be unfair for Walker to have to answer a simple question like the one he was asked? Ridiculous.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way. Of course we\u2019ve had moralizers from the beginning. Thomas Jefferson\u2019s political foes called him an \u201cinfidel\u201d and a \u201chowling atheist\u201d and warned that if he won the presidency, churches would be converted into whorehouses. But then America matured, a little, and became a world power, and began taking in large numbers of immigrants, and started thinking about the world not only in terms of spirituality but in terms of psychology, social science, and so on. By the time all those forces had coalesced\u2014the 1930s, let\u2019s call it; the thermidorean backwash of the Scopes Trial\u2014we by and large stopped having religious litmus tests for the presidency.\n\nAh but 1960, you\u2019re thinking; well, yes, but that was totally different. No one questioned John Kennedy\u2019s lack of religious faith. Indeed the issue was the opposite\u2014that his Catholic faith was so all-defining that he\u2019d govern as a Vatican fifth-columnist. For many years after that, a candidate\u2019s religious beliefs were part of the story, certainly, but what reigned was a quality of tolerant and easy-going religious neutrality that was a reflection of the regnant, and largely bipartisan, Protestantism of the day. Candidates didn\u2019t run around dog-whistling to the pious and implying that the impious were somehow lesser Americans whose votes ought to count for less.\n\nOddly it was a Democrat who first wore his religious on his sleeve in the presidential arena. Still, Jimmy Carter, though an evangelical, was still enough of a liberal to not tie his religious beliefs to a particular ideological agenda.\n\nThis all changed\u2014and give the man his due\u2014with Jerry Falwell and the Moral Majority, and the growing evangelization of the Republican primary electorate. Professions of faith from GOP candidates became more and more grandiose, like George W. Bush\u2019s claim that Jesus Christ was his favorite philosopher. I\u2019ve never known whether it was planned that he would say that or whether he just said it off the cuff, but whatever the case it was kind of brilliant of him, it must be admitted. When liberals made fun of him for not saying Locke or whatever, they managed to sound like snooty eggheads and Jesus-haters both at once.\n\nAt the same time that the religious right pushed Jesus into the presidential boxing ring, it did all it could to throw traditional religious neutrality out of it, such that positions that had been completely uncontroversial 20 years before grew to be toxic for Democrats. I think here of Al Gore being afraid to say in 2000 that he believed in evolution, one of the nadirs of recent presidential history.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s Republicans and conservatives who have made religious belief central to the conversation of presidential politics. And not just religious belief\u2014a particular kind of (conservative) religious belief. Republicans made this a topic.\n\nNow in fairness, Obama\u2019s faith was a question in 2008, because of Jeremiah Wright, and that pot got a stirring not only from Republicans but from Hillary Clinton too. But the guy has now been the president for a long time, and voters twice elected him by reasonably comfortable margins. So these kinds of questions about Obama are still raised only in the fever swamps where Walker is trying to launch his dinghy. It\u2019s only over there that these things matter.\n\nSo the question the Post put to Walker was completely logical and defensible within that tradition for which conservatism was responsible and to which Walker has recently been pandering, by weaseling around recently on the topic of evolution.\n\nSo it\u2019s supposed to be unfair for Walker to have to answer a simple question like the one he was asked? Ridiculous. Liberals didn\u2019t make faith a litmus test. If Walker and the others want to parade their own Christian credentials, any question along those lines is fair game. Besides, as Lewis said, there\u2019s an easy answer: I don\u2019t doubt that he is, it\u2019s just his ideas and policies that are wrong. But of course that\u2019s not enough for their base. If Walker got caught in any trap over the weekend, it\u2019s one of conservatism\u2019s devising, not the media\u2019s.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:45.831+0000"}
{"entityId": 1694, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "It makes a whole lot of sense for Republicans to embrace the minimum wage, and many GOP leaders already have. But will Mitch McConnell stop them?\n\nFor a party that just won a wave election, Republican prospects are dour. Their long-term weaknesses remain significant. Even now, the GOP still polls less well than the Democratic Party with a surly electorate. Conservative thinkers and strategists recognize that \u201cThe Republican brand is [still] tarnished,\u201d and further warn that \u201cRepublicans must show they can truly govern \u2026 or lose again very shortly.\u201d\n\nAs George W. Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson explained, \u201cRepublicans are often perceived as indifferent to working-class struggles\u2014because they sometimes are. The GOP appeal seems designed for a vanishing electorate.\u201d Indeed, Gerson fears that the midterm victory may only accelerate \u201ctrends that are gradually condemning the Republican Party to regional appeal and national irrelevance.\u201d\n\nThe irony of this dilemma is that the GOP has a ready-made policy agenda that can resurrect their brand with working-class voters while also advancing conservative ideals. This conservative dream policy? Fix the minimum wage.\n\nHistorically, conservatives treated the minimum wage as an affront to free labor and a step on a slippery slope towards statism. This aversion is hogwash, an ideological relic analogous to the Left\u2019s historic fondness for public sector unions. A minimum wage is consistent with conservative ideals, for four reasons.\n\nFirst, as conservative businessman Ron Unz has explained, a higher minimum wage would reduce welfare spending. This welfare spending discourages work, increases taxes, and operates as a hidden and inefficient subsidy to low-wage businesses. Unz also notes that a higher minimum wage would discourage illegal immigration and boost consumer spending. A predictable, inflation-adjusted minimum wage would make business planning easier.\n\nSecond, available evidence supports these arguments and disproves conservative fears. Switzerland has a higher minimum wage than the United States, at roughly $15 per hour, but also has a more competitive economy. Swiss leaders also dispel the \u201cslippery slope\u201d idea by repeatedly rejecting substantial minimum wage increases. Additionally, many top economists suspect that a higher minimum wage in the United States might boost the economy, not reduce employment. Overall, the weight of the empirical evidence supports these essentially conservative arguments for the minimum wage.\n\nA minimum wage is consistent with conservative ideals, for four reasons.\n\nThird and perhaps most importantly, a minimum wage creates intergenerational opportunity that is vital for the conservative worldview. Today, economic mobility between generations is lower in the United States than in many countries in Europe. Evidence demonstrates that children raised in extreme poverty have radically less lifetime opportunity than middle class Americans. A higher minimum wage would help encourage a culture of work and a level playing field for the rising generation.\n\nFinally, the political realities of this issue are overwhelming. In the near term, a hike is popular. A USA Today/Pew Research poll last year reported 71 percent support, including 50 percent support among Republicans, and on Tuesday voters turned out to support minimum wage hikes in red states like Arkansas and South Dakota. Even employers tend to agree: a recent survey of employers reported by the Huffington Post showed that 60 pecent of employers thought a higher minimum wage would help grow the economy.\n\nIn the long-term, as Unz has noted, a minimum wage turns more voters into taxpayers, altering Mitt Romney\u2019s infamous \u201ctaker\u2019s math\u201d in favor of the GOP. More dramatically, as billionaire Nick Hanauer has pointed out, in the absence of a minimum wage, it\u2019s impossible to rule out a radical redistributive upheaval along the lines of what has destroyed prosperity in Latin America and Africa.\n\nThe leadership of the GOP seems not to realize the massive opportunity in front of them. Newly empowered Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a previous private meeting with wealthy donors, said he would stop a minimum wage from even coming to a vote. Conservative columnist Reihan Salam suggested that GOP-backed minimum wage discussions might be feints for appearances only.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results, however, added momentum to the Republican living wage caucus, despite McConnell\u2019s victory. The Republican\u2019s national platform emphasized populist economic themes. Charlie Baker in Massachusetts and Charles Rauner in Illinois scored upset gubernatorial wins with pro-minimum messages. Other like-minded Republican winners this week include Rick Snyder, Asa Hutchinson, and Shelley Moore Capito, expanding a caucus that already included established conservative leaders such as Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney, and Bill O\u2019Reilly. Even Republicans who opposed a federal wage hike in this cycle were often supportive or silent about state and local increases.\n\nIf the GOP uses the minimum wage in this way, they will ironically be stealing a page from Bill Clinton\u2019s playbook. Twenty-five years ago, Democrats faced the same challenges in reverse. They had used the advantages of incumbency to hold the House for decades, but performed poorly in six Presidential contests (only winning narrowly in 1976 in the wake of the Watergate scandal). As political journalist Molly Ball recently wrote, Democrats lost elections during this period because they were seen as a \u201csoft on crime\u201d party of \u201cwelfare rights.\u201d\n\nThen along came Bill Clinton and other centrists, who changed the party\u2019s stance on crime and welfare. This ushered in a 16-year period in which Democrats had a net positive public favorability rating of plus 15 percent (vs. today\u2019s GOP net favorability of minus 25 percent). As Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus lamented, since Clinton, the GOP has \u201cnot really won a decisive presidential election.\u201d\n\nEven as a Democrat, I am rooting for the GOP to seize this slam-dunk opportunity. Both the country and the Democratic Party are better served when a responsible Republican Party offers conservative solutions to common problems. Republicans can change their brand, appeal to the electorate, shrink government, grow the economy, and save capitalism. Along the way, they will also give moderate American voters a real choice, rather than ceding a monopoly over national political discourse to the Democratic Party.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:46.085+0000"}

They knew it was coming and they allowed it to happen.\u201d\n\nSmith attributes the administration\u2019s alleged inaction to the president having a mental illness.\n\nIn a statement published on his campaign website last week, Smith alleged that there are \u201csignificant indications that President Obama has purposefully placed children into harm's way for his own benefit. People who intentionally hurt children for attention can be accused of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. The facts surrounding the surge of unaccompanied, non-citizen children across the border support this charge.\u201d\n\nWhen Smith was asked how he could diagnose Obama, he admitted he is not a psychologist and was just speculating.\n\nMunchausen Syndrome by proxy is a mental illness that is also a form of child abuse, according to the National Institutes of Health. Parents or caretakers display signs of the illness when they make up symptoms or cause symptoms for their children to appear as if they were sick.\n\nSmith alleges that the announcement of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a memorandum drafted by the Obama administration in June 2012, led to a spike in the number of immigrant children referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. And the symptoms of Obama\u2019s illness became clear to Smith in January of 2014 when the Federal Business Office posted a listing seeking \u201cescort services for unaccompanied alien children.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny adult who clearly sees danger for a child would step in to prevent it,\u201d Smith says on his website. \u201cPresident Obama, when requesting transport services for 65,000 unaccompanied children earlier this year, saw the coming harm and did nothing to stop it.\u201d\n\nSmith is running against incumbent Democrat Filemon Vela, who destroyed his opponent in 2012 with 62 percent of the vote. The army vet entered politics this year initially planning to run as an independent but switched to the GOP to gain more traction.\n\nSmith legitimized his call for legal recourse by suggesting there was intentionality in this blatant lack of attention to an impending crisis. It was to demonstrate to Republicans just how bad the immigration issue is, imploring them to agree with proposed Democratic reforms after seeing children suffer.\n\n\u201cThis situation was promoted, supported by the Obama administration and it was being taken advantage of,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey saw an opportunity to use it as a political weapon against the Republican Party and sure enough, they\u2019re doing it. This is an opportunity for the Democrats to force the Republican Party into a national immigration reform debate.\u201d\n\nWhile this causal relationship is not quite a popular opinion among Republicans, the administration is drawing ire nonetheless for the ensuing crisis. But Smith is by no means afraid to make unpopular declarations. In an interview with the Caller Times, he said that Islam is \u201coppressive to women and children,\u201d and that he really \u201cdislike[s] who these people are.\u201d\n\nSmith says that his opinions about people of the Muslim faith were formulated during his time serving in Iraq. He wrote a book entitled Message to Garcia, (the name is based on a fictional Cuban general created by 19th century American author Elbert Hubbard), in which he opines on the Islamic faith in a chapter called: \u201cThis is your brain on Arab.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Middle East, Islam is militant,\u201d Smith writes. \u201cIt is a religion of manipulation. It has no standards. There is no equivalent to the Ten Commandments in the Koran. Where the Bible would tell you \u2018though shall not covet\u2019, the Koran will give you all the circumstances under which you would be allowed to covet.\u201d\n\nWith these misguided principles, it is easy for Muslims to make it to heaven, according to Smith.\n\n\u201cA Christian believes that acknowledgement of one\u2019s sins and asking forgiveness for them, and accepting Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior is the path that leads to Paradise,\u201d the chapter reads. \u201cNot so with Islam. There are many ways to enter Allah\u2019s Kingdom. Killing an infidel is the easiest. Their death at your hand guarantees you access. Related to this is to die in combat within Allah\u2019s will. You can strap a vest of explosives around you, walk into a crowded day-care and as long as you attempt to kill the American soldier standing outside by the window, then you and all those kids are on their way to Paradise.

As he parsed his words, it appeared he was trying to keep one foot in the climate change camp and the other in the deniers\u2019 camp, a political jujitsu that will be viewed as positioning for the Republican primaries, while not fully closing the door to a more centrist position should he win the nomination.\n\nRubio will be 43 later this month, and when he was asked in an interview that aired Sunday on This Week whether he had the experience to be president, he replied, \u201cI do,\u201d though he conceded multiple others could make the same claim. He pointed out that he has been in public service since 2000, serving in the Florida House as majority whip, majority leader, and speaker of the House before he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010. Asked Tuesday if his reelection in 2016 would compromise a potential run for president, he said that if someone decides to run for president, they shouldn\u2019t do it \u201cwith some exit strategy in mind,\u201d adding that he\u2019s \u201cnot looking for some eject button.\u201d\n\nThe follow-up question had to do with Jeb Bush and whether Rubio would defer his presidential ambitions should Bush enter the race. A fellow Floridian, Bush, 61, has been a friend and mentor to Rubio, and the expectation is that the younger man would stand down for Bush. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard he was interested,\u201d Rubio quipped, flashing a smile, then turning serious. \u201cHe\u2019s going through his own decision-making process. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the kind of decision you make with someone else\u2019s decision in mind.\u201d He added that if Bush were asked the same question, he would likely give the same answer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the prediction business.\u201d\n\nBush reportedly is pondering the impact that a presidential run would have on his wife, who has never been comfortable in the political spotlight, and their adult daughter, who battled drug addiction a decade ago. Whether he will run is an open question, and for many in the GOP, Rubio is the next best thing in terms of comfort level with the growing Hispanic population and willingness to tackle immigration reform.\n\nAsked if he thought the House would pass a bill this year, Rubio said, \u201cI\u2019m not in the prediction business,\u201d but he pointed out that when the Senate passed legislation a year ago, \u201cnot a single member of the United States Senate filed an amendment calling for the rounding up and deportation of the 12 million [here illegally]. We\u2019re not going to do that,\u201d he said. Rubio\u2019s support for the Senate bill cost him among the GOP\u2019s Tea Party wing, and he has backed away from his leadership role on the issue, taking stands more popular with the right, such as calling the war on poverty a failure and giving Hillary Clinton a failing grade on her tenure as secretary of state.\n\nRubio wants credit for taking courageous stands, even if he doesn\u2019t stick with them. He called the broken immigration system \u201cthe single biggest impediment we\u2019re facing right now.\u201d He said he \u201cgets it\u201d that not taking on immigration when he did last year would have been \u201csmarter\u201d for him but that he didn\u2019t come to Washington \u201cjust to score points.\u201d It was a theme he returned to, saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t come here just to sign a bunch of letters and give speeches.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s personal story is powerful, and he frames everything in the context of his parents\u2019 struggle to achieve in their adopted country. He heaped praise on Social Security and Medicare for giving his father a secure retirement and a dignified death, and he said he would never do anything to hurt his 83-year-old mother and others like her. His generation needs to face up to the fact that these programs can\u2019t continue without reform, he said. \u201cThis is not a scare tactic,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s simple math.\u201d Preparing for retirement is \u201cthe why of politics, not merely optional dirty work.\u201d It\u2019s also iffy politics for a Florida senator who thinks he might run for president.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:46.586+0000"}

Against the backdrop of Arizona\u2019s defunct \u201cTurn the Gays Away\u201d law and others like it, the Court will decide whether corporations have religious beliefs, and whether those beliefs can affect the rights of other people.\n\nThe case\u2014actually the consolidated cases of Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius and Conestoga Wood v. Sebelius\u2014is also another referendum on Obamacare. At issue in the case is the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that employer-provided insurance plans include coverage for contraception. The owners of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood, both privately held companies, argue this mandate violates the First Amendment\u2019s protection of the free exercise of religion.\n\nIf the Court goes Hobby Lobby\u2019s way\u2014and since the case also affords another bite at the Obamacare apple, it may do so\u2014it will significantly expand the reach of the first amendment. And not in a good way.\n\nFirst, the Court will have to decide that corporations are not only people, but people with consciences. Conservative \u201creligious freedom\u201d activists like to blur the lines between individuals and businesses. They talk about bakers and photographers, but Hobby Lobby is a corporation with $3 billion in revenues, 22,000 employees, and 550 stores around the country. Its owners, the conservative billionaire David Green and his family, argue that what happens to Hobby Lobby happens to them personally.\n\nBut this contention runs counter to the foundation of corporate law itself, which is that companies are legal entities distinct from their owners. If someone trips and falls in a Hobby Lobby store, the Green family isn\u2019t liable (unless they acted negligently as directors). So why are they liable\u2014legally or morally\u2014for the company\u2019s insurance plan?\n\nSecond, the view that corporations have consciences is incoherent. Corporate personhood is a legal fiction, not an ontological or soteriological fact. Conceivably, corporations can be said to have interests that give rise to freedom of expression\u2014that was the holding of Citizens United. But corporations don\u2019t sin, don\u2019t go to hell, and don\u2019t get saved by Jesus.\n\nThird\u2014and this is where most attention has focused\u2014if corporations can opt-out of a general law regarding contraception, why not other laws? This is where Hobby Lobby connects to Arizona\u2019s law. The whole purpose of \u201cTurn the Gays Away\u201d was to carve out religious exemptions to civil rights laws. Normally, a restaurant can\u2019t refuse to serve a customer because she\u2019s black, female, Jewish, or gay (or, obviously, white, male, Muslim, or straight). But if Hobby Lobby can assert a religious objection to contraception coverage, surely a restaurant can assert a religious objection to non-discrimination law.\n\nCorporations don\u2019t sin, don\u2019t go to hell, and don\u2019t get saved by Jesus.\n\n\n\nIn other words, a ruling for Hobby Lobby could make \u201cTurn the Gays Away\u201d the law of the land. As long as a company\u2019s owners can provide a religious reason, they can opt-out of Obamacare, anti-discrimination laws, marriage laws, employment laws\u2014you name it. Forget penis-shaped wedding cakes (yes, the Right is actually worried about this). We\u2019re talking about Fortune 500 companies treating legal marriages unequally, hospitals denying gay spouses their rights, and, yes, denying healthcare to millions of women.\n\nNow, it may strike readers as odd that, in 2014, we are debating the merits of contraception in the first place. Indeed, with nearly 90% of Americans believing birth control to be morally acceptable, most of us no longer are, which is why Hobby Lobby\u2019s lawyers have focused on the \u201cmorning after\u201d pill rather than birth control in general. Yet as Emily Bazelon revealed in Slate, a coterie of right-wing organizations has indeed lined up to oppose contraception itself.\n\nWhich gets to the heart of the matter: This case is really about the sexual revolution and the culture war. Hobby Lobby\u2019s fundamentalist owners don\u2019t like contraception, don\u2019t like non-procreative sex, definitely don\u2019t like extra-marital sex, and, I\u2019m sure, don\u2019t like homosexuality either. The Green family\u2014net worth, $4.9 billion\u2014is said to have donated over $500 million to Christian schools and universities, which in turn have produced the weird, parallel-universe lawyers who are now pursuing this case.\n\nThat, of course, is their right. But in trying to convince the rest of us that conservative Christian morality should be the foundation of our laws, they have lost at the polls, lost at the Supreme Court, and lost in the court of public opinion. Having done so, they are trying to redefine what is meant by \u201creligious liberty\u201d from a shield against government intrusion to a sword against the rights of others.\n\nThese same arguments were used in the 1960s and \u201870s, when the Right had lost the legal, constitutional, and moral battles against civil rights. Racist restaurateurs and racist universities said their religion compelled them to turn away African-Americans, notwithstanding what the Civil Rights Act had to say. They took their cause all the way to the Supreme Court, where they finally lost, in 1983 (Bob Jones University vs. United States).\n\nIn a concurring opinion in the Right\u2019s favorite religious freedom case\u2014that of a photographer found to have violated New Mexico\u2019s antidiscrimination laws by refusing to photograph a same-sex couple\u2014a Republican-appointed judge wrote that he sympathized with the photographers\u2019 grave religious objections. But, he said, the price of participating in the open market is to play by the same rules as everyone else.\n\nThat is why corporations\u2014large ones like Hobby Lobby and small ones like a photography shop\u2014are people. Not because they have souls or sins, but because they are legally distinct from us as individuals, and bound by laws of general application. Denying contraceptive coverage while providing other insurance was found, in 2000, to be a violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. In other words, it discriminates against women. It is undemocratic. That, not the gospel, is the law of the land.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:48.186+0000"}

Not a good combination.\n\n\u201cBut part of this job is also the theater of it. A part of it is, you know, how are you, how, how are you, well, it's not something that\u2014that always comes naturally to me.\u201d \u2014President Barack Obama on Meet The Press, Sunday\n\nSome presidents might have garnered a bit of sympathy and understanding with claims that the \u201ctheater\u201d of the office doesn\u2019t come naturally to them. Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon Johnson, maybe even Richard Nixon, who was so much the anti-natural he hired PR professionals to run his White House. But Barack Obama?\n\nThis is the Obama who as a candidate spoke before 200,000 at Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg Gate? Der Spiegel headlined that speech with: \u201cPeople of the World, Look at Me.\u201d The same candidate who gave his acceptance speech outdoors in Denver surrounded by columns, mocked for their resemblance to ancient Greek temples, which is, ironically enough, where the Greeks performed the new art form of dramatic theater they were creating.\n\nWhy is this pretense necessary? Obama wrote two autobiographies by the age of 40 and is well aware of the role that his mastery of political theater has played in his rapid ascension to the White House. As Valerie Jarrett said of Senate candidate Obama\u2019s speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention: \u201cIt changed his life.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cI\u2019m not good at theater\u201d is a calculated, if awkward, attempt to dismiss criticism as superficial and worthy of, well, theater critics, not serious thinkers. It\u2019s fundamentally condescending, but like a lot of ill-considered defenses, it only reinforces the heart of the criticism. The charge is being disconnected and out of touch, and to dismiss it with a retort that even supporters will find inadequate seems\u2026.disconnected and out of touch.\n\nDemocratic supporters of the president are worried about both the perception and reality of the president\u2019s leadership. \u201cToo passive,\u201d says Senator Diane Feinstein. In the Meet The Press interview he again disputed that he was talking specifically about ISIS when he now famously said in a January 2014 New Yorker interview, \u201cI think the analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn\u2019t make them Kobe Bryant.\u201d As Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler points out, that denial simply isn\u2019t credible as \u201cthe context of Remnick\u2019s question makes it clear that he was asking about ISIS.\u201d\n\nIt is rarely a good thing when the country seems more worried than the president. Or when the country is worried about the president\u2019s level of concern. But when confronted with vexing issues that defy easy solutions, more and more, the president seems to check out rather than dig in.\n\nThe \u201cpassive\u201d comments of Senator Feinstein reflect not just a specific response to ISIS but a larger worldview. Increasingly the president seems to view the world as this dangerous place where things just keep happening but where the United States and our allies have little impact.\n\nWhen we go away, the world has a way of demanding our attention. The task for a president\u2014never easy\u2014is to shape events to America\u2019s advantage rather than allowing events to shape us.\n\nIn one of the more revealing moments in the MTP interview, the president summed up the situation with ISIS and Syria: \u201cYou know, the reason we're in this situation is because Assad brutalized his people and specifically brutalized the Sunni population that is the majority in Syria.\u201d\n\nWell, no. First there\u2019s the fact that previously, the president had assured the world that Bashar al-Assad would soon no longer be in power. In his 2012 State of the Union address, he declared: \u201dA year ago, Qaddafi was one of the world\u2019s longest-serving dictators\u2014a murderer with American blood on his hands. Today, he is gone. And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that human dignity cannot be denied.\u201d\n\nQaddafi would likely not have fallen without external forces aided by the United States (the example cited as a success of \u201cleading from behind\u201d), and Assad\u2019s ability to remain in power has largely been contingent on the United States and others not taking a more active role. If the president believes ISIS has been spawned by Assad brutalizing his people, that would surely be one more reason we should have intervened earlier. Maybe staying out of Syria was the right decision, maybe it was the wrong decision, but let\u2019s don\u2019t pretend that it wasn\u2019t a decision\u2014a decision made by our commander in chief.\n\nBut does ISIS exist as a consequence of Assad\u2019s failures, or is it the latest continuation of a militant Islamic fundamentalism? As Shiraz Maher of the International Centre for the study of Radicalisation wrote in The New Statesman, \u201cThis is precisely what Bin Laden always envisioned. His main thesis on the failure of the Islamist project was that western interference in the Middle East prevented the rise of Islamic governments. Weaken the west\u2019s sphere of influence, he argued, and a caliphate would emerge.\u201d\n\nThis is the antithesis of President Obama\u2019s view. As outlined in his June 2009 Cairo speech, the president clearly believes that Western influence in the Muslim world is a contributing factor to radicalism, not a mitigating force. \u201cTension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims,\u201d the president declared in Cairo, \u201cand a Cold War in which Muslim-majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s certainly true in a historical sense, but the president seems unwilling to acknowledge other realities as well: that withdrawal of Western influence is rarely followed by the triumph of \u201cthe common principles\u2014principles of justice and progress; tolerance and the dignity of all human beings\u201d\u2014that he described in Cairo. It\u2019s as if he assumes that the life experience he describes\u2014\u201cI have known Islam on three continents\u201d\u2014will lead others to a like conclusion.\n\nOur American tendency to see the world as populated by like-minded souls is never productive. It surely was a contributing factor in some of our greatest foreign policy miscalculations, from Vietnam to Iraq.\n\nAmericans are tired of war and would like much of the world to simply go away. But when we go away, the world has a way of demanding our attention. The task for a president\u2014never easy\u2014is to shape events to America\u2019s advantage rather than allowing events to shape us. ISIS\u2014like Vladimir Putin\u2014seems to know what it wants and how to get it. The question is, do we?\n\nWhen the president says we don\u2019t have a strategy to fight ISIS, it\u2019s not theater but reality. When Russia invades another country and our response is predicated on denying it\u2019s an invasion, that\u2019s reality, not theater.\n\nPresident Obama has 864 days left in office, just a couple hundred less than JFK served. The president came to office with great energy and ambition. Chuck Todd asked him if he was \u201cexhausted.\u201d It\u2019s time to prove he\u2019s not.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:48.442+0000"}

But with Election Day less than a week away, Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brian Kemp, is insisting that every voter-registration application submitted by Georgians before the registration deadline has been processed. The missing potential voters? He says there aren\u2019t any.\n\nOn Tuesday, a county judge sided with Kemp and rejected a request by the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights, the NAACP, and the New Georgia Project to intervene in the dispute, on which the two sides disagree on nearly every detail, including whether there is a problem at all.\n\n\u201cThis decision guarantees that there are going to be significant numbers of people who will be disenfranchised and not be put onto the voter-registration rolls even though they are eligible to vote,\u201d said Julie Houk, senior counsel for the Voting Rights Project of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights, after the judge\u2019s ruling, which the groups will likely appeal. \u201cWhat good is early voting if people\u2019s names aren\u2019t on the rolls to vote?\u201d\n\nAt stake are the Georgia governor\u2019s mansion and an open U.S. Senate seat, two neck-and-neck brawls in which Democrats have defied national expectations by keeping the races within striking distance. But Democrats in the still-red state can only win if a coalition of new residents, young voters, and minorities turns out for them, exactly the ones advocates say remain at large more than 10 days into early voting.\n\nAnd at the center of the fight are two young, sometimes brash, diametrically opposed state politicians\u2014Stacey Abrams, the African-American Georgia House minority leader who is seen by Democrats as a fast-rising star, and Kemp, the aggressive young secretary of state who is on most short lists as a future GOP governor contender.\n\nKemp and Abrams clashed earlier this year when Kemp made highly publicized voter-fraud allegations against the New Georgia Project, a nonprofit Abrams founded to register as many of the 800,000 unregistered black and other minorities in the state as possible. The investigation is ongoing, but Kemp has yet to make public any evidence of widespread fraud by the group. Allies of Abrams call the fraud investigation a witch hunt and say the case of the missing registrations is just the second act of the play against her.\n\n\u201cIf Brian Kemp thought he could intimidate the New Georgia Project and get away with it, he will have a rude awakening because an attack on the New Georgia Project is an attack on the ability of organizations to register and engage citizens, and that\u2019s an attack on all of us,\u201d said Francys Johnson, president of the Georgia NAACP. \u201cWe will mortgage every asset we have to defend the right to the ballot. It is sacred in Georgia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are very real problems. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a coordinated attempt to suppress the black vote, but there\u2019s no sense of urgency in Kemp\u2019s office to fix this.\u201d\n\nAdvocates estimate that parallel efforts by the New Georgia Project, the NAACP, and other civil-rights groups should have put between 130,000 and 150,000 new, mostly minority voters on the state\u2019s active-voter rolls. But according to a side-by-side comparison conducted by the New Georgia Project of the secretary of state\u2019s latest active and pending voter lists, up to 50,000 of the applicants do not show up on either.\n\n\u201cStill today, it\u2019s unclear what happened to tens of thousands of those applications,\u201d said an official with NGP.\n\nPeople familiar with Georgia\u2019s paper ballot registration process say that even when it is run with the best of intentions, the system is riddled with inefficiencies, human error, poorly trained workers, and imprecise rules about when Kemp\u2019s office is required to finalize the voter lists. \u201cIt\u2019s just a big, broken system,\u201d said one Democrat. \u201cThese are very real problems. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a coordinated attempt to suppress the black vote, but there\u2019s no sense of urgency in Kemp\u2019s office to fix this.\u201d\n\nNot only is there no urgency to fix the system, but Kemp is insistent that the system doesn\u2019t need fixing. He has touted a new online tool for voters to check their personalized voting information and stands behind his aggressive efforts to combat voter fraud, even where Democrats say essentially none exists.\n\nKemp got the news of the court\u2019s decision as he was campaigning for Gov. Nathan Deal and the rest of the Republican ticket, which he\u2019s a part of, too, as he\u2019s up for reelection in 2014. \u201cWe hope this group will put an end to this,\u201d he told Republican supporters in Columbus. \u201cOur hardworking election workers don\u2019t need to be wasting their time with this ridiculous lawsuit.\u201d\n\nDoug Chalmers, managing member of the Political Law Group in Georgia and an election-law expert who worked with John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign, agrees with Kemp that the judge\u2019s decision to stay out of the fight was the right one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually a good idea for judges to look very closely at the merits of lawsuits filed shortly before an election because sometimes they can be used purely as political tools to fire up political supporters,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cThat seems to be what has happened here.\u201d\n\nIf 50,000 potential votes seem like a small prize in a state of nearly 10 million, consider that outgoing Sen. Saxby Chambliss was forced into a runoff in 2008 when he finished with 49.8 percent of the vote, about 8,000 votes short of the 50 percent mark required for an outright win under Georgia law.\n\nChambliss went on to a huge victory in a runoff against Democrat Jim Martin, but both Michelle Nunn\u2019s and Jason Carter\u2019s campaigns have been clear about their hopes to win outright on Election Day. For Nunn in particular, a January runoff would come a full month after all of Georgia\u2019s state and local runoff elections in early December, a prospect that Democrats worry would favor the GOP\u2019s massive existing infrastructure built up over its last decade of near total political domination of the state.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are high now, the races are tight,\u201d said the NAACP\u2019s Francys Johnson. \u201cIn a close election like this, you don\u2019t have any permanent friends or permanent enemies.

These days, they only care about making a fuss.\n\nYes, it was a pleasant surprise that McConnell\u2019s \u201cclean\u201d DHS bill, which funds the agency and puts the immigration fight off to another day, passed the Senate 98-2 (only James Inhofe and Jeff Sessions voted against it).\n\nBut there is still the House to reckon with. There, the conservatives vow that a clean bill will never pass. Insisting that they\u2019ll oppose Obama on immigration with their last breath, Republicans go on conservative media outlets and blast as \u201cexecutive amnesty\u201d the baby steps that Obama has taken to temporarily delay the deportation of, for instance, undocumented parents with U.S.-born children, despite the inconvenient facts that amnesties are permanent and don\u2019t come from the executive branch.\n\nThey reflexively portray Obama as soft on immigration enforcement, when the chief executive has deported a record number of illegal immigrants\u2014more than 2 million in six years. They love to criticize what Democrats try to do to fix a broken immigration system that often makes it too hard to come legally and too easy to come illegally, while becoming evermore comfortable with doing nothing. And, finally, they beat their chests and talk tough about deporting illegal immigrants, but they rarely say a word about attacking the problem at its roots by fining the employers who give them jobs.\n\nAt this point, for many lawmakers on both the right and the left, the immigration debate is all about theater. What\u2019s actually happening is not as important as the illusion that politicians are able to create. In a debate with so many thorns, the trick is do nothing but look busy, as if you\u2019re actually doing something\u2014even if that \u201csomething\u201d is simply blocking what the other side is trying to do. Nothing gets dealt with, nothing gets solved. But at least no one gets hurt politically, the way they might if the debate were fully engaged. In an honest airing of these issues, both parties would splinter. In each, there are opposing factions\u2014some that want more immigration, others that want less. Neither party wants this reality to be exposed.\n\nRepublican lawmakers are terrified of being accused of caving in. So, they have no choice but to press ahead.\n\nDemocrats waste a lot of time and energy trying to convince voters on the left that they\u2019re compassionate and fair, and that they really want to pass some sort of comprehensive immigration reform that would give the undocumented legal status and perhaps even a path to citizenship.\n\nYeah, sure. That\u2019s why, back in 2009 to 2011, when Democrats controlled both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue\u2014the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives\u2014the party leadership put immigration reform so far on the back burner that the issue completely fell off the stove. Nothing got done. The issue wasn\u2019t even discussed.\n\nIn much the same way, Republicans waste a lot of time and energy trying to convincing conservative voters that Republicans will hold the line against illegal immigration, and that the GOP is the only party that can be trusted to protect the borders and secure the homeland.\n\nThis is precisely the narrative that is now being threatened by the fact that Republicans are willing to gamble with the concept of homeland security. If conservatives cared as much about keeping Americans safe as they do scoring political points off the immigration issue, they wouldn\u2019t shoot craps with the Department of Homeland Security. The department is too important, especially at a time like this when ISIS is killing Americans and terror cells are being uncovered around the world.\n\nThe huge department includes Customs and Border Protection, the Secret Service, Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Coast Guard. Which one of these agencies do Republicans in the House and Senate consider dispensable at the moment?\n\nThese are serious times that call for serious leaders, and, up to now, McConnell hasn\u2019t seemed up to the challenge. He hasn\u2019t had the courage to stand up to the more ideological members of the Senate Republican Caucus, or the common sense to come up with a practical solution to the logjam.\n\nAnd while the Senate majority leader finally did come up with a way to give Senate Democrats what they want to end their filibuster of a House bill that blocks funding for Obama\u2019s executive actions, the truth is that he could have put this proposal on the table weeks ago.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a month since House Republicans\u2014along with two Democrats\u2014started taking hostages in their rhetorical shoving match with the White House. Ten Republicans broke with their party and voted no on the bill to block funding for the executive actions.\n\n\n\nAnd now, conservatives have stupidly painted themselves into a corner, framing the debate over Obama\u2019s executive action in terms that are so all-or-nothing that any wavering will be seen by conservative media and rank-and-file Republican voters as caving in. And above all, Republican lawmakers are terrified of being accused of that. So they have no choice but to press ahead, even at the risk of jeopardizing homeland security.\n\nThat\u2019s where we are. It\u2019s a complete abdication of leadership by Speaker John Boehner and the House Republicans\u2014one that briefly found support among far-right Senate Republicans who were more than happy to give aid and comfort to the lunatic fringe of their party, and some of whom may yet come back around to that view. All because they\u2019re afraid of having to go home to their districts and face angry voters. That\u2019s the prison that Republicans find themselves in, and it\u2019s of their own making.\n\n\n\nMcConnell had the right idea. You need to separate homeland security from the immigration debate. In Congress\u2014just like at PTA meetings, and Little League games, and on talk radio\u2014the immigration issue makes Americans crazy. Pick up a history book. It has always had that effect on us, no matter who the immigrants were or what country they were coming from. Even so, our enemies don\u2019t pause for politics. And, given that irrefutable fact, homeland security is too important to be held for ransom.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:48.950+0000"}

After all, presidents need to be free to conduct high-level negotiations, hold summits, and the like. Hitting them personally is akin to conducting a kind of economic or diplomatic assassination. \u201cSo we do not begin these types of sanctions efforts with a head of state.\u201d\n\nThe Russians, in turn, did not sanction any senior administration officials when they retaliated Thursday, topping their list with one senior advisor to Obama, Dan Pfeiffer, and two mid-level White House staffers, Caroline Atkinson and Ben Rhodes. Even anti-Russian U.S. diplomats such as Assistant Secretary of State for Europe Victoria Nuland were spared in an effort to respond proportionally and to maintain the ability of diplomats to do their work going forward.\n\nBut if Putin ever steps down\u2014perhaps after his 3rd term as president in 2018\u2014Ivanov tops the list of those who could replace him, according to a report by Foundation Stanislav Belkovsky, the research organization named after the Russian political scientist and communications professional of the same name.\n\nIvanov\u2019s ties to Putin go back to 1976, when they both served in the Leningrad Oblast KGB Directorate. He was Putin\u2019s deputy when Putin was director of the Federal Security Service in 1998-99. In 2001, Putin made Ivanov Russia\u2019s first civilian defense minister, a post he held until 2007.\n\n\u201cWe remember quote clearly that from February to September 2007, Mr. Ivanov used to be the most likely candidate in the \u2018race of Putin\u2019s successors,\u2019 but then the National Leader (Mr. Putin) chose to advance Dmitry Medvedev,\u201d reads a 2013 Foundation report, reviewed by The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cIt is a highly unusual and rather extraordinary case for the United States to sanction a head of state of another country. So we do not begin these types of sanctions efforts with a head of state.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Putin gave the job of chief of the presidential administration to Ivanov, \u201cwho, according to Putin\u2019s basic judgment, thus received his compensation for having been humiliated in 2007,\u201d the report stated. That\u2019s when \u201cIvanov had been the last to learn that he would not to become the President\u2019s successor because the coveted post had been given to Medvedev.\u201d\n\nIn between his close brush with the presidency in 2007 and his return to Putin\u2019s inner circle in 2011, Ivanov strengthened his position inside the highest ranks of the Russian political aristocracy. Despite having a relatively minor position for a once-presidential contender, Ivanov used his post as Deputy Prime Minister for the Defense Industrial Complex to increase his personal wealth and build support in the business community.\n\n\u201cSome say that it was this job that had finally given him a chance to drink from a life-giving fountain of big money,\u201d the Foundation report stated.\n\nIvanov now has deep ties to Russian big business. His son, Sergey Ivanov, Jr. became Vice President of Gazprombank, the king-sized financial institution, and is tied to Rostelecom, the main Russian telecommunications company. Ivanov Jr. is expected to be named the next CEO of Gazprombank.\n\nThere are other contenders to replace Putin in 2018 and one of them might be chosen to replace Medvedev as prime minister as soon as this year, the report stated. If Ivanov is picked, it\u2019s nearly as problematic as if he became president; prime ministers aren\u2019t supposed to be on anyone\u2019s sanction list, either.\n\nOne other possible contender is Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu, who may have the support of Vladislav Surkov, the \u201cgray cardinal\u201d of the Kremlin, who is influential and close to Putin on several issues, including Ukraine. Surkov, who is on the U.S. sanctions list, is of Chechen ethnicity.\n\nAlexey Kurdin, the current Minister of Finance, is also said to want Medvedev\u2019s job, in advance of later replacing Putin, according to the Foundation report. Another contender could be Dmitry Rogozin, the current Deputy Prime Minister for the Defense Industrial Complex, who laughed off the fact that he was the target of U.S. sanctions this week.\n\nBut Rogozin is a long shot, according to the Foundation analysis, because of his historical clashes with members of the Rodina, or National Patriotic Party, in 2007 and his effort to raise millions from oligarchs for a \u201cpeaceful revolution\u201d in Russia in 2005-06. \u201cRogozin\u2019s promising political career exists primarily in the imagination of his close relatives,\u201d the Foundation wrote.\n\nThe conventional wisdom inside the Kremlin is that if Putin relinquishes the presidency in 2018\u2014and that\u2019s a major if\u2014he could stay on again as prime minister or another role that allows him to maintain control.\n\n\u201cMr. Putin now sends his close company and the lobbying parties messages of the following character: quite possibly I will not go away in 2018 so do not get involved in competing for my throne too soon,\u201d the Foundation report said.\n\nBut if Ivanov does become President or Prime Minister, he won\u2019t be able to come to the United States under the current sanctions regime, promising cool relations between Washington and Moscow well into the next decade.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:49.217+0000"}

Bush is easily one of the most controversial artists of our time. Think Banksy\u2014if he were a war criminal. And now, thanks to Architectural Digest, which features the 43rd president\u2019s \u201cSerene Texas Retreat\u201d in its August issue, we get to see where he creates his masterpieces.\n\n\n\nArchitectural Digest wouldn\u2019t make the image available to The Daily Beast, but you can see it right here, on their website.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. Bush sometimes paints at an easel in the enclosed breezeway, where the windows are replaced with screens in warm weather; the ottoman and the cushions on the sea-grass chairs are covered in Sunbrella fabrics,\u201d the magazine informs.\n\nOne could easily envision a paint-covered Bush standing at the easel, one hand holding a brush, the other resting thoughtfully on his chin, while he gazes out the window.\n\nOn the easel sits a depiction of sun shining through trees, illuminating the grass below. Leaning against the windows are another painting of a tree, one of a cat in a cardboard box, and one I can\u2019t quite make out that appears to be a pond encircled by some rocks.\n\nBush\u2019s art is also used to decorate the home: Two portraits of dogs adorn the study.\n\nBush\u2019s hobby was first revealed in a 2012 New York Magazine profile of his brother Jeb, which detailed that in his quiet post-presidency life, \u201che\u2019s taken up painting, making portraits of dogs and arid Texas landscapes.\u201d The publication quoted a former aide divulging that they found it \u201cstunning that he has the patience to sit and take instruction and paint.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s actual paintings were not revealed to the world until the following year, when the hacker Guccifer (now jailed) broke into several email accounts associated with the former president and leaked his findings to the media.\n\nBush depicted himself standing in the shower, his face reflected in a small, circular mirror; and in the bath, his knees and toes poking out of the water. A photograph showed Bush hunched over an easel in what appears to be a home gym.\n\nThe self-portraits in particular confounded the art world, who reviewed them in unflattering terms like \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and \u201cpedestrian.\u201d\n\nBut the haters could not stop the rise of George W. Bush: artist. In April, an exhibit of his paintings, The Art of Leadership: A President\u2019s Personal Diplomacy, opened at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum on the campus of Southern Methodist University, featuring dozens of portraits including Vladimir Putin, Tony Blair, former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, and Junichiro Koizumi, the former prime minister of Japan. Bush was modest about his works, offering that he is \u201cnot a great artist.\u201d\n\nIt was not long before people noticed that Bush had based his portraits on the top Google Image search results of his subjects\u2014often from Wikipedia pages. Critic Greg Allen wrote, \u201cby outsourcing the editorial decisions about the source images to Google and Wikipedia, the rest of the paintings\u2019 decisions can be claimed by The Decider himself.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:49.621+0000"}
{"entityId": 1703, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "While most of the mainstream media have been wringing its hands over Donald Trump, his type of phenomenon is a great American pastime.\n\nThe well-known thinker Bill O\u2019Reilly has thought it over and issued a report on the state of the American press. The news is not good.\n\nThe report arrived two or three weeks ago, gift-wrapped as a present for the high-riding Republican front-runner Donald Trump, a scorched-earth attack on Trump\u2019s old nemesis, the news. As regular devotees of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show understand, Mr. O\u2019s gifts tend to arrive with a self-interest clause, a \u201csomething-we-can-both-use\u201d aroma about them, which is something like presenting the lady of the house with a French maid costume for your anniversary, or Ralph Kramden giving Alice a bowling ball for Valentine\u2019s. If you do not know who Bill O\u2019Reilly and Ralph Kramden are, by the way, do yourself a favor and find out who Ralph Kramden is very soon.\n\nBut I have strayed. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s assessment is that the American press \u201cdespises\u201d The Donald for the following reasons:\n\nBecause he has no fear.\n\nBecause he could not care less about censoring himself.\n\nBecause the press does not intimidate him, and because of that approach the media believe they must punish Mr. Trump for being disrespectful and not cowering before them, plus they don\u2019t like his politics, generally speaking.\n\nAll of that in quotation marks. O\u2019Reilly, word for word.\n\nAnd that being the case, those of us in the flock already know that O\u2019Reilly\u2019s defense of Donald Trump is not really about Donald Trump (yes, I realize that this thing I have about watching O\u2019Reilly is getting out of hand. It is like being addicted to the same 60-minute infomercial day after day, only there is more stuff to buy) but Mr. O himself. Still, who else\u2014what other journalist, present or past\u2014would call for a nationwide change in the civil laws to make it easier for celebrities to sue newspapers for invasion of privacy, because 11 years ago he was forced to settle a seven-figure sexual harassment suit out of court, and the specifics of the harassment charges showed up in detail in the press? Mr. O vowed never to talk about it again, and didn\u2019t want anybody else to talk about it either.\n\nBut talk they did\u2014particularly the tabloids\u2014admittedly without much sympathy, and O\u2019Reilly has been angling to protect public figures from the First Amendment ever since.\n\nWhere else am I supposed to go to watch something like that?\n\nBut I continue to stray. Mr. O has not finished assailing the press. The press, he says, \u201cis a very powerful force in America\u201d\u2014huh?\u2014and \u201cif (the press) deems someone unworthy, they will try to destroy that person\u2026\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the American media\u2014although there are exceptions\u2014are not looking out for you. They have an agenda, these people, and they often use that agenda in corrupt ways.\u201d\n\n***\n\n\n\nOuch.\n\nThis looks to me like a misunderstanding, which means that I\u2019m not sure putting a clown\u2019s nose on Donald Trump\u2019s picture and running it on the front page signals the kind of all-in, Old Testament hate that O\u2019Reilly thinks it does.\n\nThe relevant case, as I think they say in court, goes back not quite to the Old Testament, but close. Nineteen forty-seven. The war is over, television has begun its invasion and professional wrestling has caught America\u2019s eye. The country is taking a break, a little quiet time between wars. It is still two years before the world will first hear Bill O\u2019Reilly scream. America needs a new rallying point, something to unite against until the next war, and up steps a 22-year-old eighth-grade dropout named George Raymond Wagner.\n\nGorgeous George.\n\nGorgeous is not much to look at\u2014five-eight or so, 210 pounds, pale-skinned and dimpled with fat, nothing to brag about even in wrestlers of television\u2019s first, pre-steroids, era. Yet George has something that Haystacks Calhoun and the others don\u2019t. He has an idea. And hair. Long, blond, 100-strokes-a-night tresses, which he primps at like a movie star in and out of the ring, often over the bodies of his victims.\n\nAnd cheat? He gouges you in the eyes, kicks you in the spine (strangely enough, nobody ever got kicked in the lap in those days), rakes your ears, your nose, your eyebrows, pulls down your wrestling tights when the referee isn\u2019t looking, and sometimes yes, pulls hair. Strangely, nobody ever seems to pull his back. But that\u2019s not all. Most of the brutalized are clean-cut, follow-the-rules American boys, some just home from the war. Does Gorgeous care?\n\nHe cuts off the referee\u2019s view and uses a string hidden in his trunks for strangling, then judo-chops you in the Adam\u2019s apple. He gives you the business with his middle knuckle, he bites and pinches. He mauls you and then runs out of the ring like a coward when you get mad, and two minutes later, he is flying off the top rope at the corner ring post and mashing your kidneys with the heels of his wrestling boots.\n\nAnd afterwards, he primps. An assistant brings him a mirror, and if the referee and the wrestling officials turn their backs, he sneaks around behind them and kicks you in the head again, just to be kicking somebody in the head, and even as America screams for his blood, Gorgeous is taking in the money. He relieves the announcer of his microphone and brags to the mob that he is not only the greatest wrestler in the world but also the most beautiful, desirable man in America.\n\nBy now, at the height of his detestation (popularity\u2014what\u2019s the difference?) Gorgeous is demanding\u2014and getting\u201450 present of the gate everywhere he wrestles. He marries a girl named Betty Hanson in the wrestling ring and draws the largest audience that has ever watched anything on television, and when it works he does it again and again, in rings all across the country.\n\n***\n\nStill, like anything else, it ends. The glory years are over. George retires in 1962, losing his last match to The (masked) Destroyer, and, following to the special rules of the contest, trims his flowing, blond fleece to the scalp. In one year out of the spotlight, Gorgeous George drinks himself to death. Forty-eight years old, it makes you sad, thinking of how much fun he left behind.\n\nThe life however is not wasted. George spawns thousands of braggarts. Generations of them ride the nation\u2019s derision, some to wealth and fame. Empty r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, invented pasts, half-truths. One of them, a young light-heavyweight boxer named Cassius Clay, confuses the genre by making good on every promise, not only in the ring but out, beginning when thousands of Americans shell out exorbitant pay-for-view prices all over the country to watch his public execution by Sonny Liston\u2014the scariest black man in the world, an 8-to-1 favorite. And now who to root for? The kid with the mouth makes it confusing to be a racist.\n\nHe beats Sonny Liston of course, twice. Clay becomes Ali, who becomes a serious man, and I think probably a great man, and his reach goes farther than even he intended. A long way beyond boxing. And the truth is, that ruins the fun. At least for those of us who have to turn away toward the end out of fear that he will be hurt.\n\nLuckily, there is only one Ali, and only one Gorgeous George. Hundreds of pale imitations, some of them old men still out there slinging hash, bragging, pretending to be what they\u2019re not. Some of them forgetting that they are pretenders. The beauty of it, you don\u2019t ever worry about any of them getting hurt, because there\u2019s nothing there but vanity. Nothing to keep you from enjoying the show.\n\nWhat is more fun for the audience than of them getting huffy and accusing the press of \u201ccorruption\u201d for putting a clown\u2019s nose on a clown?\n\nBooing has always been half the fun.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:50.223+0000"}

Things that Trump doesn\u2019t like\u2014such as Macy\u2019s, Arianna Huffington, and The Daily Beast\u2014are either losing money or they\u2019re a \u201cdummy,\u201d another favorite Trump-ism. Much like his campaign, Trump\u2019s Twitter feed is a parade of self-aggrandizement, swipes at reporters, and childish barbs.\n\nBut if the presidential election was a Twitter popularity contest\u2014and thank God it\u2019s not\u2014one thing is clear: Trump would win by a landslide. The Donald would probably take this as a compliment but there\u2019s no one better at Twitter than he is. The relationship between Trump and Twitter is the perfect marriage of man and medium: his terse insults are perfectly suited to the 140-character form and his controversy-a-day campaign feeds off of Twitter\u2019s short attention span. Marshall McLuhan\u2019s reminder that \u201cthe medium is the message\u201d has never been more relevant, or more embarrassing.\n\nJust how well is Trump doing on Twitter?\n\nAccording to PolitiTrends data, Trump has been the most tweeted-about candidate by a wide margin for the last month, frequently becoming the subject of 70,000 tweets per day while his competitors flounder in the 20,000 range. He has 3.43 million Twitter followers, surpassed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s 3.97 million, but according to an analysis by Vocativ he has a much higher percentage of authentic, non-robot Twitter followers (90 percent) than the Democratic front-runner (65 percent). The Talkwalker report provided to The Daily Beast also shows that he has been retweeted 1.86 million times since he first stepped off of that escalator on June 16.\n\nTrump has been the most tweeted-about candidate by a wide margin for the last month, frequently becoming the subject of 70,000 tweets per day while his competitors flounder in the 20,000 range.\n\nHis net worth might be less than he claims but on Twitter, Trump is exactly as large as he appears.\n\nThe size of Trump\u2019s Twitter empire can almost certainly be attributed to his Apprentice-driven celebrity status prior to his campaign. Back in May, he was already approaching 3 million followers. After all, Twitter is where people come to gawk at their favorite reality stars\u2014the more unhinged and unfiltered the better\u2014and The Donald is no exception. More so than any other social media network, Twitter is a spectator sport, an arena where blows are exchanged before our eyes. And Trump never fails to supply the drama.\n\nFor example, after saying that John McCain was \u201cnot a war hero\u201d in mid-July\u2014a gaffe that some thought might end his campaign\u2014Trump took to Twitter, not to apologize, but to double down on his attack.\n\nWhen he took exception to The Daily Beast\u2019s reporting on an alleged incident between himself and his ex-wife Ivana described in Harry Hurt III\u2019s 1993 book Lost Tycoon as \u201crape,\u201d Trump went after Hurt on Twitter, publicly calling him a \u201cdummy dope.\u201d\n\nIn social media lingo, we might call this \u201cTwitter gold,\u201d the absolute peak of the social network\u2019s well-known propensity for drama. What would Twitter be without public figures like Trump who regularly launch into unexpected and unscripted diatribes on a moment\u2019s notice? In its finest moments, Twitter is a delivery mechanism for journalism and jokes but, at its worst, it is a global high school where bullies have armies and gossip can never be whispered, only shouted. And it\u2019s this latter version of Twitter where Trump reigns supreme.\n\nYou could say it\u2019s his natural element.\n\nBut Trump is nothing if not consistent in his erraticism and his Twitter rants have become a vital part of his brand.\n\nThe other presidential candidates are barred by the standards of human decorum from even considering a challenge to Trump\u2019s Twitter throne. Campaign stuffers are almost certainly managing their social media accounts whereas Trump himself\u2014or someone who has his voice perfected\u2014seems to be the one posting on @realDonaldTrump. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about Trump\u2019s Twitter account.)\n\nBut this also means that nothing interesting ever happens on the other candidates\u2019 carefully-curated Twitters where boilerplate quotes, logo spam, infographics, and tired hashtag campaigns are the name of the game.\n\nIt\u2019s hard (but perhaps also a little amusing) to picture Bernie Sanders letting loose on CNN and loudly calling people \u201cdummies.\u201d\n\nWith Trump, you might not get what you want but much like the proverbial box of chocolates, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get. And in the wilds of Twitter, the element of surprise still trumps all else.\n\nAs proof that Trump\u2019s Twitter is the medium\u2019s perfect drama-generating machine, consider his most frequently discussed topic: According to the Talkwalker report, Donald Trump\u2019s most-tweeted term since he called Mexican immigrants \u201crapists\u201d in his announcement speech is \u201cMacy\u2019s\u201d\u2014except, of course, for the words in his campaign slogan and generic words like \u201cpeople\u201d or \u201ccountry.\u201d\n\nIn early July, the department store dropped Trump\u2019s clothing brand due to his disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants, which predictably sent Trump on a Twitter tear. Over the last month, he has urged a boycott of the store, accused them of losing money (a cardinal sin in Trumpland), and tried to connect the store to the ongoing Planned Parenthood controversy:\n\nEach of these tweets has the power to launch a hundred replies and a dozen news posts. Trump almost certainly knows that and embraces it. Why should he use his Twitter for something other than settling grudge matches when all he apparently has to do to maintain his current level of support is bloviate?\n\nAs the country waits to hear how, exactly, Trump would #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, his campaign feeds on the perpetual controversy that only Twitter can supply. And for his loyal supporters, it doesn\u2019t matter what Trump says so much as how he says it.\n\nNowhere does this emphasis on tone over substance play more perfectly than on Twitter. Trump\u2019s brash, insulting online persona gives off the illusion of a straight shooter, someone unafraid to say what he thinks, and it\u2019s precisely that image that has helped him become the unexpected front-runner in the pre-primary polls. If Trump were the sort of candidate who made gaffes on television and apologized for them on Twitter, his campaign would have been over by now. But Trump is nothing if not consistent in his erraticism and his Twitter rants have become a vital part of his brand.\n\nIn fairness, Trump does use his Twitter for purposes besides bullying. When Wired examined the most influential anti-vaccine Twitter users who posted on their primary #CDCwhistleblower hashtag at its height, they found that Donald Trump\u2014himself an anti-vaxxer celebrity icon\u2014was one of the 10 most influential, with over 10 million impressions.\n\nPerhaps we should be grateful that Trump tweets more about Macy\u2019s than about policy.\n\nUltimately, there are no easy answers here, only the mirthless observation that Trump has found a technology that completes him and a platform where he has far more influence than any of the people who could actually become president. Trump and Twitter were made for each other and, as his poll numbers surge, that terrible symbiosis is more concerning than ever.

Then came accusations of centrism\u2014now a dirty word in a party with an energized left flank.\n\nThere are a couple of hundred well turned out, professional women sipping $9 white wines at the Sheraton Hotel in downtown Philadelphia, and Allyson Schwartz is determined to kiss every single one of them on the cheek.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard, as they are all gathered for a fundraiser for a nearly 40-year-old women\u2019s health group that Schwartz helped found, and so she seems to know half the room.\n\n\u201cI tell everyone, \u2018Vote for my girl, vote for my girl!\u2019\u201d says one older woman after emerging from her own cheek peck.\n\nAnother grabs Schwartz by the shoulders and looks searchingly into her face. \u201cTell me,\u201d she implores. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d\n\nIn eight days, the voters of Pennsylvania have a chance to make Schwartz the first female governor in the state\u2019s history. Last year, the five-term congresswoman and political powerbroker from the upper reaches of Philadelphia and its wealthy northern suburbs was up by as much as 25 points and looked like a shoo-in for the Democratic nomination. With Republican incumbent Tom Corbett notching some of the lowest approval ratings in the country, Schwartz could have been forgiven if she had started to measure the drapes in Harrisburg.\n\nNow she is down by nearly that much. While her campaign was buried under an avalanche of gauzy television advertisements from wealthy businessman Tom Wolf, who now holds a commanding lead in the polls, the Schwartz campaign was knocked off course by a surprising incident toward the end of last year.\n\nIn an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, two leaders of Third Way, a pro-business, centrist Democratic group that listed Schwartz as an \u201chonorary co-chair,\u201d warned the Democratic Party against following the example of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose elections the previous two Novembers seem to herald a new, emboldened left flank. De Blasio\u2019s and Warren\u2019s ++ideas about reducing inequality++ [], the Third Way leaders wrote, were \u201ca fantasy-based blue-state populism\u201d that would lead the party over \u201cthe populist cliff.\u201d\n\nProgressive groups and bloggers were outraged, and Schwartz\u2019s rivals, seizing on the dust-up, hammered the congresswoman for her association with the group. The campaign, her advisers acknowledge, was rattled. Schwartz eventually dropped her association with Third Way, but the polls have been trending downward ever since.\n\nSo Schwartz has come to the Sheraton, among voters she describes as \u201cmy people,\u201d to engage in hand-to-hand, or more like cheek-to-cheek, combat in the race\u2019s final days.\n\n\u201cPeople are huddled very tightly together,\u201d Schwartz says to an aide as she surveys the room. \u201cIt can be hard to find a way in.\u201d\n\nA group of two women are from New Jersey. Another group doesn\u2019t seem to recognize her. \u201cI\u2019m Allyson Schwartz. I\u2019m running for governor. Sometimes you are on TV and you just think everybody knows who you are, but they don\u2019t,\u201d she says, apologizing on their behalf.\n\nAnother woman comes up to Schwartz and introduces herself. \u201cYou have done so much for the venture capital community,\u201d she says as the congresswoman, seemingly aware of a reporter\u2019s presence, smiles tightly.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, sitting around an enormous circular table that her spokesman jokes is like the Star Trek Enterprise, Schwartz didn\u2019t much want to discuss whether she was the first scalp of a newly resurgent left wing of the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s look back and analyze it later. I don\u2019t think\u2014I mean, it is so interesting to me because there are ways people challenged me at the time to be liberal to win the state, and then also challenging me to be not progressive enough to win the state. In some ways, I think that is where Pennsylvanians would want me to be, which is to be really progressive on many of the issues that we all care about together.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true\u2014at the beginning of the campaign season there was some grumbling in Pennsylvania Democratic circles that Schwartz was actually too far to the left to win a general election. But that was mainly because before Schwartz entered politics, she operated a women\u2019s clinic where abortions were performed, and she has been an unapologetic advocate for abortion rights in the years since. She was one of the earliest supporters of same-sex marriage in the Pennsylvania legislature, and she has a perfect record from a local gun control group on curbing restrictions to firearms.\n\nAnd so even as Schwartz talks about the need to increase education funding and protect the environment, it is a testament to how much the ground has shifted among Democratic partisans that unless you are willing to talk about taking a pound of flesh from Wall Street and proclaim the game rigged, it is hard to get many votes.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201990s, when Clinton was president, it gave some credence to groups like Third Way,\u201d said one local political operative. \u201cI think at the time when income inequality is such a central issue and we have gone through the financial collapse and it seems like Wall Street was responsible for it, the country just isn\u2019t there anymore. Groups that have been pushing Democrats to be more corporate-friendly at the expense of spending on social issues are living 20 years past their expiration date.\u201d\n\nHow much has the Democratic Party of Pennsylvania moved to the left? Consider this: When Schwartz won her seat in the suburbs in 2004, it was carved out to elect a Republican. She beat one and held the seat for 10 years, and now a front-runner to replace her is Daylin Leach, a state lawmaker who proudly calls himself \u201cThe Liberal Lion of Pennsylvania.\u201d Leach received the endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders and is threatening to hold a sit-in in Gov. Corbett\u2019s office to bring attention to the issue of medical marijuana.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a centrist. She wanted to run as a progressive, but her voting record and her associations disproved it,\u201d said John Hangar, a one-time candidate who before dropping out jumped on Schwartz\u2019s Third Way connections. \u201cEconomic unfairness is moving public opinion. Two years ago, proposing a $10.10 minimum wage would have made you a radical. Now it\u2019s like, \u2018We already got that.\u2019 There is something going on in the political world of the average worker that is causing them to favor strong, liberal actions, and I think Allyson probably missed that.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Schwartz backs a $10.10 minimum wage. She supported the bailout of the banks but wanted stricter oversight, too, supporting the creation of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau.\n\nBut she also thought the Bush tax cuts should be extended for everyone making less than $500,000, double what many liberals called for and more than what President Obama favored. \u201cIn my district, there are families that make $200,000 that don\u2019t feel enormously wealthy, so I was open to that discussion,\u201d she says. The government, she adds, \u201chas to create the environment for private-sector growth. Now, some progressives are critical of that. On the federal level, I have been clear: The country needs to balance its budget and deal with its debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is something going on in the political world of the average worker that is causing them to favor strong, liberal actions, and I think Allyson probably missed that.\u201d\n\nStill, she says she feels as if progressive groups wanted to make \u201can example of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was personal,\u201d she sighs. \u201cBut there it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are right-wing organizations, [and] there are progressive organizations that just care about an issue and that do use the opportunity of campaigns to push candidates further where they want to go,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is less about me than it is about pushing all the candidates further.\u201d\n\nOne of the oddities of Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial race is that there are not really many differences between the candidates. If Wolf is the liberal champion, he is something of an unlikely one, as he made a fortune in the business world and jump-started his campaign with $10 million of his own money.\n\n\u201cI think we are not so different,\u201d Schwartz says of her rivals. \u201cIt is more about personality and who we are and who comes from the most troubled background and has risen better. Who has gone to an Ivy League school and who hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAlthough polls now show Schwartz trailing, she insists there is still time and that people are just now tuning in. And so she is campaigning at a sprint. As she ducked out of the Sheraton fundraiser, she met a group of women coming at her on the up escalator. They began to applause.\n\n\u201cThank you, thank you. Tell everyone you know to vote May 20. Take the day off!\u201d\n\nShe hustled into a SUV and dashed up the Pennsylvania Turnpike toward the town of Bethlehem, making fundraising calls along the way. She was slated to speak at the local Democratic club\u2019s Jefferson Jackson Day Dinner, the only candidate in the field who bothered to show. Traffic was terrible, though, so only a few dozen people gamely remained to pick over the vegetable spread and drink beer. They listened as a political science professor at a local college explained how changing demographics were changing the region\u2019s politics, making it less \u201clabor liberal and more progressive liberal.\u201d\n\nWhen Schwartz finally arrived, she gave a version of her sunny stump speech. It was heavy on her accomplishments from her career in Congress and the legislature, and the subtext was clear: It is not anger that Pennsylvanians need, or fiery rhetoric. They need somebody who can work within the system to get something done.\n\nThe sparse crowd was full of Schwartz partisans, and they wondered why she wasn\u2019t doing better.\n\n\u201cPeople are just angry, that\u2019s all,\u201d said one local pol. \u201cThey see what is happening, and it is happening under their noses.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:51.414+0000"}
{"entityId": 1706, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Supreme Court struck down a 35-foot buffer zone law but upheld the right to impose such protections, as long as they don\u2019t infringe upon public spaces. And that\u2019s a good thing, writes Sally Kohn.\n\nOn December 30, 1994, Shannon Elizabeth Lowney was sitting at the front desk at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Brookline, Massachusetts where she worked, just doing her job, when a man named John C. Salvi entered the clinic, pulled a rifle from his bag and fatally shot Lowney in the neck. Salvi then methodically riddled the rest of the room with bullets, wounding three other people in the clinic.\n\nAfter his shooting spree, Salvi left and went to Preterm Health Services, a clinic two miles away, killing receptionist Lee Ann Nichols and wounding two other staffers.\n\nWithin an hour of the murders, a woman called the Planned Parenthood clinic in Brookline and told a staff person there, \u201cYou got what you deserved.\u201d Outside a Virginia jail where Salvi was later held after a nationwide manhunt, his supporters gathered. \u201cThank you for what you did,\u201d Donald Spitz, the director of Pro-Life Virginia, shouted into a megaphone\u2014apparently failing to grasp the profound hypocrisy that in the name of \u201clife,\u201d he was cheering on murder.\n\nIn McCullen v. Coakley, the Supreme Court was asked to weigh the legality of a Massachusetts law that bans protests within 35 feet of an entrance to an abortion clinic. Opponents of the law, including the named challenger Eleanor McCullen, argued that the law violates their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court, in its ruling today, partially agreed.\n\nBut this case had little to do with Eleanor McCullen, a grandmother in her mid-70s who, two mornings a week, dresses up in a suit and pushes a baby stroller outside an abortion clinic near Boston. The Massachusetts law wasn\u2019t written because of peaceful protesters like McCullen. It was written for people like Salvi. Anti-abortion protesters have a demonstrated history of violent intimidation, doing whatever they think it takes to physically block women from entering clinics, whether the women are there to get a check-up or to exercise their constitutional right to an abortion. Law enforcement officers support buffer zones to keep the peace. In fact, Supreme Court judges also apparently support protest buffer zones, since protest is regulated in and around the Supreme Court building. If it\u2019s constitutional to regulate protests at the Supreme Court, surely it\u2019s constitutional at health clinics, too.\n\nIf it\u2019s constitutional to regulate protests at the Supreme Court, surely it\u2019s constitutional at health clinics, too.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court in its ruling agrees, sort of. The McCullen decision strikes down the Massachusetts law because it includes public streets and sidewalks. However, in an encouraging sign for clinics\u2014and common sense\u2014the narrow ruling does not invalidate buffer zones in general. Presumably under this ruling, clinic buffer zones that are more tightly drawn and do not include public sidewalks and streets are still completely permissible under the Constitution. (There is some debate about how this will affect clinics that abut sidewalks or public streets.)\n\nThe McCullen decision follows on the heels of the Court\u2019s 2000 decision in Hill v Colorado. There, in a 6-3 ruling, the Court upheld a 1993 Colorado law creating a 100-foot buffer zone around the entrance of any health-care facility. The law also prohibited protesters from approaching within eight feet of a patient without her or his consent. The Colorado law was passed in the wake of not just peaceful protests but active harassment and personally violating confrontations. In Hill v. Colorado, the court ruled that the law served a legitimate government interest\u2014preserving the right of citizens to \u201cbe let alone\u201d\u2014and within that context, the law was sufficiently narrowly tailored to infringe on free speech as little as possible.\n\nThe Massachusetts law struck a similar, reasonable balance. As Martha Walz, head of the Planned Parenthood Leave of Massachusetts, told RH Reality Check earlier this year, \u201cLaw enforcement supports the buffer zones. They love that it works. And the protesters, they respect it.\u201d After all, protesters still get to protest\u2014while patients and clinic workers still have the right to be left alone.\n\nEven the ACLU, our nation\u2019s most steadfast defenders of the First Amendment, believe buffer zones are constitutional. Yes, free speech is a right that must be protected, says the ACLU, but so is the constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Buffer zone laws keep both rights balanced.\n\nIn fact, in its amicus brief, the ACLU compiled example after example after example of how not having a buffer zone restricted the health care rights of women. An escort at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Boston said, \u201cThe protestors are moving closer and closer to the main door. They scream and block the way for the patients to get into the clinic. We fill out police reports almost every week regarding the way they encroach upon the door, but nothing has changed\u2026They\u2019re getting so close that patients are terrified to even walk into the clinic.\u201d\n\nMichael T. Baniukiewicz, head of security for Planned Parenthood facilities in Massachusetts, reported how protesters would regularly block entrances or block parking garages or even line their bodies up alongside cars so that passengers can\u2019t get out.\n\nIn a harassment incident filed with police, a woman named Vanessa reported how protesters yelled and screamed and tried to get in her face: \u201cBad enough I was scared coming here, afraid I might get shot.\u201d\n\nUnder the McCullen ruling, thankfully, states can still act to protect the safety and constitution exercise of freedom of women and their families and loved ones. While undoubtedly this ruling will lead to much more litigation in lower courts to determine the exact implications of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, it looks like states can still take steps needed to protect women seeking abortions, including passing buffer zone laws as long as they don\u2019t explicitly include public streets and sidewalks. Which is too bad, because extremist and aggressive anti-abortion protesters don\u2019t seem to recognize any boundaries in their harassment and violent intimidation.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:52.194+0000"}

The Obama administration severed most ties with Blackwater, and Prince sold the company and uprooted to Abu Dhabi, where he continued doing sketchy work with security forces. Feeling betrayed by the Obama administration, he has since said that his days working for the U.S. government are over.\n\nBut on the subject of the federal government that he no longer wishes to work with, Prince has a rough message for the Republican Party: Get off your asses, guys. (Prince is a libertarian, staunchly Catholic conservative.)\n\n\u201cI want you to tell your congressman that we pay them to fight,\u201d Prince told the crowd. \u201cThey are hired to fight for our values, for what you sent them there to do\u2026 I am sick and tired of Republicans getting rolled\u2014having a lousy, weak leadership that gets rolled every time by the Democratic Party.

He, of course, had nothing but unkind words for the regime in Tehran, but praised the young, liberal population of the Islamic Republic.\n\n\u201cMost Iranians\u2026 are just like you guys,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to be able to drink a beer when they want, travel where they want, have their wife or girlfriend drive a car or wear a short shirt and wear high heels. I\u2019m all in favor of it.\u201d\n\nRoughly 70 percent of the country\u2019s population is under the age of 30 and has no memory of the Islamic Revolution of 1979, so the Prince characterization is\u2026 sort of on the money.\n\nBut what\u2014beside perhaps killing ISIS members\u2014could The Artist Formerly Known As Blackwater do for the world today?

On Republicans\u2019 top issues\u2014jobs and the economy\u2014the poll showed only flagging advantages, and in some cases, outright defeats. As Politico reported this week:\n\n\u201cEven on fiscal matters\u2014traditionally the party\u2019s strongest issue set\u2014Republicans hold only slight advantages that do not come close to outweighing their negative attributes. The GOP holds a 3 percent advantage over Democrats when female voters are asked who has \u201cgood ideas to grow the economy and create jobs,\u201d and the same advantage on who is \u201cfiscally responsible and can be trusted with our tax dollars.\u201d\n\n[\u2026] Female voters who care about the top four issues \u2014the economy, health care, education, and jobs\u2014vote overwhelmingly for Democrats. Most striking, Democrats hold a 35-point advantage with female voters who care about jobs and a 26 percent advantage when asked which party is willing to compromise. House Republicans say jobs and the economy are their top priorities.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it seems Republicans haven\u2019t persuaded women that the party is capable of fulfilling promises of prosperity via economic growth and job creation. What are GOP strategists\u2019 plans for improving women voters\u2019 appraisal of their economic and employment policies? For one, \u201c[Strategists] suggest Republican lawmakers criticize Democrats for \u201cgrowing government programs that encourage dependency rather than opportunities to get ahead.\u201d\n\nRepublican criticisms of the alleged Democratic failure to encourage social mobility are some of the most tired political saws around. But the Republican track record for selling their \u201cdependency\u201d narrative to women is even worse, possibly one of their most shameful, ill-faring strategies to date.\n\nIt seems every time Republicans pair their paranoia over government dependency with any kind of focus on women, a nauseating prostitution allusion simmers to the surface. Consider, for example, Mike Huckabee\u2019s infamous remarks on \u2018Uncle Sugar\u2019:\n\n\u201c\u2026Because the fact is, the Republicans don\u2019t have a war on women. They have a war FOR women. For them to be empowered; to be something other than victims of their gender. Women I know are outraged that Democrats think that women are nothing more than helpless and hopeless creatures whose only goal in life is to have a government provide for them birth control medication [\u2026] That\u2019s not a war ON them, it\u2019s a war FOR them. And if the Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control because they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government, then so be it, let\u2019s take that discussion all across America because women are far more than Democrats have made them to be\u2026\u201d\n\nHuckabee\u2019s world features two types of women: those who are smart, educated, and independent, and those who are hapless, helpless, dependent harlots, relying on Uncle Sam\u2019s licentious alter ego, Uncle Sugar. Dependency may mean sloth and parasitism at large, but in the context of women the same old smear takes on a strangely sexualized shape, with state-as-sugar-daddy and dependency-as-prostitution, or something like it. And the odd bleed between various conservative moral paranoias isn\u2019t limited to discussions of women\u2019s health care.\n\nThe \u201cwelfare queen\u201d may be the coup-de-grace of Republican dependency animus, a coalescence of every ounce of fear and loathing for the ostensibly indolent that Reaganites could muster. The idea of the welfare queen has been enormously successful, clinging even now to the public imagination when assistance programs are debated. While the image of the welfare queen has been called out for its racialized components, it\u2019s worth nothing that it\u2019s also a heavily gendered, markedly sexualized vision of dependency.\n\nBecause the \u201cwelfare queen\u201d of stereotypical lore is imagined to rely on the state for support instead of a husband, people tend to see women who use welfare as having failed to aptly live out \u201cfamily ethics.\u201d The association between state and husband in conservative dependency mythology goes a long way to intimating a pernicious pseudo-sexual relationship between the woman welfare recipient and the \u201cwelfare regime,\u201d such as it is. No such accusations tend to fall upon male welfare recipients who, though they may be construed as deadbeats or losers, at least aren\u2019t depicted as ersatz prostitutes.\n\nSo the dependency story is strange and uneven, and especially nasty when it comes to women. It probably isn\u2019t such a slam-dunk rhetorical strategy for luring women voters into the Republican fold. Why rely on it?\n\nBecause Republican policies themselves genuinely do not favor the interests of women. Though even Republican voters favor policies to secure the jobs and income of working families, the Democrat-sponsored FAMILY Act, which would actually protect working moms from job loss and severe income reduction, remains stalled in Congress. Unsurprisingly, the biggest opponents to the possibility of paid parental leave are conservatives\u2014take, for instance, the parental leave-position detailed in the reformocon handbook Room to Grow, a policy publication produced by the YG Network this year:\n\n\u201cProponents claim this program would inexpensively provide needed assistance to those lacking paid leave, and would particularly benefit women by providing paid maternity leave. But while it would assist some women, it would also disrupt the employment con- tracts of the majority of working Americans who currently have leave benefits. This new federal entitlement would encourage businesses currently providing paid leave programs\u2014including more generous leave packages\u2014to cease doing so.\u201d\n\nWhich is to say: Though paid leave would absolutely help women with the least income and most unstable employment, it might cause companies with highly paid female employees to offer less cushy benefits to those wealthy women. It\u2019s a long-form version of \u201cI\u2019ve got mine, you get yours\u201d\u2014a brush-off of epic proportions, and one that harms working mothers more than any other population. With policy positions like these, Republicans can rely on the same old destructive narratives all they want, but women voters are unlikely to be fooled by bad storytelling or awful family policy.

Paul\u2019s task is this: keep the supporters he inherited from his father happy while converting enough new supporters to win.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going so well in Iowa, where Paul will land on April 10 as part of his \u201cNational Stand with Rand Tour,\u201d wherein he is expected to formally declare, on April 7 in Kentucky, that he is running for president.\n\nMany of Rand\u2019s father\u2019s operatives linger, and all has not been forgotten on the ground in Iowa.\n\nPolitico\u2019s Ben Schreckinger reported on March 26 that Drew Ivers, the chairman of the elder Paul's 2012 campaign in Iowa, has already jumped ship because of Paul\u2019s shape-shifting: \u201cHe\u2019s moderating most of [his positions], not taking a real clear stance on a number of them,\u201d Ivers told Schreckinger. \u201cThe strategy of sending a blended message is one that has risk.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Paul has lost the support of Iowa Ron Paul-ites State Senator Jason Shultz and former Iowa GOP central committee members Chad Steenhoek and Joel Kurtinitis, Schreckinger reported. All three of them view Ted Cruz, who announced his candidacy last week, as the greener pasture.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s being pulled in two different directions,\u201d Craig Robinson, a former chairman of the Iowa GOP, told me of Paul.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, he wants to be more mainstream, but every step he takes to be more mainstream puts him in conflict with his father\u2019s base of supporters.\u201d\n\nRobinson said it seems unlikely such a plan could succeed in Iowa.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really kind of, in Iowa, running a two-pronged campaign. How do you keep two sets of people happy who don\u2019t see eye to eye?\u201d\n\nIn particular, Iowa caucus voters\u2014of whom there are only about 150,000 for the candidates to claw each other to the death over\u2014tend to value social conservatism more than the \u201clibertarian-ish\u201d stuff he\u2019s selling. In a sense Ted Cruz, slimy and demonic as he may be, possesses exactly what Paul needs: the feeling of a party outsider, but with evangelical credibility. Paul\u2019s awkward attempts to reassure both groups that he is one of them will inevitably, it seems, leave at least one feeling cold.\n\nWe saw a preview of this awkwardness just last week, when Paul met with a group of evangelical leaders to discuss gay marriage. He told them he believed Washington should play a role in fixing the \u201cmoral crisis\u201d\u2014a remarkable shift from his usual libertarian-approved position, which is that the federal government should stay the hell out of it. But Paul\u2019s phrasing was really all about the crowd he was addressing. After the talk, his campaign assured me and other reporters that despite what it sounded like, Paul still believed what he always believed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult to keep the Ron Paul supporters from 2008 and 2012 happy. Yes, they\u2019re libertarians, but I also think in their nature they\u2019re a little contrarian: Supporting Ron Paul was kind of giving the middle finger to the establishment. Rand Paul wants to be viewed as a sort of respectable person who can win the nomination.\u201d Ron Paul supporters, Robinson admitted, \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t like it if you said [voting for him] was a protest vote, but in some sense it was appealing.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s camp, of course, denies that mastering this bizarre game is difficult.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much ado about nothing!\u201d Steve Grubbs, Paul\u2019s Iowa strategist, told me by phone. \u201cWe have called through to many [party] chairs, we have seen polling data, and Rand Paul is doing very well with former Ron Paul voters. It\u2019s a pretty good base, and I can tell you this: The plan for Rand Paul is not to rely solely on Ron Paul voters. He has an appeal to voters that supported his father and voters that didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nGrubbs and the rest of Paul-World claim to view his ability to be an ideological chameleon as having no downside. \u201cThere were a lot of people who were favorable to Ron Paul but were not convinced he could win. Rand Paul brings in a whole new group of voters who understand that he could take this all the way to the White House,\u201d Grubbs said.\n\nBeyond the question of whether or not Paul\u2019s attempt to fool\u2014or convince, if you are so kind\u2014various groups of voters into thinking he represents them will be successful in Iowa, there is the question of whether the ghosts of his dad\u2019s last campaign could come back to haunt them.\n\nIn 2012 just before the caucus, State Senator Kent Sorenson, a well-known Michele Bachmann supporter, abruptly jumped ship to join Ron Paul\u2019s movement. His support, it turned out, had been purchased for $73,000 (legal technically, but a violation of Iowa ethics rules).\n\nEmails were later leaked implying that Jesse Benton, the campaign chairman, knew of the payments. In the wake of Sorenson\u2019s guilty plea in 2014, Benton (who denied multiple interview requests for this article) resigned from the campaign of Mitch McConnell. To make matters more complicated: Benton wasn\u2019t just a Paul campaign operative, but, having married Ron Paul\u2019s granddaughter, he was family. And he was expected to eventually join Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nWhile it seems Benton will have no role in the upcoming race, many of Rand\u2019s father\u2019s operatives linger, and all has not been forgotten on the ground in Iowa.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very clear that the [2012] campaign operated very fast and loose,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThe fact that Rand has guys who are wrapped up in that would concern me greatly.\u201d All it would take to \u201cderail a campaign\u201d like Paul\u2019s, he went on, would be \u201cone little news story or investigation into one of these guys.\u201d\n\nA source close to both Ron and Rand Paul told me that what happened in Iowa in 2012 should not be of concern to those considering supporting Rand in 2016: \u201cNo one who works for Senator Paul has been accused of anything. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to say, \u2018Well, they probably didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but he should have kept Ron\u2019s people off his team three and a half years later.\u2019\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:53.563+0000"}

Now the GOP Senate nominee wants voters to know she\u2019s the nicest candidate in the race.\n\nFor Joni Ernst, Iowa nice isn\u2019t just a saying, it\u2019s a campaign strategy.\n\nIn a Midwestern state where being neighborly and friendly is perhaps the supreme virtue, the Republican state senator has turned a U.S. Senate race once considered a lock for Democrats into a dead heat by ignoring issues and just focusing on being the nicest candidate running.\n\nErnst, a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard who served in Iraq, secured victory in a competitive primary by staking out unapologetically conservative positions in order not only to win but to receive the 35 percent of the vote necessary to avoid a state nominating convention. For the general election, Ernst, who rose to national attention with a television commercial in which she talked about castrating pigs, now seems intent on softening her right-wing image while working to portray her opponent, Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley as, well, a jerk.\n\nBraley has come under attack during the campaign for suggesting that Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley shouldn\u2019t chair the Senate Judiciary Committee because he\u2019s a farmer who didn\u2019t attend law school, and for allegedly threatening to sue a neighbor when her chickens repeatedly wandered into his yard. But the Democrat also has gone on the offensive, attempting to paint Ernst as a right-wing extremist for comments she has made in favor of nullification and impeaching Obama.\n\nAt the Iowa State Fair on Friday, Ernst made a relatively rare appearance on the campaign trail to put her \u201cIowa nice\u201d strategy to the test. The one major political setpiece of the day was a speech to a large crowd at the Des Moines Register\u2019s soapbox, where Ernst put on a masterful performance. She prefaced her remarks by stating that she was not going to give \u201ca campaign political speech.\u201d Of course, that was exactly what she proceeded to do, giving a heartfelt tribute to veterans and those in the armed services and taking only the slightest detour into the VA scandal.\n\nThe first-term Iowa state senator reflected on her service in Iraq and talked up about the accomplishments of the unit she led, the 1168th Transportation Company, before getting choked up telling the story of a fellow Iowan, Jamie Kearney, whom she counseled into joining the National Guard and who was killed in action while deployed in Iraq. Ernst\u2019s speech didn\u2019t just provoke a strong reaction from the crowd but managed to quiet the crowds of protesters in the audience, many of whom held signs saying \u201cOil Companies for Joni.\u201d They\u2019d showed up ready to heckle at the same location where Mitt Romney was goaded into saying, \u201cCorporations are people, my friend.\u201d Instead, throughout her speech, the signs slowly sagged.\n\nMost of the crowd was made up of a surprising number of fellow veterans, many of whom had served with Ernst overseas. Dave Bredensteiner of Bedford, who served under the lieutenant colonel in Iraq, praised her effusively as an excellent leader. Although Bredensteiner said he almost certainly would have supported Ernst if he hadn\u2019t known her\u2014he described himself as a Rick Perry/Sarah Palin Republican, not a Mitch McConnell/John McCain Republican\u2014he was effusive about his former CO, whom he described as always being a good officer who worked tirelessly.\n\n\u201cAs a woman, you don\u2019t get to be a lieutenant colonel without having some real leadership skills,\u201d said Branstad.\n\nDon Pugsley, a heavily tattooed Army veteran from Des Moines and a longtime volunteer for the Ernst campaign, said he found it particularly noteworthy that everyone under Ernst\u2019s command came back safely from Iraq. \u201cOne hundred fifty Iowans went in, and 150 came back,\u201d he said. Pugsley acknowledged that part of it might have been luck, but he said he thought the GOP Senate candidate deserved credit, too. He also noted how positively Ernst had been received on the campaign trail, with the only exception, he said, when the patrons of a gay bar came out to heckle her during a parade.\n\nErnst is just as popular among Iowa politicians, who see her as the party\u2019s best chance to win a Senate seat that has been held by outgoing incumbent Tom Harkin for 30 years. Rep. Steve King kvelled to The Daily Beast about the Republican nominee\u2019s credentials. \u201cShe\u2019s a lieutenant colonel, she\u2019s a mom, she\u2019s a grandma, she\u2019s a good shot, she knows agriculture and livestock\u2026If I were Bruce Braley, I\u2019d wonder how I could attack her.\u201d But, King added, with Ernst\u2019s impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9, \u201cwhere do you find the chink and how try to undermine Joni Ernst?\u201d\n\nIowa\u2019s five-term governor, Terry Branstad, appeared to share King\u2019s enthusiasm and suggested that Ernst\u2019s gender made her accomplishments all the more rare. \u201cAs a woman, you don\u2019t get to be a lieutenant colonel without having some real leadership skills,\u201d said Branstad. He contrasted her favorably with Braley, saying that while she was \u201chumble and hardworking\u201d and had \u201cthe right background, right temperament,\u201d the congressman had an \u201centitlement attitude.\u201d\n\nErnst echoed those statements when she spoke to reporters, putting aside Iowa nice to note that Braley \u201cdoesn\u2019t like it that I am a strong independent female leader\u201d and scoffing at his campaign\u2019s attacks on issues like her opposition to a raise in the minimum wage or mooting Obama\u2019s impeachment as \u201ca distraction.\u201d She cited no specific examples of Braley\u2019s gaffes, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have to elaborate on [how out of touch Braley is]. Look at the statements he has made.\u201d She then seemed to realize it was time to be nice again and pivoted back to her small-town roots, boasting, \u201cI live in a house that one of my best friends grew up in back in Red Oak, Iowa.\u201d\n\nThe GOP Senate nominee generally radiated a sunny disposition with reporters, though. It appeared nothing could wipe a smile off of her face, whether she was proclaiming that she felt \u201cfantastic\u201d about her race or dodging a question about whether she\u2019d support McConnell as Republican leader in the Senate if elected by saying, \u201cI am not there yet. We will see who comes through these elections and who doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nYet Ernst never quite looked like a political natural. While she greeted a woman who had won a raffle to spend the day with her like a long-lost sister, Ernst never quite threw herself into the crowds at the State Fair like other politicians often do. Instead, she appeared almost to fade into the crowd at times.\n\nThe one time Ernst seemed to feel most at home at the fair was when, walking down an empty road with cars parked down the side of it, she ran into an old friend from Red Oak. Alan Spencer, a high school ag teacher, was in his socks, getting ready to take a nap in his van before he saw Ernst. They embraced as they ran down the list of Red Oak residents at the fair. Ernst knew one, didn\u2019t know another, and was sure a third was friends with her cousin.\n\nAfterward, Spencer reminisced to The Daily Beast about a woman he first got to know well on a 1989 student exchange to the then-Soviet Union. On that trip, as a 16-year-old, he was perhaps the youngest there, while Ernst was already in college. He described her then as \u201ca mother hen who took care of everyone.\u201d He was proud of Ernst and her accomplishments. After all, he had never known a politician before they had gotten elected to anything.\n\nBut Spencer may still not ever know a U.S. senator. The race is neck-and-neck in the polls, and the Hawkeye State has supported the Democratic presidential nominee in four of the past five presidential elections. In the meantime, he was still hoping that she\u2019d pull it off. After all, he was a Republican and she was nice.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:53.764+0000"}
{"entityId": 1711, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Kentucky Republican who will likely be our next Senate majority leader has an astounding ability to lie, dissemble, and misrepresent himself to voters.\n\nAlison Lundergan Grimes has been getting a lot of grief lately, not least from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which pulled the plug on her campaign yesterday. Her team quickly sent out a press release noting that she has $4.4 million in cash on hand, which the release said was \u201cmore than any Democrat in a competitive U.S. Senate race.\u201d So she probably has enough to see her through to the end, but obviously, the DSCC move isn\u2019t exactly a vote of confidence.\n\nEven so, I\u2019d like to pay her a compliment: I can\u2019t conceive of how she managed to sit there next to Mitch McConnell at that debate Monday night and hear him say some of the things he said without her head exploding. That took admirable self-control.\n\nI\u2019m not sure which suffix to add to \u201cshame\u201d to better describe McConnell\u2019s performance: Was it \u2013less, or was it \u2013ful? Remember Mitt Romney during the first debate of 2012, how he routinely said \u201cmy position is X\u201d (invariably a more centrist posture) when for the preceding umpteen months his position had been the much more right-wing Not X? Well, McConnell made Romney look like an ironman of forthright constancy. So this is how, with a 30-year Senate record that you\u2019d think you might be able to boast about, you win reelection: By completely misrepresenting who you\u2019ve been for the last six years, and by saying \u201cObama\u201d every 45 seconds.\n\nMisrepresentations were numerous, but let\u2019s just zero in on student loans. Grimes raised the issue and noted the rising costs of the loans, which Congress hasn\u2019t addressed. McConnell responded that the Senate had taken care of the issue in a bipartisan fashion. But it didn\u2019t. The Elizabeth Warren-sponsored bill failed in the Senate by four votes, getting only 56 yeas but needing 60 to end debate and make it to the floor. Two Republicans voted with the Democrats, but McConnell wasn\u2019t one of them. And McConnell said publicly at the time that he was against Warren\u2019s plan because it was \u201cdesigned to fail\u201d since it would raise taxes on rich people.\n\nMcConnell similarly talked out of both sides of his mouth on the minimum wage, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and other issues. And he, too, dodged a question, and it was one that\u2019s rather more important than the one Grimes dodged about whether she had voted for President Obama. McConnell wouldn\u2019t say whether climate change is real and whether humans contribute to it, so if he wins, Kentuckians will have the pleasure of knowing who their senator voted for in 2012 while he spends the next six years positioning himself to the right of Exxon-Mobil (which at least supports a carbon tax) and blocking any attempt to do anything about global warming.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s real howler, of course, had to do with Obamacare. As you may know by now, he said yes, sure, keep Kynect, the state\u2019s roaringly successful health-insurance exchange set up under the health-care law. After all, it\u2019s \u201cjust a website.\u201d\n\nThis was the moment when I was wondering how Grimes\u2019s head could possibly stay in one piece. As McConnell well knows, Kynect is not just a website. It\u2019s a state health-care program that citizens happen to be able to access through a website. Kentuckians go on to the Kynect website to see what types of insurance coverage are available to them under the Kynect program, which exists solely because of Obamacare. So if you repeal Obamacare \u201croot and branch,\u201d which is still McConnell\u2019s position, you can leave the Kynect website up, but those coverage options people find via the site will no longer exist. Saying keep the website but kill the program is like saying that someone can keep that nice-looking home page that says \u201cGoogle,\u201d but it just won\u2019t perform searches anymore.\n\nSaying keep the website but kill the program is like saying that someone can keep that nice-looking home page that says \u201cGoogle,\u201d but it just won\u2019t perform searches anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing, the audacity of it. If what Grimes did on the Obama-vote question is \u201cdisqualifying,\u201d as Chuck Todd put it, then what is an incumbent senator telling a whopper like this? Given that half a million Kentuckians have signed up for insurance through Kynect, isn\u2019t this just a little more important? What\u2019s worse is that he knows he can get away with saying something like that because he is well aware that the explanation of why he\u2019s lying is a little complicated for the average voter to take in. The media just aren\u2019t set up to correct the record very well on things like this. I read a handful of write-ups of the debate from within Kentucky yesterday, and none among the few I read actually burrowed into an explanation of McConnell\u2019s lie. It just gets summarized as a \u201ctesty exchange\u201d or some such.\n\nThere was one event during this campaign season when McConnell did tell his audience the truth. But that didn\u2019t happen in Kentucky in front of voters. It happened over the summer in California, at the St. Regis Monarch Bay Resort, where rooms run upwards of $500 a night, at a gathering put together by the Koch brothers. McConnell has been saying on the trail that if he wins and the GOP takes the Senate, he\u2019ll open up the amendment process, implying that he\u2019d permit votes on issues Democrats wanted to push\u2014notably, of course, raising the minimum wage.\n\nBut behind closed doors at the Koch event, McConnell said the opposite, promising the 1 percenters that, should they win, his Republicans are \u201cnot going to be debating all these gosh darn proposals. That\u2019s all we do in the Senate is vote on things like raising the minimum wage [inaudible]\u2014cost the country 500,000 new jobs; extending unemployment\u2014that\u2019s a great message for retirees; uh, the student-loan package the other day, that\u2019s just going to make things worse, uh.\u201d\n\nThat was\u2014speaking of comparisons to Mitt Romney\u2014McConnell\u2019s 47 percent moment. The sentiment is not as clearly put, so it wasn\u2019t as usable for the opposition. But that was the probable (let\u2019s face it) future majority leader saying to his real base: Don\u2019t worry, boys, I got you covered.\n\nThat is how he will operate if he becomes majority leader.

{"entityId": 1712, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "You still think the First Amendment exists to protect individual speech? Quaint. In the Roberts era, it exists to expand corporate power.\n\n\u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The First Amendment\n\nIn recent years, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts has deliberately and dramatically expanded the power of corporations. But even more alarming is how the Roberts Court has advanced this agenda\u2014by contorting and perverting the First Amendment. Under this Court, free speech has been equated with spending, advertising, and even data grabs for marketing purposes, expansive liberties that apply not only to human beings but to corporations, because the Court says they\u2019re people, too.\n\nOriginally\u2014and up until fairly recently\u2014the First Amendment was understood to be a shield protecting individual liberty. But the Roberts Court seems increasingly intent on turning the First Amendment into a weapon against the American people, not to mention basic fairness and common sense.\n\nUpon the convening of the 1787 Federal Convention, James Madison, author of the Bill of Rights, wrote that there was no greater challenge facing the new nation than \u201cthe aggressions of interested majorities on the rights of minorities and individuals.\u201d The Bill of Rights, and especially the First Amendment, were intended to protect the powerless from the tyranny of the powerful.\n\nHistorically, we tend to think of the First Amendment as safeguarding individual liberty from any constraint or imposition by government. But notably, corporations aren\u2019t ascribed a specific side in that equation. Yet it\u2019s no mystery what the architects of the Constitution thought of big business and where they would have placed it had they had the foresight. Madison himself once wrote:\n\n\u201cBesides the danger of a direct mixture of religion and civil government, there is an evil which ought to be guarded against in the indefinite accumulation of property from the capacity of holding it in perpetuity by ecclesiastical corporations.\u201d\n\nScholars interpret Madison as warning about the risk of the Anglican Church amassing significant wealth (which was held in corporate entities) and then influencing politics through that wealth instead of its ideas.\n\nThomas Jefferson was less circumspect: \u201cI hope we shall crush\u2026 in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country.\u201d\n\nThe Founding Fathers were very clearly not only concerned with the potential tyranny of government but also the dangers of tyrannical corporations and religions. After all, consider the context in which they were operating\u2014as a new nation that had broken free from a regime simultaneously defined by an all-powerful government (the King of England), an all-powerful religion (the Anglican Church of England), and an all-powerful corporation (the East India Company). All three loomed large, and all were entangled as the United States was being created. The answer was to ensure that individual liberty was not trumped by religion or government or corporations.\n\nAll of which means that were they alive today, our Founding Fathers would likely be foraging for whatever craft supplies they could find at a Hobby Lobby store to fashion a giant, flashing \u201cS.O.S.\u201d In its Hobby Lobby ruling, the Supreme Court has extended the fiction of \u201ccorporate personhood\u201d to include \u201ccorporate religion\u201d so that corporations can use their alleged \u201creligious beliefs\u201d to circumvent laws and constrain the rights and freedoms of their employees. In this case, it\u2019s to deny female employees\u2019 access to contraceptive drugs that some Christians argue are \u201cabortifacients,\u201d even though the FDA and every major medical study factually concludes otherwise.\n\nBut as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg notes in her scathing dissent, the ruling could extend to employers who religiously object to: \u201cblood transfusions (Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses); antidepressants (Scientologists); medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin (certain Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations (Christian Scientists, among others).\u201d\n\nThomas Jefferson was less circumspect: \u201cI hope we shall crush\u2026 in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country.\u201d\n\nFor that matter, Ginsburg continues, the logic behind the ruling could ultimately allow corporations of any kind to \u201copt out of any law (saving only tax laws) they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d In fact, days after the Hobby Lobby ruling, faith groups tried to argue for special exemptions from an executive order the White House has announced will ban sexual-orientation and gender-identity discrimination for federal contractors.\n\nSuddenly, the First Amendment is transformed into a weapon, a cudgel if you will, for corporations to collude (genuinely or otherwise) with religion not only to circumvent government but to infringe on individual liberty. Today, it\u2019s just women\u2019s liberty being curtailed. Tomorrow, who knows?\n\nThe weaponization of the First Amendment in the Hobby Lobby ruling extends a dangerous trend under the Roberts Court. Consider Citizens United and McCutcheon, both of which took the notion of \u201ccorporate personhood\u201d to extremes that not only stretched the boundaries of common sense but also the clear intent of our Founding Fathers. Those rulings literally contorted a piece of our Constitution meant to preserve individual liberty in our democracy and used it to instead utterly undermine, if not destroy, the role of individuals in our political process.\n\nIn an essay for the journal Democracy about the encroaching dangers of the Roberts Court\u2019s pro-corporate constitutional interpretation, Duke Professor of Law Jedediah Purdy writes, \u201cThe Court has made the First Amendment a new anti-regulatory hammer.\u201d Purdy points to an obscure but no less worrisome ruling in Sorrell v. IMS. Pharmacies and medical data companies service drug marketers by selling them the records of doctors\u2019 prescriptions, which marketers can then use to target their sales strategies. Vermont barred the practice of selling or giving away that prescription information without the doctors\u2019 permission. But in 2011, the Roberts Court ruled that the Vermont law was unconstitutional because advertising is speech and the law burdened that \u201cspeech.\u201d Privacy and individual liberty be damned.\n\nEven the recent ruling in Harris v. Quinn, about the home health-care workers in Illinois who didn\u2019t want to pay union dues, starts to chip away at an interpretation of the First Amendment that protects freedom of association of workers in the face of corporate tyranny and instead turns the First Amendment on the workers, using it to slowly but surely dismantle the right to form a union. Moreover, embedded in the Harris decision is the insidious notion that money doesn\u2019t just equal speech but that being compelled to pay money (here in the form of union dues) is the same as compelled speech.\n\nWhere\u2019s the limit on that logic? If paying your taxes is compelled speech in support of the government, can the First Amendment be used to eviscerate taxes? And why just money? Arguably under that logic, any action could be construed as \u201cspeech.\u201d And once you go there, pretty much any government requirement to do anything could be construed as unconstitutional under this twisted but very plausible weaponized First Amendment. Make no mistake about it, this entirely plausible scenario is a libertarian paradise, exactly the sort of unconstrained freedom that big business craves.

Hardly. Reports of its demise, to paraphrase Mark Twain, have been \u201cgreatly exaggerated.\u201d\n\nStart with the idea that \u201conly\u201d thirty million people will watch it. Well, yes. Except that Meet the Press gets a little under three million viewers on a good day. Many more people will watch President Obama than Kevin Spacey playing President Underwood. Many citizens will download the speech online, too. Sure, the days when you could walk down the street and hear FDR\u2019s voice wafting out of every radio in every home are long gone. But in our multiplatform, 140-character-limit age, the president\u2019s bully pulpit still towers over others. A large part of the public craves the chance to hear our leaders talk about policy at length.\n\nThen there\u2019s the supposed novelty of a president releasing policy ideas in the weeks before the speech. Obama calls them \u201cspoilers.\u201d Not a bad idea, but not a new one, either. As Rahm Emanuel joked when we worked for Bill Clinton on his 1999 address, \u201cThe State of the Union was once a speech. Now it\u2019s a month.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t Obama a lame duck? After all, this speech comes after Republicans won control of both chambers for the first time this presidency. Here\u2019s a trivia question: When was the last time a President gave his seventh year State of the Union to a Congress that wasn\u2019t controlled by the other party? Answer: Franklin Roosevelt in 1939. Every other two termer had lost control of Congress by the last lap of his presidency. They all faced a steeper political terrain than Obama does. Dwight Eisenhower faced Cold War setbacks. Ronald Reagan spoke in 1987 right after the Iran-Contra scandal broke, and he had to lead the speech with a discussion and apology. Bill Clinton was in the middle of his Senate impeachment trial in 1999. And George W. Bush spoke at a time when we were losing in Iraq. He faced withering controversy over the \u201csurge\u201d of troops, which proved a good policy, but made for a challenging speech environment. Some of them had productive last two years; some didn\u2019t. But there is much room for a creative president and Congress to achieve things, even by fighting.\n\nAfter last year\u2019s jittery succession of crises, from Ebola to Ferguson, the public could use some reminding that things are actually getting better.\n\nFor President Obama, the new party balance offers some unexpected benefits. In recent years, Congress has been paralyzed, polarized, and entirely dysfunctional. Now conservatives control it, but at least it might actually pass legislation. Obama suddenly will be more central, more relevant than he has been in domestic politics over the past year. His veto pen will be all that stands between the Republican agenda and enactment. He can draw lines, pick fights, or choose cooperation. In so doing, too, he will have the ability to make broad public arguments in the context of a real debate\u2014on the economy, on the role of government, on contentious long-term issues such as climate change.\n\nHow can the President use this diminished but still potent platform?\n\nBegin with the much-mocked opening, when presidents all declare some version of \u201cthe State of the Union is strong.\u201d Actually, that\u2019s news. After last year\u2019s jittery succession of crises, from Ebola to Ferguson, the public could use some reminding that things are actually getting better. Last year the economy created more jobs than it had since the 1990s. President Obama has been leery, probably too leery, of a triumphalist tone. But now overall growth and a tighter labor market have begun to bolster incomes, too. The United States has weathered the financial crash far better than Europe, for example. The President is entitled to crow.\n\nThen there are the rare areas of possible bipartisan cooperation. Chief among them is criminal justice reform. The United States has five percent of the world\u2019s population, but 25 percent of its prison population. A striking consensus has formed that too much is criminalized and too many Americans are in prison. The good news is bringing sanity to criminal laws does not put safety at risk. Incarceration and crime are both dropping at the same time for the first time in 40 years. The President can point to proposals from Republican senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee, and Democratic lawmakers Cory Booker and Dick Durbin. And he can pledge to shift the ways billions of federal dollars go to states and cities on autopilot. These funds could help incentivize innovative policing programs rather than more incarceration.\n\nFinally, I hope the president will harken back to the most electrifying moment in any of his previous addresses. Five years ago, just days after the U.S. Supreme Court upended campaign finance laws in the Citizens United decision, Obama scorched the ruling. \u201cLast week,\u201d he thundered, \u201cthe Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests\u2014including foreign corporations\u2014to spend without limit in our elections.\u201d Justice Samuel Alito mouthed \u201cnot true\u201d from the front row. Who was right? Unquestionably, Obama. In key Senate races, for example, outside spending by big money groups doubled since 2010. Ken Vogel in Politico reported the top 100 donors to political committees in the 2014 election gave almost as much as 4.75 million small donors combined. And foreign firms? We don\u2019t know\u2014because so much new money is secret, so-called \u201cdark money.\u201d Of course, Sen. Mitch McConnell is Congress\u2019 most ardent foe of campaign laws, and legislative change is unlikely in the short run. But the President should use this visible platform to defend democracy and expose how it has been undermined.\n\nSo, the State of the Union address ain\u2019t what it used to be, but it remains a rare way for a president to put forward his agenda to the widest audience he will get all year. Let\u2019s hope President Obama takes full advantage.\n\nMichael Waldman is President of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.

{"entityId": 1715, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "How the DHS fight shows that the right wing is (thankfully) toothless, and that Congress is essentially leaderless.\n\nSo here\u2019s something I\u2019ve often wondered over the last few years. What exactly would happen if John Boehner bucked the right-wingers in the House? You know\u2014if he gave us one of those heroic Hollywood moments that we so long for in this sail-trimming city and gave a big speech about how he was putting principle ahead of politics and the consequences be damned.\n\nYou know what I think would happen? If, say, he followed Mitch McConnell\u2019s lead and allowed a vote on a clean DHS-funding bill? After all the dust settled\u2014nothing. Oh, the dust would fly to the heavens for a few days. Tea Partiers would scream about his betrayal. Rush Limbaugh and all the rest of them would fulminate. There\u2019d be a few breathless stories about how his speakership was in mortal peril. And then, something else would happen in the news cycle, the intoxicating effect of the drug of munity would wear off, and we\u2019d be back to exactly where we were before the dust went skyward.\n\nWe have a dysfunctional legislative system, and one of the hallmarks of a dysfunctional system\u2014indeed the main hallmark of a dysfunctional system\u2014is that no one is held accountable for anything they do. And there\u2019s no reason to think Boehner would be held accountable by his right wing.\n\nFirst of all, they don\u2019t have the votes to oust him. In his last speakership election, 25 Republicans voted against him. That\u2019s a chunk, but it\u2019s a small chunk. And besides, who are they going to replace him with? Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who seems not able to count noses and who isn\u2019t particularly well liked by his GOP colleagues? Majority Whip Steve Scalise, now branded as a white-supremacist sympathizer? One doesn\u2019t expect much of today\u2019s GOP, but I doubt very much that even this hardened assemblage would want to be led by a man with that charge hanging around his neck.\n\nSo the whole business is ridiculous. And in fact, if you look closely at the record, you see that Boehner has bucked his right wing. Although \u201cbucked\u201d isn\u2019t really the right word, since to buck means to resist with some show of strength. Boehner never does that. What he does is that he hews to the right-wing line rhetorically for as long as he possibly can, and then, when it\u2019s two minutes til midnight and it\u2019s obvious to everyone that he has to bend, he bends. He did it on the debt ceiling. He does it on budget questions. And there\u2019s always a great deal of sturm and drang, but soon enough, it\u2019s back to business.\n\nThink here about the famous Hastert Rule, that a Republican leader can\u2019t bring anything to the floor that doesn\u2019t have the support of a majority of the Republican majority. This has come up a number of times in the last four years, and always the line is: Oh my God, he can\u2019t break the Hastert Rule! Dare he break the Hastert Rule? His speakership is in grave jeopardy if he breaks the Hastert Rule! No, Lord, not the Hastert Rule!!\n\nThe right wing has not mutinied. And in fact the dark little psychological secret is that the vast majority of them have no interest whatsoever in mutiny.\n\nWell, he\u2019s broken the Hastert Rule three times. The first time was on the fiscal cliff negotiation at the beginning of 2013. On that one, 85 House Republicans voted for the compromise bill that emerged, and 151 of them voted against it. The second time was on Hurricane Sandy relief, which happened just a couple of weeks after the fiscal cliff vote. That time, 49 GOPers voted for the relief, and 179 against. And the third came a little more than a month later\u2014two years ago tomorrow, in fact\u2014when the House passed a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. That time, 87 Republicans voted aye, and 138 nay.\n\nSo look at that record. In two months\u2019 time, Boehner violated the allegedly inviolate Hastert Rule three times. And what happened to him? Well, we\u2019re still calling him Mr. Speaker, last I checked. The right wing has not mutinied. And in fact the dark little psychological secret is that the vast majority of them have no interest whatsoever in mutiny. It\u2019s far better for business for them, back in the home districts, to be able to scream betrayal and present themselves to their rabid constituents, the kind who just might go organize themselves to find a primary challenger to run against them, as the true defenders of liberty against all the sell-outs and ideological harlots they have to contend with on a daily basis, Boehner included. Gower Champion couldn\u2019t choreograph it any better.\n\nIf I\u2019m right about all this, and I am, then the question is why Boehner can\u2019t, just once, show some stones and say, at 10 or 15 minutes til midnight rather than the usual two, \u201cSorry, we\u2019re gonna do the reasonable thing here, and save this other fight for another day?\u201d Well, some have argued that it may be in this case that he doesn\u2019t actually know whether he has the votes. But I think that\u2019s a reach. He\u2019s got 245 Republicans. There are 188 Democrats, presumably all of whom would vote for a clean bill. So he\u2019d need about 30 Republicans to back a clean bill. If he can\u2019t get a mere 15 percent of his caucus to vote for a clean bill, maybe he\u2019s got no business being speaker anyway. That would mean breaking the Hastert Rule, but as we\u2019ve seen, he\u2019s paid no price for that in the past.\n\nAnd look at what happened in the Senate after McConnell decided to be reasonable. The vote was 98-2! The holdouts were Jim Inhofe and Jeff Sessions. Ted Cruz voted for the clean bill! Mike Lee! Joni Ernst and all the new red-hots. McConnell called the radicals\u2019 bluff, and they folded. I say there\u2019s every reason to think that roughly the same thing would happen in the House.\n\nIt\u2019s often said in Washington that Congress is held captive to the hard right. But that\u2019s not it. Boehner could break that hold if he wanted to. So it\u2019s not really the radicals who are to blame, but Boehner\u2019s refusal to be their leader and tell them \u201cthis is the way it is.\u201d That\u2019s the one thing, as their leader, he\u2019ll never do.

But it will show horrific, systematic, and widespread abuse.\n\nThe White House is set to give Congress on Friday the final, declassified version of the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s majority report on CIA interrogation. And according to one person who has reviewed the document and three people who were briefed on its contents, the committee\u2019s report will reveal new and shocking details about the CIA\u2019s detention, rendition, and interrogation program in the years following the 9/11 attacks. But the report will not accuse the CIA outright of \u201ctorture,\u201d an accusation that could have political, diplomatic, legal, and even criminal implications.\n\nThat stands in contrast to the blunt assessment of the CIA\u2019s practices offered by President Obama in a Friday press conference: \u201cWe tortured some folks,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe did some things that are contrary to our values.\u201d\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein has said the report shows abuse that is \u201cchilling\u201d and \u201cfar more systematic and widespread than we thought.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people will be profoundly disturbed about what will be revealed in this report,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden, a member of the committee who has been vocal in his criticism of the CIA, told The Daily Beast this week.\n\nDemonstrator Maboud Ebrahimzadeh is held down during a simulation of waterboarding outside the Justice Department in Washington. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nThe committee could release it to the public next week after giving it one final review. But as soon as the declassified version is circulating around Washington, it is sure to leak out.\n\nThe redacted, 600-page executive summary of the 6,300-page report is expected to reveal that CIA interrogators abroad misled or failed to properly inform officials, lawmakers, and even the Secretary of State about the use of harsh interrogation techniques against prisoners in CIA prisons around the world. Moreover, the document is expected to say that the use of those techniques was not effective in collecting unique intelligence or thwarting plots.\n\nThe release will also include a formal rebuttal from the CIA, which has feuded publicly with the committee over the agency\u2019s hacking of computers the investigators were using to help research this report. The document will also include a minority dissent from Republicans on the committee, who withdrew from the investigation in protest in the early stages of the process.\n\nThe CIA is taking the pending release of the report very seriously. John Brennan, the agency\u2019s director, held a special town hall meeting at headquarters Thursday in part to prepare the workforce for the report\u2019s release, according to current and former intelligence officers. Meanwhile, the agency has allowed some former senior CIA officers this week to view the report before its release to the public.\n\nBehind the scenes, a group of former senior officials who are targeted in the investigation, led by former CIA Director George Tenet, have \u201cquietly engineered a counterattack against the Senate committee\u2019s voluminous report,\u201d according to The New York Times.\n\nThey know that an entire coalition of human rights groups, anti-torture groups, and pro-transparency organizations have been preparing for this day for years, waiting for the huge tranche of information that the report will reveal to hopefully validate their contention that the CIA went too far and sacrificed too much for too little.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that [the former CIA officials] would defend their actions,\u201d Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt\u2019s human nature that they want to defend themselves, but what went on was indefensible.\u201d\n\nSeveral members of the committee this week declined to comment about the still-classified contents of the report, but said that the path forward for congressional action or even criminal follow-up would be determined by what details make it into the unclassified version of the document. The White House has been mediating the tug of war between the CIA and the committee over the redaction process.\n\n\u201cThe pro-torture crowd likely will argue that the report is inaccurate. But the Senate investigators, who had ability to look at everything\u2014emails, cables, memos, whatever\u2014concluded that CIA torture didn\u2019t produce unique intelligence and didn\u2019t stop plots.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot is going to depend on what\u2019s public. Hopefully they won\u2019t redact too much and hopefully the White House won\u2019t let them get away with redacting too much,\u201d Levin said. \u201cUntil you see what they are going to redact, it\u2019s hard to know what material you have to work with.\u201d\n\nRegardless, the CIA\u2019s defense will largely consist of attacking the credibility of the report by trying to frame it as a partisan hit job by a Democratic committee staff that failed to properly consult with top officials, an allegation vigorously disputed by the committee and its allies.\n\n\u201cI was one of the few who was given access to the report over the last few days, all of us are very disappointed,\u201d said Michael Hayden, a former CIA and NSA director under President George W. Bush. \u201cThe terms of reference of the report indicated there would be hearings, interviews and recommendations. There have been no hearings, no interviews, and the report contains no recommendations.\u201d\n\nKen Gude, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, one of the groups that actively lobbied for the report\u2019s release, called Hayden\u2019s criticism disingenuous, given evidence that the CIA went to extreme efforts to monitor and possibly impede the investigation. After all, the CIA Inspector General did conclude that CIA personnel masked their identities to snoop around in the Senate investigators\u2019 computers, removed documents from their system, and covered their tracks.\n\nThat revelation Thursday led to bipartisan congressional condemnation of Brennan, who has dismissed allegations of such wrongdoing out of hand after committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein took to the Senate floor to accuse the CIA of spying on her staff in March. Sen. Mark Udall called for Brennan\u2019s resignation over the incident.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt every step of the way, we know the CIA made this review more difficult than it needed to be,\u201d said Gude.\n\nThe next argument former CIA officials will make is that the review was unnecessary because the issue of CIA interrogation tactics had already been thoroughly litigated. Hayden declined to discuss the contents of the report because like others who read it, he had to sign an agreement promising not to discuss its contents before its release. But he did say that the rendition, detention, and interrogation program that began after 9/11 was \u201cone of the most reviewed intelligence programs in history.\u201d\n\nA detainee stands at an interior fence at the U.S. military prison for \u201cenemy combatants\u201d on October 28, 2009 at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. (John Moore/Getty)\n\nSince the program\u2019s inception, the inspector general, the Justice Department, the Eastern District of Virginia, and Assistant U.S. Attorney John Durham have conducted reviews of the CIA\u2019s harsh interrogations. Durham completed his work in the summer of 2012 and the Justice Department announced on August 30 that year that he decided to close a criminal investigation into the death of two detainees in CIA custody during the program.\n\nAt the time, Attorney General Eric Holder however made clear that Durham\u2019s investigation was only meant to determine if criminal prosecutions should be pursued against CIA officers. \u201cOur inquiry was limited to a determination of whether prosecutable offenses were committed and was not intended to, and does not resolve, broader questions regarding the propriety of the examined conduct,\u201d Holder said in an August 30, 2012 statement.\n\nHuman rights experts said the report will add value to the debate not because it seeks to resolve any specific legal issue, but because it will contain so many new details that could prove beyond any reasonable doubt that CIA interrogators used techniques so humiliating, lengthy, and painful that any common sense observer would recognize them as torture.\n\n\u201cThe report wasn\u2019t meant to be a legal document, it was meant to be a factual assessment of the documentary record. If it makes public the activities we think it will, it will leave no doubt in Americans\u2019 minds it amounts to torture,\u201d said Raha Wala, senior counsel at Human Rights First. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising to me that the committee wouldn\u2019t see its job as to make a legal determination about torture.\u201d\n\nOther officials familiar with the report say there are wide discrepancies between a report (only endorsed by Democrats on the committee) and the response to that report from both the Republicans on the committee and the CIA. On key questions like whether or not the harsh interrogation techniques produced unique intelligence that helped track down Osama bin Laden, the CIA and Republicans say it did, while the report says it did not.\n\n\u201cThese are all very complicated cases,\u201d one former senior U.S. intelligence officer told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe majority report tends to make them seem very simple, although the prose is long. The responses tend to show how complex these questions are.\u201d\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed, the man the U.S. says planned 9/11 and personally beheaded Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, was water boarded 183 times by the CIA. Former agency officials have said repeatedly that after these sessions of simulated drowning Mohammed became more cooperative, but never fully broke or stopped withholding information entirely. A 2004 CIA inspector general report said as much.\n\nHowever, Ali Soufan, a former FBI supervisory agent who worked against al Qaeda, is one of many inside the counterterrorism community who has challenged the CIA view that any actionable intelligence was gleaned from harsh interrogations. For example, he said in 2009 that the agency lied when it claimed that the waterboarding of an al Qaeda operative, Abu Zubaydah, led to the capture of Mohammed.\n\nOutside defenders of the committee will point out that all of the committee votes to establish the investigation and declassify the report had some Republican support. They will also focus on the exhaustive nature of the investigation, during which staffers reviewed over 16 million documents.\n\n\u201cThe pro-torture crowd likely will argue that the report is inaccurate. But here are the facts,\u201d reads talking points circulate among the human rights community this week. \u201cThe Senate investigators, who had ability to look at everything\u2014emails, cables, memos, whatever\u2014concluded that CIA torture didn\u2019t produce unique intelligence and didn\u2019t stop plots. That might not be a fair standard for normal intelligence programs, but torture is not normal.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have also raised concerns that the release of the report could jeopardize security at U.S. facilities overseas.

{"entityId": 1717, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Ironically, Mario Cuomo's funeral may have kept enough Democrats out of the House to allow the speaker to defeat a Republican insurgency.\n\nMario Cuomo's funeral may have saved John Boehner\u2019s political life Tuesday.\n\n\n\nBoehner managed to be re-elected Speaker of the House by a margin of 216-164 over Nancy Pelosi with 24 Republicans voting for other candidates and freshman Brian Babin of Texas voting present. The key to the Speaker\u2019s success may have been that 13 New York Democrats were out of town on the same day as the funeral of Cuomo, the former three-term governor of New York who died on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nWith fewer members of Congress voting in the race for Speaker, it meant that Boehner faced a lower threshold for a majority and could weather more defections. Normally, 434 members (minus Michael Grimm who resigned) would vote for Speaker. However, only 408 were present today. Therefore, Boehner needed just 205 votes to win. This was nine fewer than what he needed just two years ago when 426 members of the House voted.\n\nOn the eve of the vote, Republican rebels were in surprisingly high sprits, Tom Massie of Kentucky told The Daily Beast only a few minutes before the vote that they had 17 Republicans firmly committed to voting against Boehner and felt that up to 50 members of the GOP caucus to oppose the incumbent Speaker.\n\nThe anti-Boehner Republicans spread their votes out among a number of candidates, three of whom, Dan Webster, Ted Yoho, and Louie Gohmert were nominated from the floor. Of the three nominated, Webster did the best, receiving 12 votes, Gohmert and Yoho received three and two votes, respectively. However, other Republican dissenters backed a scattering of other candidates stretching from moderate Chris Gibson of upstate New York who backed Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to Curt Clawson of Florida who supported Senator Rand Paul in a vote that drew bemused giggles from both sides of the aisle.\n\n\n\nRepublicans weren\u2019t the only ones to break ranks. Four Democrats also did not vote for Pelosi as their party\u2019s nominee for Speaker as well.\n\nThe number of dissenters though is unprecedented in the modern era. Not since 1923, when nine ballots were required to elect a Speaker had so many members voted against their party\u2019s nominee for the office. It\u2019s a sign that Boehner is still facing a deeply fractured caucus in the aftermath of passing the controversial Cromnibus bill in December and may have as much difficulty with conservatives in his caucus this Congress as he did in the past four years.\n\nBoehner was helped out by the fact that several freshman Republicans who indicated that they would oppose the incumbent Speaker while running for Congress changed their minds. Typical of these members was Mark Walker from a deep red district in North Carolina who explained his vote by criticizing the alternatives.\n\n\"[W]ith respect to the other candidates for Speaker, I do not believe they possess the record of leadership and accomplishment necessary to be Speaker of the House. I cannot just vote for the most conservative candidate when considering a position that is this important to the country,\" he said.\n\n\n\nModerate Republican Scott Rigell of Virginia, who voted against Boehner, echoed Walker's reasoning in part when it came to two of the alternatives to Boehner.\n\n\"I'm just convinced there is more potential out here for us to reform this institution,\" Rigell said, adding he thought Boehner was a \"good man.\" Asked why he chose to vote for Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida, the former speaker of the Florida House, he said neither Gohmert nor Yoho \"had the temperament to be Speaker.\"\n\nWalter Jones of North Carolina, who also voted for Webster, said the Florida Republican met with a small group of members in the run up to the vote and told them \"if I can help improve the system, I will consider it.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm just grateful that we came as close as we did. We wanted to send the message [that] the American people are very upset by this leadership.\" He added, \"I have not had this many phone calls since the shutdown of the government, truthfully.\"\n\nThe rebels though seemed somewhat chastened by the result despite more than doubling the anti-Boehner votes from two years ago. Yoho told reporters after the results were announced that Boehner is \u201cthe Speaker of the House and I look forward to following his lead.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn contrast, Boehner's leadership team filed into his ceremonial office and greeted the teary newly-elected Speaker with hugs.\n\n\n\n\"That was crazy,\" Lynn Jenkins of Kansas muttered to another member as she walked to greet Boehner.\n\nAs he and his team left the room to re-enter the House Chamber, Boehner gave a thumbs-up sign to a small group of reporters waiting outside.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:55.793+0000"}

But while the return on politics to country music is welcome, should we approve of the song\u2019s message?\n\nWith liberal darlings Wendy Davis and Sandra Fluke hitting the skids on Tuesday, and \u201cGirls\u201d star Lena Dunham canceling public appearances and threatening to sue conservative outlets, it is perhaps time for another liberal savior to rise. And that\u2019s where Kacey Musgraves, who took home Song of the Year for \u201cFollow Your Arrow\u201d at the CMA\u2019s on Wednesday, comes in.\n\nThe song has been labeled controversial and progressive\u2014and has been celebrated in such outlets as Rolling Stone and Slate. And you might be surprised to hear me say that, as a music fan, there is something about it I like.\n\nSo what should a conservative-leaning culture writer say about all of this? I\u2019m torn. On one hand, I welcome the fact that country music is once again challenging us to think about one\u2019s own personal philosophy. As the Dish noted recently, country music once boasted a wide array of complex and diverse political opinions.\n\nIn recent years, however, country radio largely eschewed controversial political stances in favor of songs about trucks and drinking and booty (not that these aren\u2019t all fine American values\u2014it\u2019s just that one can only hear so many songs about them in a lifetime). It\u2019s hard to pinpoint the exact moment this occurred but, as journalist Erik Kleefeld noted, the completion of this shift coincided with the Dixie Chicks\u2019 effectively being drummed out of country radio.\n\nYounger readers might not realize it, but there was a time when country music regularly grappled with cultural issues, and when one could find a wide spectrum of opinions on the country dial. One minute, you might hear Loretta Lynn sing about \u201cThe Pill,\u201d and then the next song would be Merle Haggard lamenting about long-haired hippies burning draft cards.\n\n\u201cOnce upon a time, country was better than any other genre at doing \u2018issue\u2019 songs,\u201d music journalist Chris Willman told Alyssa Rosenberg over the summer. \u201cNow, they\u2019ve all but abandoned that, with the rare exceptions that have something to do with cancer or patriotism, and even then, I\u2019m thinking more of a few years ago than right now. I\u2019d say there are at least a couple of reasons for that. \u2018Bro-country\u2019 is so dominant right now that it\u2019s hard to put out a song that isn\u2019t about tailgating or beer or partying or booty-chasing.\u201d\n\nThese things tend to be cyclical, and\u2014aesthetically speaking\u2014I am happy that commercial country radio is beginning to once again embrace more edgy, rootsy songs. (They never really went away, of course. Americana music and \u201calt-country\u201d musicians have churned out some great stuff; it has just mostly been absent from commercial or terrestrial radio).\n\nBut while I have grown to abhor \u201cbro\u201d country, and find the reemergence of diverse political and cultural commentary a welcome return, it\u2019s hard to endorse the worldview presented here.\n\nNo, the real problem with this song is not that it promotes anything so much as that it promoteseverything.\n\nNot surprisingly, Musgraves\u2019 success has captured the attention and admiration of some folks who might not normally be country fans. Perhaps desperate for a new liberal heroine, Slate tweeted: \u201cA song about gay love and pot smoking just won country music\u2019s song of the year. Really.\u201d\n\nActually, they are misrepresenting the tune. Or, at least, it\u2019s not that simple. One could just as easily argue that this song is a defense of traditional American values like chastity and sobriety and regular church attendance, inasmuch as those alternatives are presented as equally valid.\n\nNo, the real problem with this song is not that it promotes anything so much as that it promotes everything. Or maybe that, in so doing, it promotes nothing. Now, I\u2019m sure that to young country fans living in the heartland\u2014kids who have been inundated with hideous \u201cbro country\u201d songs about drinking and riding in trucks for a decade now\u2014the notion that one should \u201cdo whatever you want\u201d and \u201cfollow your arrow\u201d might sound like an original, non-conformist, and daresay intellectual, concept. The fact that it makes your parents uncomfortable when it comes on the radio is an added bonus.\n\nBut, in fact, the message advocated here is nothing more than a twangy, catchy, and admittedly sexier, recycling of the pernicious \u201cIf it feels good do it\u201d lie that led so many of the 60s generation into the darkness.\n\nThe danger, should anyone actually follow their arrow to the logical conclusion, is not that this song promotes the wrong values, or liberal values, or conservative values\u2014and it\u2019s certainly not that it encourages to trust our own instincts, no matter what the critics say\u2014but that it presents all values as equally valid.\n\nAnyone turning to country music for life lessons or values had better be content with the advice to simply not be so judgmental! Sadly, some impressionable young listeners will internalize this \u201cadvice.\u201d And that\u2019s unfortunate.\n\nMoral relativism might sound fresh and courageous to young ears but, as a culture, it\u2019s probably one of the most gutless cop-outs we can make. If following your arrow means being true to yourself and following your core values no matter what the crowd thinks, well that\u2019s a good message. But this is the most generous interpretation, and, I suspect, the one least likely to be internalized by young fans.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:56.936+0000"}

Instead, he was violently mugged on live TV by Senator John McCain.\n\nWhatever CNN is paying Jay Carney, Barack Obama\u2019s former White House press secretary certainly earned his cash Wednesday night in his debut as the cable network\u2019s \u201csenior political commentator.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s loyalist\u2014looking tan, rested and ready in a blue blazer and open-necked shirt\u2014had only just begun to give his take on his ex-boss\u2019s prime-time speech about the savage Islamic terrorists in Iraq and Syria (spoiler alert: he liked it) when Sen. John McCain showed up on screen and performed the television equivalent of a mugging in a dark alley.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m astounded that Mr. Carney should say that the Free Syrian Army is now stronger,\u201d said the Arizona Republican, who still seemed to be reliving his anger and disappointment that Obama had beaten him so badly in the 2008 campaign. \u201cIn fact, they\u2019ve been\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said,\u201d Carney interrupted. \u201cIf I could, sir, what I said is we now know a great deal more about the opposition\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon. Jay,\u201d McCain shot back. \u201cWe knew all about them then. You guys didn\u2019t choose to know. I was there in Syria. We knew them. Come on. You guys are the ones\u2014your boss is the one that, when the entire national security team wanted to train them, he turned them down, after\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Senator,\u201d Carney returned fire, \u201cI think we have to agree to disagree on this.\u201d\n\nThe two Washington denizens--one, a 78-year-old former prisoner of war who suffered years of torture in the Hanoi Hilton, the other a 49-year-old battle-scarred veteran of Georgetown cocktail parties and the political intrigues of Time magazine\u2014kept trying to talk over each other for several riveting minutes.\n\nIn a way, the good senator saved the former White House mouthpiece from the essential dilemma of his new role: If he\u2019s too dispassionate and disinterested in his analyses of the Obama administration, he might risk burning some very monetizable bridges for which any number of large corporations would happily pay him handsomely. If he\u2019s too loyal and scripted, the viewers and even CNN\u2019s bosses might dismiss him as a flack and a hack, and decide not to renew his presumably lucrative contract (we\u2019re probably not talking Chelsea Clinton money here, but still).\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing Carney was appearing from San Francisco, while McCain was 2,438 miles away in the nation\u2019s capital. Looking far younger than his white hair would suggest, the senator was bouncing on the balls of his feet, his jaw working tensely, his eyes on fire.\n\nIndeed, McCain looked like, at any moment, he might jump through the screen, grab his adversary\u2019s scalp and start pulling savagely on Carney\u2019s recently trimmed nut-brown and amber coif, and perhaps even administer a squeeze to his throat.\n\nCarney, meanwhile, alternated between a deadpan expression of enforced calm and a sidelong glance of sour amusement.\n\nThe argument quickly got personal, with McCain stopping short of calling Carney a liar as they relitigated America\u2019s long and costly military adventure in Iraq, but it barely mattered what they were arguing about. (Later on, after McCain had departed for another post-speech television appearance, fellow panelist Jake Tapper referred to the encounter as \u201cThe McCain-Carney Showdown.\u201d)\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have the facts. You don\u2019t have the facts, Mr. Carney. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cFacts are stubborn things, Mr. Carney\u2026\u201d McCain attacked. \u201cAnd the fact that [Obama] didn\u2019t leave a residual force in Iraq, overruling all of his military advisers, is the reason why we\u2019re facing ISIS today\u2026.[It] shows me that the president really doesn\u2019t have a grasp of how serious the threat of ISIS is.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, Senator, we\u2019re going have to agree to disagree,\u201d Carney retorted, and went on to explain, with meticulous counterfeit patience, that it was the Bush White House that had set the departure date for the American military, and it was the Iraqi government that refused to agree to legal protections for U.S. troops, and so on and so forth.\n\n\u201cAgain, Mr. Carney, you are again saying facts that are patently false,\u201d McCain replied. \u201cYou, in your role as the spokesperson, bragged about the fact that the last American combat troop had left Iraq. If we had left a residual force the situation would not be what it is today, and there would not be\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator, I can posit, with great respect for you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. No, you can\u2019t, because you don\u2019t have the facts. You don\u2019t have the facts, Mr. Carney. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator, I understand that you present the facts that you believe are true based on the argument that you\u2019ve made that we should leave troops in Iraq in perpetuity, and that\u2019s just not what this president believes\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad decision,\u201d McCain spat out. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of disagreement. It\u2019s a matter of facts.\u201d\n\nAll in all, it was a veritable YouTube moment, and even if filled with more heat than light, it was a good deal more entertaining than the usual blather of punditry one experiences on these occasions. And McCain had every reason to be happy that he had put Carney (and, by extension, he doubtless hoped, Obama) on the defensive.\n\nSome minutes after Carney finished with CNN ringmaster Anderson Cooper in the 9 p.m. block, he came back on the air with Wolf Blitzer after 10 p.m., and Blitzer kept demanding to know why McCain was wrong. Carney retreated into a cloud of rhetorical dust.\n\nNext, CNN might consider pairing Carney with Ted Cruz.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:57.752+0000"}

And prosecutor Francis Schmitz has indicated he may try to appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nProgressives say the justices should have recused themselves, because they benefited from issue-advocacy ads.\n\n\u201cThe four justices whose opinion halts an investigation and possible prosecution of Walker\u2019s campaign and allies and orders records to be destroyed were the beneficiaries of at least $10 million in campaign spending by parties named in the investigation,\u201d said a statement from progressive group One Wisconsin Now issued after the decision.\n\nAs you might expect, conservatives strongly back the state\u2019s top court\u2014and are univocal in their support of the conservative justices who moved to call off the secret investigation.

His group filed an amicus brief for the side that ultimately won.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it can be the case that the mere fact that somebody has spent money on issue advocacy means that you can never hear a case in which they\u2019re involved,\u201d he said.\n\nThe John Doe investigators targeted a number of members from throughout Wisconsin conservatives\u2019 infrastructure in the state\u2014an infrastructure whose operations that has been remarkably efficient and effective.\n\n\u201cThey issued subpoenas or search warrants to virtually every conservative or libertarian 501(c)4 advocacy organization in the state,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo they were all involved, in a way, almost every one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like the guy who kills his parents and then pleads for clemency because he\u2019s an orphan,\u201d Rick Esenberg, the president of the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, said.\n\n\n\nTo assert that investigating conservative advocacy organizations means conservative justices can\u2019t rule on the case, Esenberg argues, is unfair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like the guy who kills his parents and then pleads for clemency because he\u2019s an orphan,\u201d Esenberg said. \u201cThey don\u2019t get to remove one side of the political spectrum from the bench because they\u2019ve attacked the entire advocacy structure on that side of the political spectrum.\u201d\n\nAnd investigators\u2019 use of SWAT teams and no-knock raids drew criticism from both ends of the ideological spectrum.

{"entityId": 1723, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Everyone right and left is mocking it. But the Texas governor ignored statutory procedure and acted unilaterally. Sorry, that\u2019s serious.\n\nWe finally found a political issue that unites liberals and conservatives. No, it\u2019s not something that could benefit millions of Americans like raising the minimum wage. Instead, it\u2019s the indictment of Texas Governor Rick Perry for his alleged abuse of power.\n\nWho could\u2019ve predicted that The New York Times and Brietbart.com would both label these criminal charges unjustified? Or that former Obama strategist David Axelrod would call the indictment \u201csketchy,\u201d putting him on the same side of the issue as Ted Cruz, who praised Perry as a \u201cman of integrity\u201d?\n\nNo wonder Rick Perry views the charges as a \u201cfarce.\u201d This probably explains why Perry\u2019s mug shot looks less like a defendant in a criminal case and more like a profile photo for Match.com. In fact, after the mug shot was taken this week, Perry immediately went out for ice cream, which he boasted about on Twitter.\n\nYet despite Perry\u2019s outward appearances, he surely knows these charges are dangerous. I don\u2019t care how many so-called \u201clegal pundits\u201d tell you Perry has nothing to fear. Criminal defense lawyers I spoke to who are in the legal trenches on a daily basis made it clear to me that this case could result in a conviction. And the Texas Observer, which has been following this story far before the national media, agrees.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why Perry has hired a team of high-powered lawyers to represent him, including two from Washington, D.C. And the head of Perry\u2019s legal team is nationally known attorney Tony Buzbee, who is being paid $450 an hour by the State of Texas. Perry clearly isn\u2019t putting his fate in the hands of his own version of \u201cMy Cousin Vinny.\u201d (Although a Texas version called \u201cMy Cousin Cletus\u201d would be hilarious.)\n\nBy now, you probably know what led to Perry\u2019s indictment. Travis County District Attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, who is a Democrat, was stopped by the police on suspicion of drunk driving on April 12, 2013. She was belligerent to the police and had a very high blood alcohol reading. Lehmberg ultimately pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated. Perry demanded she resign. However, when two other DA\u2019s during Perry\u2019s time as governor were convicted of drunk driving, he didn\u2019t publicly call for them to resign. Why? Well, they were both Republicans.\n\nPerry\u2019s motivation in wanting Lehmberg out could be her office\u2019s investigation into a $3 billion scandal tied to the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. Some of the people being investigated apparently have close ties to Perry.\n\nLehmberg also heads up the Public Integrity Unit that investigates government corruption. As the Texas Observer noted, \u201cpractically speaking, this anti-corruption unit is one of the few checks on the power and influence Perry has accumulated over 14 years in office.\u201d\n\n\n\nPerry, in an effort to shame Lehmberg into quitting (allowing him to then appoint a Republican DA), publicly threatened to use his line-item veto to cut the $7.5 million in funding to the integrity unit that had been approved by the state legislature. She refused. Perry vetoed the funding. The unit had to lay off staff, cut its caseload, and lacked the funds to take on statewide corruption cases.\n\nSome have dismissed the charges as nothing more than a partisan witch-hunt. Others, like The New York Times, have in essence defended Perry\u2019s actions as being run-of-the-mill political \u201chorse trading.\u201d\n\nThey are wrong. It\u2019s much more than that. That\u2019s why a Republican judge in Texas appointed a special prosecutor, Michael McCrum, to investigate. And McCrum, whose investigation led to the indictment, is no Democratic operative. He was a federal prosecutor during the George H.W. Bush administration and was even championed by two major Republicans, Senator John Cornyn and then-Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, to serve as U.S. Attorney in Texas.\n\nSo what did Perry do that landed him in hot water? He used the apparatus of the government to strip the resources of an agency charged with ferreting out fraud and government corruption to further his personal agenda of removing Lehmberg from elected office. That\u2019s undisputed. The question is, do Perry\u2019s actions constitute the crimes of abuse of official capacity or coercion of a public servant under Texas law (the coercion being the threat of a veto)?\n\nKeep in mind, Perry could have followed the statutory procedure under Texas law that provides for the removal of DA\u2019s for misconduct. But Perry didn\u2019t avail himself of this. And in fact, after Perry\u2019s veto, a petition was filed by a local lawyer to remove Lehmberg from office under this statute, but in December 2013 a Texas judge ruled against the application, noting that a single instance of intoxication does not rise to the level of \u201cofficial misconduct.\u201d\n\nPerry could have also continued to call for her to leave to rally public opinion. He didn\u2019t. Instead, he used the powers of his office to essentially strip an elected official of her powers because he had decided it was time for her to go. That\u2019s what this case is truly about, not whether the DA was a drunk or whether Perry had the power to veto funding.\n\nAdding an intriguing wrinkle to this case, as noted by the Texas media, is the question of whether Perry\u2019s motivation in wanting Lehmberg out was her office\u2019s investigation into a $3 billion scandal tied to the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. Some of the people being investigated apparently have close ties to Perry.\n\nAt this point, no one can tell you with certainty if Perry will be convicted on either count of the indictment, the most serious carrying a jail term of 5 to 99 years. And don\u2019t think that governors never do hard time\u2014in the last 20 or so years, six have gone to jail. But one thing that seems certain is that these charges are not going away soon. As Seema Iyer, a former prosecutor and current criminal defense and civil rights attorney, explained to me, \u201cIn over 90 percent of the cases where a defendant has been indicted by a grand jury, the defendant either enters a plea deal or the case is tried.\u201d\n\nBut given the reality that Perry has a real fight on his hands, why are so many liberal pundits and progressive media outlets siding with Perry? Is it their way of protecting President Obama from impeachment by saying criminal charges are baseless when an elected official is simply using his executive powers? Or do they fear looking hypocritical if they say Perry should be prosecuted for \u201cabuse of power\u201d while at same time mocking allegations from the right that Obama should be prosecuted for his alleged \u201clawless\u201d executive orders?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear. What we do know is that Perry is trying to use this indictment to his political advantage. He\u2019s playing the \u201cvictim card\u201d for all it\u2019s worth, framing the indictment as an attack upon the very freedoms that our Founding Fathers fought for. (It\u2019s just a matter of time until he claims the special prosecutor is tied to the Muslim Brotherhood or ISIS.) This probably can only help Perry, considering most polls show him lagging near the back of the pack in his quest for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\n\n\nIn fact, after Perry is arraigned today, where he\u2019s expected to enter a not-guilty plea, he\u2019s scheduled to head off to New Hampshire to press the flesh. You really can\u2019t get more ironic that an indicted governor\u2019s first stop after entering a plea in his criminal case being a state with the slogan: \u201cLive free or die.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:08:59.283+0000"}
{"entityId": 1724, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Forget about the fight in Washington\u2014the pipeline might not make economic sense anymore.\n\nWhen viewed as a political grudge match, the ongoing battle over the Keystone XL pipeline remains one of the hottest fights in Washington. Proof of that can be seen by looking at yesterday\u2019s vote in the Senate on the project, which failed to get the 60 votes needed for filibuster-proof passage.\n\nBut when considered solely on its economic merits, Keystone XL may end up being the pipeline equivalent of a jilted bride left waiting at the altar.\n\nTo be certain, that\u2019s not what environmental activists want to hear. They have made Keystone XL the poster child of their climate-change efforts. Meanwhile, Republicans are seething over the years-long delays on the project and are eager to score political points against President Obama and the Democrats by forcing them to approve the federal permits needed for the pipeline. And Republicans are already promising another vote on the project in January when they will have a majority in the Senate.\n\nCongressional Republicans can stage as many high-profile votes on Keystone XL as they like, but they can\u2019t force Calgary-based TransCanada to build it. And if you look at the challenges now facing the pipeline, the biggest hurdles aren\u2019t political, they\u2019re economic.\n\nIndeed, the pipeline\u2019s soaring costs, coupled with rapidly falling global oil prices, and soaring domestic oil supplies, may well prove more dangerous to Keystone XL than a Megabus-load of Bill McKibbens. Add in a big slug of new rail-terminal capacity that is available to move crude out of Alberta to refiners, and it becomes clear that for all of the furor over Keystone XL, the transport capacity that the pipeline might provide matters less now than it did during the Bush administration, when the project was first proposed.\n\nEarlier this month, TransCanada said that the cost of the 1,179-mile pipeline has dramatically increased since 2008. The company now estimates it will cost $8 billion, nearly 50 percent more than the $5.4 billion projected six years ago. Those higher construction costs will mean higher costs for companies who want to use the pipeline to ship their crude to market.\n\nHigher shipping costs mean additional friction for companies working in the Canadian oil sands. Since July, the benchmark price for domestic crude oil, known as West Texas Intermediate, has fallen from over $100 per barrel to less than $75. The companies operating in the Canadian oil sands have always had to sell their product at a discount to the price of West Texas Intermediate because their crude is heavier and more difficult to refine.\n\nSandy Fielden, director of energy analytics at Texas-based RBN Energy, told me that if prices continue falling, then the companies producing crude from the oil sands \u201cdon\u2019t have a profitable enterprise. And that\u2019s true if we are talking about transporting the oil to market by rail or by pipe.\u201d\n\nNor is it clear when prices might hit bottom. Thanks to the shale revolution, domestic oil production is soaring. Since 2004, US oil output has jumped by about 56 percent, the equivalent of pumping an extra 3.1 million barrels a day. To put that in perspective: that\u2019s equal to Kuwait\u2019s oil production!\n\nCongressional Republicans can stage as many high-profile votes on Keystone XL as they like, but they can\u2019t force Calgary-based TransCanada to build it.\n\nAll that new oil has to go somewhere. But US refineries are already running at capacity. As Fielden says, \u201cWe have plenty of crude.\u201d And in particular, the refineries on the US Gulf Coast, which are capable of converting the heavy crude coming out of Alberta into gasoline, jet fuel, and other refined products, are already at capacity.\n\nDespite the fall in prices, domestic oil production is likely to continue growing. In July, Ed Morse, the head of commodities research at Citigroup Global Markets, declared that the US is now producing more oil than both Russia and Saudi Arabia. The US is producing so much oil, said Morse, that the US now must begin exporting large quantities of crude, and those crude exports will come on top of the 3.5 million barrels per day of refined products that are already being exported from US refineries to customers overseas.\n\nNow to the last issue: oil by rail. By the end of this year, western Canada will have about 1.1 million barrels per day of rail-terminal capacity which can be used to ship crude to refineries across the US and Canada. Keystone XL has a design capacity of 830,000 barrels per day. Yes, it costs more to move oil by rail than it does by pipeline. And yes, there has been a regulatory crackdown on that mode of transport after a series of dramatic accidents, including the disastrous derailment and fire in the small Quebec town of Lac-M\u00e9gantic, which left 47 people dead.\n\nTougher regulations on tank cars and oil-by-rail make sense. But they are also unlikely to significantly slow the trend. Oil producers in Canada (as well as those in North Dakota) have grown accustomed to shipping their product by rail as it gives them more marketing options that those that are available with a single pipeline like Keystone XL.\n\nLet me conclude with an observation I got this morning from J. Mark Robinson, an energy consultant who spent 31 years working on infrastructure-siting issues for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Robinson, who favors the construction of Keystone XL, said the project is \u201cnot any better or worse than any other pipeline out there. The difference is that the environmentalists have successfully attached a symbolism to the project that is far greater than what it actually merits.\u201d\n\nIn other words, symbolism can work for a while. And the politics can get nasty. But in the end, Keystone XL\u2019s future depends on whether or not the pipeline will be profitable. And right now, that profitability is not certain.\n\nRobert Bryce is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

Bush paid in taxes?\n\nThen this might be the most glorious night of your life. Late this afternoon\u2014and a few minutes ahead of schedule\u2014Jeb Bush released a cache of tax returns , starting in 1981.\n\nBush\u2019s income skyrocketed after he finished his time as Florida governor in 2007. In his last year as governor, 2006, he made $261,000 . According to his newly released tax returns (2013 is the most recent year his campaign provided), the governor has made at least $29 million since leaving office and becoming a private citizen. Not too shabby.\n\nA significant chunk of the former governor\u2019s income came from high-paid consulting gigs with Lehman Brothers\u2014of 2008 recession infamy\u2014and Barclays, a multinational bank based in Britain. Bush\u2019s campaign told Bloomberg that he made $2 million a year through 2014 from his arrangement with Barclays. Bloomberg also noted that between 2007 and 2013, he made $8.1 million from giving paid speeches.\n\nBush can expect criticism for the percentage of his income that he gave to charities. Mother Jones published a story a few hours after his tax returns went online saying the governor \u201cgave little\u201d to charity\u20141.5 percent of his income between 2003 and 2013. The site noted that the national average is 3 percent and that the Obamas gave charities 15 percent of their income last year. Bush\u2019s talent as a fundraiser has had an outsize impact on his favorite charities; his site notes that he\u2019s held annual events that have raised $7.4 million toward curing cystic fibrosis. The campaign said he also raised $17 million as honorary volunteer chair for his mom\u2019s Barbara Bush Foundation Celebration of Reading.\n\nIn a post on his website , Bush touted his commitment to transparency, and\u2014naturally\u2014he didn\u2019t miss a chance to needle Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cOne fun fact I learned in this process: I have paid a higher tax rate than the Clintons even though I earned less income,\u201d he wrote.\n\nA nifty graph asserts that his average tax rate over the three decades was 34 percent, compared to Clinton\u2019s 30 percent tax rate in 2014.\n\n\u201cOne fun fact I learned in this process: I have paid a higher tax rate than the Clintons even though I earned less income,\u201d Jeb Bush wrote.\n\nFor those keeping score, that\u2019s 33 years versus one year.\n\nBut anyway, on to the transparency.\n\n\u201cToday, I\u2019m releasing 33 years of tax returns\u2014more than any presidential candidate in history,\u201d he wrote, the text resting over a colorful graph comparing his disclosure to presidential candidates of the past.\n\nIn 1988, for instance, Michael Dukakis only released returns from 5 years. For shame.\n\nBush framed his tax-return-dumping as a gesture of openness and goodwill.\n\n\u201cYou might remember a few months back, in the spirit of transparency, I posted 280,000 emails from my time as governor on JebEmails.com,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSome of them were funny, some serious, some a little embarrassing. But I put them all out because I wanted people to have a window into my leadership style and be able to see for themselves how I handled the issues facing our state.\u201d\n\nNevermind that under Florida\u2019s Sunshine Law those emails were already public record.\n\nAnyway, Bush\u2019s release of 1,150 pages of tax returns is explicitly designed to burnish his transparency credentials.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also given him a chance to ding the U.S. tax code.\n\n\u201cI just came back from Estonia where it takes residents less than five minutes to file their taxes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe tax release process sure would\u2019ve been a lot easier if we were following the Estonia model.\u201d\n\nBush also used the moment to tout his business experience.\n\nAnother graph shows that his business grew from 3 to 250 employees, and depicts that change in a chart, in case you have trouble getting your mind around the difference between those two figures.\n\nBush gave a very cursory description of the work he did between his governorship gig and presidential bid.\n\nHe mentioned, for instance, that he worked as a senior adviser to Barclays.

The top threat we need to wake up to? Al Qaeda\u2014in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Syria. And, of course, the killing of four Americans almost three years ago in Benghazi, about which the president has \u201crepeatedly misled us.\u201d\n\nDiscredited voices get just as much love from the First Amendment as creditable ones, so the Cheneys can say whatever they want. But it\u2019s worth stopping to reflect on the audacity it takes someone who left office with an approval rating below 20 percent to interject himself so aggressively into public discourse\u2014on policies whose public support is almost as low. We\u2019ve become so blas\u00e9 about this now that we hardly bother to notice. And as for Al Qaeda as our top threat\u2026c\u2019mon, Cheneys, couldn\u2019t you be even a little bit original? How about Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, which has broken treaties, invaded and dismembered its neighbor Ukraine, sustained the evil Bashar al-Assad, and cozied up to North Korea? Or China, which is busily trying to redraw the Pacific map around every rock outcropping? Or, if you want to fear-monger about ISIS in Iraq and Syria, how about at least giving them credit for being so violent that Al Qaeda kicked them out? But no; the ASA\u2019s website is all Al Qaeda all the time. When is it not, in Cheneyland?\n\nIf all this sounds familiar to you, you are right\u2014and you also pay far too much attention to the employment needs of ex-Bush administration officials. Seems like just yesterday\u20142009, in fact\u2014that Liz Cheney, along with Bill Kristol and Debra Burlingame (whose brother died on 9/11), founded Keep America Safe, which aimed to \u201cmake the case for an unapologetic approach to fighting terrorism around the world, for victory in the wars this country fights, for democracy and human rights, and for a strong American military that is needed in the dangerous world in which we live.\u201d\n\nIt may say everything we need to know about Keep America Safe\u2019s success rate that I hadn\u2019t realized until this morning that it was defunct. During the same week Cheney launched her Senate bid in Wyoming, Keep America Safe had shut down, with little fanfare, and pretty much overnight.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth stopping to reflect on the audacity it takes someone who left office with an approval rating below 20 percent to interject himself so aggressively into public discourse.\n\nLooking at the two websites together is enough to give rise to a bad case of nostalgia for pre-2012 neocon rage. The Keep America Safe website was at least a globally literate and coherent representation of international security issues. It invited readers to think about Russia, China, Latin America\u2014as well as the hardy perennial bogeymen of Guantanamo prisoners roaming your grocery stores and American Muslims threatening, well, whatever it is they threaten by exercising the same rights as the rest of us. Back in the first Obama term, when I was running a national security nonprofit myself, it was considered d\u00e9class\u00e9\u2014not to mention a tax-law violation\u2014to have your organizational mission explicitly support or oppose the policies of a major political party. Keep America Safe, though its partisan aims were clear enough, largely played by those rules.\n\nThe Alliance for a Strong America site is like a caricature of what liberals said about Keep America Safe. (An alert soul got hold for the domain allianceforastrongamerica.com and produced a more informative parody.) Really sweet father-daughter pictures and a YouTube video\u2014Liz\u2019n\u2019Dick for a new generation\u2014and fulsome biographies of the pair.

Imagine how many more Cheney vehicles we have to look forward to.) \u201cAbout the Cheneys\u201d has much more content than \u201cAbout Us.\u201d The site doesn\u2019t cover any region other than the Middle East; no Russia, no China, no NATO, no democracy and human rights. Core concepts from the 2009 manifesto have grown more florid: U.S. armed forces have gone from \u201cthe best the world has ever known\u201d to \u201cthe greatest fighting force and the greatest force for good the world has ever known.\u201d\n\nA terrific cultural studies dissertation awaits on how the fortunes of the Cheneys provide a mirror on a changing America. The cheat sheet: The declining support among Americans regardless of political party for the use of force abroad maps nicely onto the declining revenues of Keep America Safe, which IRS forms show dwindled (PDF) to just $129,000 before it was shut down. The failures of their policies\u2014and Americans\u2019 lack of desire to bring them back\u2014led to a harshening and coarsening of the dialogue, even in the formerly rarified precincts of State Department officials, as Liz Cheney once was.\n\nBut their appeals to fear and canny marketing give them a continuing place in American life, as long as they can raise money for a media booker and a website.

{"entityId": 1729, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Now that they\u2019re both in Senate leadership, Elizabeth Warren and Mark Warner should hammer out an agenda they agree on. And yes, it exists.\n\nSo this is something that starts happening in an incumbent president\u2019s sixth year, especially after an electoral walloping like the one the Democrats just absorbed: The fissures start to show. Because the president is becoming a lame duck and minds are turning naturally toward the next presidential election, the moment is now for the heavyweights in the party to start defining it in post-Obama terms. And the big fight the Democrats are starting to have, and need to have, is about how to put themselves squarely on the side of the broad middle class.\n\nOf course, to someone who sees the world the way I do, it\u2019s comically pathetic that there\u2019s even a competition here. The Republicans are the party of the 1 percent. Oh, maybe the 5 percent on a good day. But really the 1 percent. No\u2014actually really, the .01 percent. That more people can\u2019t see this is, ah, well, a whole \u2019nother column really.\n\nBut in fact I think most people do see it\u2014they just don\u2019t mind it that much anymore. This is because 1) after 30 years of trickle-down agitprop, they\u2019ve come to accept that what\u2019s good for their bosses is good for them (because most people don\u2019t know, for example, that U.S. wages haven\u2019t really grown in those 30 years while for their bosses it\u2019s been a party practically without rival in recent human history), and 2) most folks would simply rather blame poor people for their problems because doing so requires a lot less connecting of dots and is thus a more comforting narrative for them.\n\nThis is the crucial point that Democrats often don\u2019t get. Democrats and liberals are inclined to say to themselves things like \u201cif only most Americans knew X\u201d\u2014X being, say, that George Bush\u2019s or Mitt Romney\u2019s tax plan overwhelmingly benefits the rich\u2014\u201cwhy, we\u2019d have \u2019em on our side.\u201d But most Americans do know that, in their bones anyway. And they mind it, a little, but they don\u2019t mind it as much as some of what they see from the Democrats.\n\nHere, my conservative Beast colleague Lloyd Green is not entirely wrong to argue as he did Monday that a lot of middle-class people look at the two major domestic-policy matters the Democrats have placed before them\u2014the Affordable Care Act and Obama\u2019s executive order on immigration\u2014and see a party that is more interested in helping poor people, and even illegally arrived poor people, than it is in serving them.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was always a short-term political loser with respect to middle-class voters. Most of them have insurance, and only a small percentage face catastrophic illness. And you can explain why the individual mandate is a necessary leg of the three-legged stool until you\u2019re purple in the face and it won\u2019t get through to most voters. If it survives, it may start paying political dividends in a decade or so, when people have gotten used to it and it has increased the amount and type of preventive care insurance companies offer and made us a healthier society. It was the right thing to do for these and other reasons, but I don\u2019t think anyone, including Obama himself, thought it would be a big political winner in his era.\n\nDitto the immigration executive order. True, a solid majority backs the Democratic position on the substance. But the recent batch of polls shows Americans to be, what else, deeply split on whether Obama was right to do this by fiat. (I\u2019d love to know the percentage of Americans who are actually aware that the House could have spared us all this by passing the bill the Senate passed, which the country supports roughly two-to-one, at any point in the past 18 months; it\u2019s surely single digits.) So Obama is not getting pummeled on this one so far, but he\u2019s not winning it either. Again, the right thing to do, by my lights, but something that will be seen by the broader middle class as not really benefiting them.\n\nIn the coming months and up into 2016, Republicans will make sure these two programs stay front and center, because they of course know all this, and they\u2019ll want to paint the Democrats as only looking out for \u201cthose people.\u201d So the Democrats, as Chuck Schumer put it in his big speech last week, have to show the middle class that the party is firmly on its side. (I\u2019ll write another column soon about the \u201cdefend government\u201d part of Schumer\u2019s speech, which is something I\u2019ve been arguing for years.)\n\nThe problem is that the Democrats are more divided on the \u201chow\u201d of doing this than they are on any other single question. At least that\u2019s what we\u2019re told. But are they, really? So much is made of the Elizabeth Warren Wing vs. the centrists (they don\u2019t have a figurehead who can equal Warren in stature). And sure, there are differences. Trade is probably the biggest one, and the issue puts Democratic interest groups at each other\u2019s throats, although regular voters don\u2019t care much about trade policy. Whether to attack the deficit is another, but the deficit is going down, and by the way most voters don\u2019t care much about it either. Whether to give a little ground on entitlement reform is a third, and that admittedly is a big one that there is no way to finesse (except to raise the payroll tax cap, which is the most sensible approach and one the Democrats will come around to someday).\n\nThe core problem in Washington is that many both in the center and on the left are just too emotionally committed to a narrative by which the other side\u2019s prescriptions will bring about the certain apocalyptic destruction of the Democratic Party.\n\nBut on loads of economic issues, as Schumer suggested in his speech, virtually all Democrats agree\u2014minimum wage, student loans, workplace rules, infrastructure, a tighter link between productivity and wages are just a few of the things that all Democrats agree on and that, with the partial exception of the minimum wage, would benefit huge majorities of voters.\n\nI said \u201cpartial\u201d because a higher minimum wage, often thought of as helpful only to those at the very bottom, would have ripple effects for workers higher up the wage chain. In fact, this is a terrific case in point for the way in which the war between the Democrats\u2019 two economic wings can be greatly exaggerated. I have before me on my browser two recent studies on this question, one by the centrist Hamilton Project and the other by the more liberal Economic Policy Institute. Both give estimates of how many U.S. workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage.\n\nOnly about 3.3 million Americans (pdf) earn the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour or less. The Hamilton paper estimates that an increase would benefit as many as 35 million workers, while EPI puts that number at more like 28 million. In other words, the sell-out centrists have a higher number than the unreconstructed lefties! At each others\u2019 throats!\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019d like to see. Now that Warren and centrist Mark Warner are both in the Democrats\u2019 Senate leadership ranks, I think the two of them should sit down and hammer out a Warren-Warner Middle-Class Compact that consists of 10 or however many major points that they know they can get everyone from Bernie Sanders to Joe Manchin to agree on (and of course they also need to be confident that Hillary Clinton will agree to most of them). Warren makes one clearly recognizable gesture to the center, and the centrists make one recognizable gesture to the left. But they agree. They have the stature and the position and the power to do so. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re friends, but they don\u2019t seem to be enemies; Warren helped raise money for Warner this year.\n\nThe core problem in Washington is that many both in the center and on the left are just too emotionally committed to a narrative by which the other side\u2019s prescriptions will bring about the certain apocalyptic destruction of the Democratic Party. Warren and Warner have the power to change that narrative. Their chance to do so starts now.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:01.574+0000"}
{"entityId": 1730, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "By allowing initiatives on marijuana, the minimum wage, and mining to hit November\u2019s ballot, Republican legislators in Alaska may have helped Democratic Sen. Mark Begich get reelected.\n\nIf Alaska Democrat Mark Begich wins re-election to the U.S. Senate, he may have Republican state legislators to thank.\n\nBecause the Alaska Legislature failed to gavel out by its statutory deadline last week, the November ballot has morphed into an electoral blockbuster. Three initiatives that were supposed to appear in the August primary have been bumped to the general election. So now, on top of deciding whether they want reelect a Democrat in a year where Republicans could seize control of Congress, Alaskans will be voting on initiatives to increase the minimum wage, to allow the sale of marijuana, and to make it harder to build an unpopular open-pit mine near the world\u2019s largest salmon run.\n\nAny one of those initiatives could be seen as a gift to Democrats. Together, they could boost turnout by up to 5 percent, according to political scientist Caroline Tolbert.\n\n\u201cThe conditions are ripe for these ballot measure to potentially shape the races in 2014,\u201d says Tolbert, a professor at the University of Iowa.\n\nWhile Alaska is uniquely difficult to survey, the polls that have been done on those initiatives show they\u2019re popular in the state. They do especially well with younger and often more liberal voters.\n\nA February survey (PDF) from Public Policy Polling shows that 82 percent of people who identify as very liberal are comfortable with recreational marijuana, while just 21 percent of people who say they\u2019re very conservative say they\u2019re in favor it. Support from moderates hovers in the mid-60s.\n\nThe minimum wage initiative looks even more popular. That same PPP survey shows 88 percent of liberal voters support increasing the minimum wage, where 48 percent of somewhat conservative voters and 24 percent of very conservative voters also like the idea. In total, 60 percent of those surveyed said they wanted the minimum wage increased, and 33 percent did not. A poll (PDF) commissioned by Republicans legislators actually shows the minimum wage initiative doing even better, with 69 percent of respondents supporting the hike.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s going to be a spillover effect from minimum wage, or legalization of marijuana, or an environmental-type ballot measure, it should, if anything, have a positive effect on the Democrats running for office,\u201d says Tolbert.\n\nGiven that the major political prognosticators\u2014Cook, Rothenberg, Larry Sabato, etc.\u2014have all listed the Alaska Senate race as a toss-up, the extra turnout from the initiatives could make a difference.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Begich faces a tough contest. His original election was unlikely, winning only after incumbent Republican Ted Stevens was found guilty in a corruption trial only eight days before Election Day, and Alaska is a conservative state. Since statehood, its vote has gone to a Democratic presidential candidate just once\u2014and that was to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. In 2012, Mitt Romney beat Barack Obama by 14 points. While Republican voters won\u2019t pick a challenger from their three candidates until August, the national party sees it as a prime opportunity for a pickup.\n\nNone of the Senate campaigns\u2014including Begich\u2019s\u2014would comment on how they view the initiatives affecting the race.\n\nBut the initiative campaigns acknowledge that their ballot measures have the potential to shake things up.\n\n\u201cIt has the potential to, without a doubt,\u201d says Art Hackney, a political consultant working on the initiative, to deliver a blow to the proposed Pebble Mine. \u201cA lot of that has to do with the candidates as they go forward to the election. I mean I said early on that if they moved them across to the general it would certainly have a big benefit for Mark Begich.\u201d\n\nBegich is one of the few elected officials in the state to have come out against the mining project.\n\nEven though Hackney sees Democrats benefitting, he says initiatives like his should not be viewed as partisan. He can see a person supporting the anti-Pebble initiative and voting for a Republican ticket. After all, as a GOP operative he\u2019s a prime example of that.\n\nOn top of his initiative work, Hackney has a portfolio of Republican clients, including one who is hoping to defeat Begich in November.\n\n\u201cWe are involved in a super PAC trying to help [Republican Senate contender] Dan Sullivan beat Mark Begich,\u201d says Hackney. \u201cWill we do that heart and soul? Absolutely. If there is some level that Mark Begich will try to trade upon the Pebble issue, so be it.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson for the marijuana initiative is in the same camp. Like Hackney, Taylor Bickford has mostly worked to get Republicans elected. He also thinks the ballot measure he represents has crossover appeal, especially to the state\u2019s more libertarian-leaning voters.\n\n\u201cIf you were looking at it objectively, I think it would be safe to say that having the marijuana initiative on the ballot will have some impact on turnout,\u201d says Bickford. \u201cIt\u2019s just very, very hard to say how significant that\u2019ll be.\u201d\n\nOf all the initiatives, the minimum wage measure seems to be the one that most obviously benefits Democrats. President Barack Obama has made a wage hike a major part of his platform, and Begich has signed on as a co-sponsor of the legislation. National Democratic strategists have also been following the minimum wage campaigns that are underway across the country.\n\nVince Beltrami has been a major backer of the effort happening in this state. He\u2019s the president of the Alaska AFL-CIO, and his organization has put money into the initiative and helped gather signatures to get it on the ballot. He says union members will definitely be coming out to vote on it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very motivated and our membership will be very motivated to turn out,\u201d say Beltrami of the November election\n\nBeltrami points out that the Alaska minimum wage initiative was in the works a year before national Democrats seized on it as a strategy. But he says it became apparent the GOP was afraid of it this month, after a bloc of hard-line Republicans tried and failed to pass their own minimum wage bill that would have taken the initiative off the ballot. Conservative legislators who had previously voted to gut wage hikes in the past became champions of an increase that exceeded the initiative language\u2014making a ballot question moot\u2014while Democrats and labor-friendly Republicans teamed up to block it out of electioneering concerns.\n\nThe Alaska Republican Party even put out an action alert on Facebook calling on its members to pressure holdouts in the Legislature, before quickly deleting it.\n\nGiven the timing, Beltrami found the effort inherently suspect.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to be blind not to see the implications that it has on the elections,\u201d says Beltrami.\n\nOriginally, all of the initiatives were scheduled to be on the primary ballot, alongside a referendum to repeal a new law that effectively lowers taxes on oil companies. Beltrami believes the minimum wage bill was introduced because it would hurt Republicans no matter what the ballot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hot potato, right?\u201d says Beltrami. \u201cThey don\u2019t want it in August, because it competes with the [oil tax] referendum. They don\u2019t want it in November, because it competes with all the rest of the races.\u201d\n\nAnd the research backs that up.\n\nGoing back to Caroline Tolbert\u2019s studies, some of the clearest data she\u2019s gotten on ballot propositions has come from tracking minimum wage initiatives. Back in 2006, there were half a dozen that passed across the country.\n\n\u201cPeople who supported increasing the minimum wage were then more likely to vote for Democratic members of Congress,\u201d says Tolbert.\n\nBegich probably wouldn\u2019t mind if that trend continues.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:01.885+0000"}

And a group he bankrolls is paying the retreat\u2019s featured speaker\u2014George W. Bush\u2014$250,000 to wow them.\n\nMark down this weekend as one of the important early dates on the Republican primary calendar. No, it\u2019s not Iowa or New Hampshire, not yet. But it\u2019s a noteworthy day nonetheless: It\u2019s the latest round in the Adelson primary.\n\nAnd so Saturday will see at least three potential GOP presidential hopefuls\u2014Texas Senator Ted Cruz, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, and Indiana Governor Mike Pence\u2014descend on casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson\u2019s Venetian hotel-resort in Las Vegas to address the annual spring meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition, a hawkish pro-Israel group that Adelson, the GOP\u2019s top mega donor in 2012, has historically bankrolled with millions of dollars in recent election seasons.\n\nWhile Cruz, Perry, and Pence may not have the political sizzle of other White House hopefuls\u2014especially Pence, after the disastrous couple of weeks he\u2019s had\u2014they all boast the kind of credentials on Israel that makes them potentially attractive candidates to Adelson and other wealthy RJC board members. And it\u2019s clear that the RJC and its marquee donor Adelson have a strong magnetic pull for party heavyweights: Former President George W. Bush, 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, House Speaker John Boehner and other congressional leaders are slated to attend parts of the three-day weekend gathering that begins Friday.\n\nBush, who is to be the featured speaker at a Saturday dinner gala, will be well compensated, receiving a fee of about $250,000, according to two GOP sources. (A spokesman for the RJC told The Daily Beast that they do not comment on these \u201cissues.\u201d)\n\n\n\nLast year\u2019s RJC meeting at Adelson\u2019s Venetian drew potential candidates led by Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Chris Christie, and John Kasich.\n\nBut these RJC bashes are only part of a longer and intense\u2014though sometimes whimsical\u2014Adelson primary wherein candidates court the multi-billionaire while he has an opportunity to size up their policy positions, qualifications, and characters. In recent months in Las Vegas and Washington, Adelson has had several one-on-one chats or attended small events with other GOP hopefuls seeking to win his heart, mind, and big checkbook.\n\nIn February, for instance, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who also is mulling a White House run, unveiled the Foundation for American Security and Freedom to promote hawkish national-security stances and make them a high priority in the 2016 elections. Conservative sources say that Adelson wrote a seven-figure check to fund the outfit.\n\nSarah Tinsley, the director of the Bolton foundation, declined to comment on whether Adelson had made a donation. Bolton, who spoke at last year\u2019s RJC event and recently penned a New York Times op-ed calling for bombing key Iranian nuclear facilities, has been \u201caggressively raising money\u201d in recent months and \u201cfundraising is going extremely well,\u201d Tinsley said. Bolton\u2019s new group is aiming to raise more than $5 million, she added, and expects to start running digital ads and deploying other tools in the second or third quarter this year.\n\nEver since a 2010 Supreme Court ruling opened the floodgates for corporations, individuals, and unions to give unlimited sums to outside groups directly advocating for or against candidates, Adelson has emerged as the biggest GOP campaign donor. In 2012, as I reported previously, the casino baron and his Israeli-born wife, Miriam, ponied up almost $150 million for various super PACs and politically active nonprofits, including ones tied to Karl Rove and to Charles and David Koch.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that mega donors, individually and collectively, are undermining our democracy,\u201d said Daniel Kurtzer, a former ambassador to Israel.\n\nNot long after, Adelson told a Wall Street Journal reporter that he was prepared to \u201cdouble\u201d his donations in 2016, a commitment that in good measure is driven by his ardent support for Israel and close political and personal bond with conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Adelson as well has voiced vehement opposition to a Palestinian state and is considered a strong critic of the proposed nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nSome former government officials have joined watchdog groups in decrying the growing influence of Adelson and other mega donors on the political landscape. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that mega donors, individually and collectively, are undermining our democracy,\u201d said Daniel Kurtzer, a former ambassador to Israel under President George W. Bush who is now a professor of Middle East Studies at Princeton. \u201cThere has been influence by people like Sheldon Adelson, who is on the public record as articulating very hard-line, right-wing positions on Israeli-Palestinian issues.\u201d A spokesperson at Adelson\u2019s Sands Corporation declined to respond to questions for this article.\n\nAdelson is typically blunt about his views on Israeli security matters. The casino owner has called the Palestinians a \u201cmade-up nation... whose existence is to destroy Israel.\u201d And Adelson drew criticism from at least one prominent Jewish leader for reportedly remarking last fall at a Washington, D.C., conference of the Israeli American Council that \u201cI don\u2019t think the Bible says anything about democracy\u2026 Israel isn\u2019t going to be a democratic state... So what?\u201d The council, whose growing mission includes advocacy for an estimated 800,000 Israeli Americans, received $22 million during two recent years from Adelson and his wife, according to The Jewish Daily Forward.\n\nWhile wooing Adelson to tap his big checkbook has become a growing priority for Republican candidates eyeing White House runs, the 81-year-old casino baron, whose net worth Forbes puts at almost $30 billion, is holding his cards close to his vest. The CEO and chairman of the Las Vegas Sands, the world\u2019s largest casino company, Adelson has signaled through a top aide that he won\u2019t start supporting a candidate until early next year.\n\nBut the allure of Adelson\u2019s seven- and eight-figure checks seems to have spurred some White House hopefuls to go the extra mile in adopting hard-line Israel stances that jibe with the casino magnate\u2019s views. Exhibit A: Jeb Bush\u2019s rapid response to a recent speech to the liberal Israel lobby J Street by former Secretary of State James Baker III, a prominent Bush foreign policy adviser.\n\nWhen Baker criticized Netanyahu for not working harder to achieve peace in the Middle East, Bush rushed to write a staunchly pro-Likud op-ed for National Review\u2014which attacked the Obama administration\u2019s negotiating stance with Iran over a nuclear deal\u2014apparently to defuse considerable dismay voiced by Adelson and other major Jewish donors.\n\nTo vent his displeasure over the Baker speech, Adelson, among others, reportedly spoke to Mel Sembler, a close friend and fellow RJC board member, who\u2019s already raising big bucks for Bush\u2019s pre-campaign committees, according to a GOP source close to the Bush operation.\n\n\u201cEverybody was upset about it [Baker\u2019s talk],\u201d said one RJC board member with ties to Adelson, adding that \u201cJeb did what he needed to do.\u201d Other Adelson confidantes say Baker\u2019s talk has inflicted more lasting damage on Bush with some Jewish conservative donors\u2014including perhaps with the casino owner himself. \u201cMany important donors I\u2019ve spoken to who care about Israel are disenchanted with Jeb Bush because of Baker\u2019s talk and his role as an adviser,\u201d said Morton Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America, another hawkish group of which Adelson has been a principal underwriter.\n\nAdelson\u2019s fervent support for Netanyahu\u2019s policies was palpable during the recent elections when the Israeli leader won a fourth term. In 2007 Adelson financed the launch of a free daily newspaper, Israel Hayom, that now boasts the largest circulation in the country (the paper reportedly hiked its print run by almost 70 percent before the elections). \u201cAdelson\u2019s paper is known very clearly as a major political platform for Netanyahu and his policies,\u201d said Ed Djerejian, an ambassador to Israel under President Bill Clinton who previously held State Department posts under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. As Netanyahu was fighting for his political life, \u201cHayom reflected [his] focus on security and helped him get the word out,\u201d added Djerejian, the founding director of Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\nThe casino owner\u2019s influence was on display last month in Washington when he jetted into the city to take a front-row gallery seat for Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress. During Adelson\u2019s stay in the nation\u2019s capital, Cruz and a few other chosen senators who are mulling or have just announced White House runs\u2014including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida, and Rand Paul of Kentucky\u2014got private time with him or were at small events where he was a prominent figure.\n\nWhile in Washington, Adelson also co-chaired a fundraising event for Graham\u2019s political committee, which Graham is using to test the waters while he weighs jumping into the GOP race.\n\nGraham is one of Congress\u2019s most ardent backers of Israel, but he also recently endeared himself further to the casino owner by sponsoring a Senate bill to ban Internet gambling, a top priority for Adelson and one that he\u2019s bankrolling by hiring a team of high-priced lobbyists and making big campaign donations. The Graham event had another twist when former Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota made a fundraising pitch for a new conservative national-security advocacy group he co-founded with two other ex-senators (Indiana Democrat Evan Bayh and Georgia Republican Saxby Chambliss).\n\nDubbed the American Security Initiative, the group helped push for legislation that mandates congressional review of any nuclear deal with Iran, a shift that could create obstacles for the Obama administration. \u201cA few people stepped forward to support the initiative at the Graham event,\u201d Coleman said in an interview. \u201cIt was a very good place to make a presentation.\u201d Days later the fledgling outfit mounted a $500,000 ad blitz on cable television.\n\nColeman, a close Adelson ally and an RJC board member, added that he \u201cfully anticipates there will be further activities and ad buys.\u201d A GOP source said Adelson is expected to help fund the new security group, but Coleman declined to comment. Coleman added that one of two older groups he chairs, which back House GOP candidates and have pulled in about $20 million from Adelson and his wife in the last two elections, according to public documents and GOP sources, might get involved this year in promoting tougher national-security stances.\n\nAs Adelson surveys the early 2016 field Cruz is one of a few candidates to have had private meetings with the casino owner since last fall and seems to be spurring some interest, despite his weak standing with many in the GOP establishment, say some Adelson allies. But other Adelson confidantes, who are closer to the mainstream wing of the GOP, say Adelson thinks Cruz is probably a long shot because of his Tea Party brand of conservatism.\n\nAdelson, who seems far from settled on any candidate yet, has also gotten together in recent months with Walker and Rubio. Rubio boasts very strong hawkish Israel credentials and other foreign policy views that appeal to Adelson. Walker has a famously solid anti-union record that\u2019s a plus with Adelson, whose casinos have long been non-union.\n\nAdelson, whom a few GOP operatives deem mercurial at times, has indicated through aides that the bar for his financial support will be higher this time than in 2012, and that he badly wants to see the GOP win the White House. Still, the casino billionaire could be torn between his penchant for backing a candidate in the primaries very closely in sync with his hawkish views and one with the best shot at winning the nomination and the presidency.\n\nIn 2012, Adelson and his wife poured some $15 million into a super PAC that was largely responsible for sustaining a brief primary run by a longtime political ally, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, which helped delay Mitt Romney from winning the nomination. The Adelsons later chipped in $30 million to a super PAC supporting Romney, about whom the casino owner early on voiced skepticism.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:02.662+0000"}

It\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nThe white supremacist also questioned the legitimacy of Jorge Ramos after Trump threw the Univision anchor out of a press conference Tuesday in Iowa.\n\n\u201cI have not endorsed [Trump] either informally or formally, but I do endorse the conversation,\u201d Duke added. \u201cAnd I appreciate the fact that these issues are being raised.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose issues\u201d include a plan to deport all undocumented immigrants when Trump reaches the White House.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to keep Duke, who prefers to be called Dr. Duke on his website, on topic as he veers in and out of connecting the dots in a convoluted web that all leads back to the overpowering Zionist Jewish influence in media and government. It is ridiculous, he said, that he is referred to as a former Ku Klux Klan member while Nelson Mandela isn\u2019t labeled a former member of the Communist Party. But mostly Duke takes issue with everyone who is not a European American infringing on the lives of European Americans.\n\n\u201cTrump has made it very clear that he\u2019s 1,000 percent dedicated to Israel, so how much is left over for America?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a replacement of the American elite from the people who have founded America and now it\u2019s a Jewish elite,\u201d Duke said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s pretty ironic that you think about this Jewish elite and they\u2019re only 2 percent of the United States of America. There\u2019s something wrong with this picture. That\u2019s not diversity.\u201d\n\nAnd Duke is not certain that a President Trump would do anything to alleviate the situation.\n\n\u201cTrump has made it very clear that he\u2019s 1,000 percent dedicated to Israel, so how much is left over for America?\u201d Duke asked.\n\nThe candidate\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump has publicly discussed her conversion to Judaism before her marriage, and her father has been billed as the most Israel-friendly GOP candidate in this election. All this makes Trump a little too untrustworthy for Duke to come out swinging on his behalf.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason why I have not endorsed Donald Trump, because I really have to evaluate these things,\u201d Duke said. \u201cBut I really think the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are completely under the sway of the Zionists who are ultimately damaging America and damaging the world.\u201d\n\nThe one thing that gives Duke any sort of hope about Trump is his firm stance on deporting all undocumented immigrants, whose presence in the United States Duke calls an \u201cinvasion.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s enduring obviously a lot of criticism,\u201d Duke said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like the criticism I got when I ran for office, but I think he\u2019s enduring criticism because he\u2019s\u2014kind of, with this rhetoric\u2014talking about America and the traditions of America and the heritage of America. You can see the composition of so many of his rallies and who they are. They are really the European American people, the non-Jewish European American people that are waking up. And I think that the Jewish elite in America fear this.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re worried about Trump because there\u2019s this big sleeping tiger which is the mass majority of European Americans. They\u2019re afraid that they\u2019re going to start realizing that they have a common interest, just like Jews have a common interest.\u201d\n\nDuke didn\u2019t say whether he thinks the planned \u201cTrump Wall\u201d is practical, but he\u2019s waiting to see if the real estate magnate will practice what he preaches.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he will do any of these things,\u201d Duke said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s trustworthy. He\u2019s definitely a good businessman. The American people want control over our borders. They also know that immigration is a fundamental threat to the traditional values of the United States of America and the economic interests of the American people.\u201d\n\nTrump said in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday evening that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t want\u201d Duke\u2019s endorsement and that he would repudiate it \u201cif that would make you feel better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s endorsement,\u201d he said.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:02.869+0000"}

And you\u2019re stuck with the bill.\n\nBy Dave Levinthal / Center for Public Integrity\n\nGo ahead: Break election laws and violate tax rules, inviting federal fines you never pay.\n\nYou might just end up like civil-rights leader Al Sharpton, who now hosts MSNBC\u2019s PoliticsNation, a nightly news show that serves as a de facto soapbox for his liberal political views.\n\nOn the program, Sharpton regularly defends the IRS, a division of the U.S. Treasury Department, against conservatives\u2019 criticism that the agency gave special scrutiny to right-leaning nonprofit groups,\n\n\u201cThere was no conspiracy for the IRS to target conservatives. So why are some Republicans so obsessed about all of them?\u201d Sharpton shouted during a show last February.\n\nWhat Sharpton doesn\u2019t tell viewers is that his 2004 presidential committee owes the U.S. Treasury $19,500 a decade after being caught accepting illegal campaign contributions, according to federal records. It also owes the Federal Election Commission several thousand dollars in unpaid fines, even after paying off a separate $208,000 penalty in 2009 for several campaign violations.\n\nSharpton\u2019s saga, while extreme, is hardly unique.\n\nDozens of political committees together owe government agencies\u2014and therefore, taxpayers\u2014more than $1 million in outstanding penalties, back taxes, and other liabilities, a Center for Public Integrity analysis of federal records shows. Some debts are more than 15 years old.\n\nThe government\u2019s anemic campaign law-enforcement efforts and plodding debt-collections process are largely to blame for this growing cache of overdue debt, owed by Democrats and Republicans alike. Overburdened regulators spend little time chasing offenders, especially political committees that fade into insolvency and irrelevancy after violating the law.\n\nConsider the FEC: Tasked by law with fining political committees that break election laws, the agency itself has no real power to make them pay.\n\nDon\u2019t expect Sharpton to pay the government any time soon. As of late last year, his old campaign still owed a host of creditors more than $880,000.\n\nAnd the way the laws are written, the politicians themselves, including also-ran presidential candidates Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain, and Gary Bauer, aren\u2019t personally responsible for the debts their campaign committees have incurred.\n\nDebtor political committees offer various reasons\u2014no money, no staff, standing on principle against the government\u2014for not paying money federal officials say they owe. Some offer no reason at all.\n\nThe situation is \u201cdisturbing,\u201d said FEC Chairwoman Ann Ravel, a Democrat, who acknowledged the FEC can\u2019t do much about political committees that don\u2019t voluntarily pay their fines.\n\n\u201cOnly when there are real consequences is there respect for the law,\u201d Ravel said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t real consequences now.\u201d\n\nExcuses, excuses\n\nDon\u2019t expect Sharpton to pay the government any time soon.\n\nSharpton spokeswoman Jacky Johnson this week offered no timetable for payment of the lingering debts, which rank among Sharpton\u2019s numerous financial woes, both personal and political.\n\nFormer Sharpton spokeswoman Rachel Noerdlinger told the Center for Public Integrity in 2013 that Sharpton intended to address his campaign debt problems. But as of late last year, his old campaign still owed a host of creditors more than $880,000.\n\nMSNBC spokeswoman Rachel Racusen declined to comment on Sharpton\u2019s situation or the money his presidential committee owes the Treasury and FEC.\n\nGingrich, for his part, is Sharpton\u2019s debt-dodging analogue among Republicans.\n\nFederal records from October indicate Gingrich\u2019s \u201cNewt 2012\u201d presidential campaign owed the IRS $26,507 for an \u201cincome tax liability\u201d and \u201cincome tax payment\u201d as of Sept. 30.\n\nNewt 2012\u2019s IRS debt is just one of dozens that his campaign still owes to entities ranging from Comcast to Twitter to Herman Cain Solutions, a political and consulting organization run by its namesake, the former 2012 Republican presidential candidate. The debts together total more than $4.6 million; Newt 2012 raised a meager $37,822 during 2014\u2019s fourth quarter, with about half that money coming from the campaign renting the personal information of supporters to a data broker.\n\nTaylor Swindle, chief financial officer for Gingrich\u2019s media company Gingrich Productions, said this week the Newt 2012 committee has \u201cpaid off the IRS since that October filing.\u201d An updated disclosure Newt 2012 made Wednesday with the FEC indicates the committee paid off most of its IRS debts in late 2014 but still owed the tax agency $1,007 as the new year began.\n\nGingrich until last year served as co-host of CNN\u2019s now-defunct Crossfire. He remains a regular commentator for the news network and a staunch critic of the IRS in recent years, writing in 2013 that \u201cPresident Obama owes Americans an explanation as to why he looked the other way while the IRS continued its evasion and dishonesty\u201d following revelations that the agency targeted some conservative nonprofits with extra scrutiny.\n\nCNN spokespeople did not respond to numerous requests for comment.\n\nCain, in all likelihood, would welcome the $16,525 Gingrich\u2019s campaign owes him.\n\nThat\u2019s because Cain\u2019s own 2012 presidential campaign committee, Friends of Herman Cain, still owes the FEC $12,500 stemming from a fine for accepting more than $186,000 in improper campaign contributions, then not refunding them in a timely manner. The Cain committee on March 27, 2014, settled with the FEC and agreed to pay a $19,000 penalty, which is due in full two months from now.\n\nFriends of Herman Cain spokesman Mark Block, who earned minor fame during 2011 thanks to a quirky Cain campaign commercial where he smokes a cigarette, said in an email that the committee \u201cwill be in compliance\u201d with its debt-payment agreement come March.\n\nCain now hosts a syndicated, self-titled radio show that airs weekdays.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an asshole when it comes to paying people off who don\u2019t deserve to be paid,\u201d Modica said. \u201cThey took advantage of me. I\u2019m frustrated. You don\u2019t know the effort I put into telling these FEC people to knock it off, and they wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d\n\nOne of the oldest debts still on the federal government\u2019s books belongs to the 2000 presidential campaign committee of Bauer, a Republican and longtime political operative who now leads Virginia-based conservative nonprofit group American Values.\n\nBauer\u2019s campaign owes the IRS $10,454, federal records show. Bauer spokeswoman Kristi Hamrick said, \u201cThe plan is to repay that.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Bauer, like Gingrich, has been an outspoken critic of the IRS. In a 2014 message to supporters, for example, Bauer accused the IRS of \u201cleft-wing corruption.\u201d\n\nLong collection process\n\nMany political committees pay their FEC fines and IRS taxes promptly.\n\nBut those who don\u2019t should expect a protracted collection process that, in the end, doesn\u2019t amount to much.\n\nFor fines generated by the FEC, here\u2019s how the collection process works\u2014or doesn\u2019t: Once the FEC slaps a political committee with a penalty, its legal office drafts an agreement that usually demands full payment in 30 days.\n\nIf a committee doesn\u2019t pay, the FEC sends a warning letter.\n\nAfter 180 days, the FEC refers the offending committee to the Treasury and eventually transfers the unpaid fine to that agency for collection.\n\nAt that point, the FEC, which hasn\u2019t had a general counsel since mid-2013, more or less gives up on collecting on its fine, unless it chooses to sue a committee in federal court, which these days, it almost never does.\n\nTreasury\u2019s Bureau of the Fiscal Service might use any of several methods to compel debtors to pay up. They include reporting them to credit bureaus, garnishing wages, siccing private collection agencies on them, or \u201creferring debts to the Department of Justice for action.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice, however, rarely takes action against deadbeat political committees except in the most extreme circumstances. In 2013, it pursued Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. for stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from his campaign to buy high-end electronics, a Rolex watch, and the like. (Jackson\u2019s campaign committee also owes the government more than $16,000 for election-law violations.)\n\nMost FEC fines only name a political committee, not a human being, as responsible for paying, rendering threats like garnishing wages or dinging credit toothless. The FEC does not have statutory power to make a political candidate responsible for the debts of his or her political committee.\n\nThe Bureau of the Fiscal Service also lacks the resources to pursue every debt under its purview with equal vigor. It employed the equivalent of 108 full-timers during 2014 to handle all federal debt-collection efforts, according to federal budget records. IRS spokesman Bruce Friedland declined to comment. Treasury spokesman Daniel Watson said his agency\u2019s debt-collection efforts, detailed in a document on its website, speaks for itself.\n\n\u201cSome of the debts are too small for them to consider worthwhile,\u201d said Larry Noble, who served as the FEC\u2019s general counsel from 1987 to 2000. \u201cMeanwhile, meaningful enforcement for groups that don\u2019t comply [with the law] has pretty much broken down.\u201d\n\nRavel, the FEC chairwoman, said she plans to contact Treasury officials to discuss options for more aggressively collecting political committees\u2019 debts. Matthew Petersen, the FEC\u2019s Republican vice chairman, could not be reached for comment.\n\nFight the debt\n\nLeaders of some political committees say they\u2019re going to fight, or even ignore, their government debts.\n\nJulien Modica, a Democrat who unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate in Virginia in 2012, says the FEC failed to consider he was caring for his dying father in Great Britain when it fined his campaign for three election-law violations.\n\nThe FEC says Modica\u2019s committee owes nearly $27,000.\n\nModica, whose Modica for Senate committee is broke, says he will fight the FEC in federal court in a bid to clear the fines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an asshole when it comes to paying people off who don\u2019t deserve to be paid,\u201d Modica said. \u201cThey took advantage of me. I\u2019m frustrated. You don\u2019t know the effort I put into telling these FEC people to knock it off, and they wouldn\u2019t listen. It\u2019s harassment.\u201d\n\nJoseph R. John, chairman of the Combat Veterans for Congress PAC, contends former IRS nonprofit division chief Lois Lerner\u2014a scourge of many conservative activists for her staff\u2019s role in the conservative nonprofit targeting scandal\u2014is responsible for convincing the FEC in 2011 to fine his political action committee.\n\nAs far as the federal government is concerned, the California-based committee, which reported about $5,600 in available cash through Dec. 31, owes it about $8,700.\n\n\u201cWe were absolutely blameless of all charges and have not recognized or paid the illegal fine imposed because of Lois Lerner\u2019s influence,\u201d John said.\n\nDan Backer, a conservative election-law attorney who represents Combat Veterans for Congress PAC, says the committee will continue to fight the fines as long as it has recourse. A hearing on the fine is scheduled for next week in federal court.\n\nStrength and Liberty PAC, which spent $20,000 to oppose Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney during 2012, is pleading poverty for not paying $3,300 it\u2019s owed the government for more than two years after not filing campaign disclosures on time.\n\n\u201cThe committee has no money,\u201d Strength and Liberty PAC treasurer Louis Barnett said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to tell you.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the Missouri Democratic State Committee. Officials there said they aren\u2019t exactly sure why they owe $5,675 to the IRS.\n\nTheir own disclosures last year to the FEC indicate the debt is related to it receiving \u201cexcessive contributions\u201d it never disgorged. It\u2019s one of a dozen debts on the committee\u2019s books.\n\nMichael Toner, a Republican lawyer and former FEC chairman, says the government must balance holding political committees accountable with the value of investing time and resources into making small-time political actors pay them money they won\u2019t ever have.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get blood out of a turnip,\u201d Toner said.\n\nBut Rep. John Sarbanes (D-MD), who\u2019s sponsored numerous pieces of campaign-finance reform legislation, disagrees.\n\n\u201cThere ought to be aggressive enforcement because there should be consequences for going against the law regardless of who you are,\u201d Sarbanes said. \u201cFor too many committees, fines are just a cost of doing business to them.\u201d\n\nIf all else fails, there\u2019s one sure-fire way to avoid paying an FEC fine: die.\n\nThat\u2019s what 85-year-old Abe Hirschfeld did in 2005 , the year after the FEC fined his \u201cHonest Abe Hirschfeld for United States Senate\u201d committee more than $105,000 for six separate campaign finance violations.\n\nA decade later, Honest Abe still appears in no hurry to pay his penalties.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:03.758+0000"}

But this time he won\u2019t be the only reasonably sane person on the debate stage.\n\nAn eerie fog settles over the rolling farmlands of Iowa as men, women, and children file into the theater to see the show. It is the third in the series, the completion of a trilogy that began with much fanfare. The protagonist has perfectly coiffed hair and the cold, calculating relentlessness of a cyborg. His eyes bore into your skull, decipher your views, and tell you exactly what you want to hear. But this is no Terminator 3. It is Mitt Romney\u2019s third run for president. In a scene from America\u2019s similarly dystopian future\u2014in 2016 rather than 2029\u2014he has arrived in the Hawkeye State in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses to take the title role in another sequel nobody wanted.\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor has declared he will run again. Basically. He\u2019s \u201cconsidering it,\u201d the new parlance of choice for those clearly seeking the big chair. Some have noted this is probably the least severe form of equivocation you could hope for from Romney. He offered his presidential tease at a fundraiser filled with the kind of establishment conservative mega-donors who have backed his two previous tilts at the White House, who strung their flags up the mast of U.S.S. Romney as it weathered the rough surf of 2008 and the Tea Party tsunamis that followed. For a long time now, ever since John McCain\u2019s brief run as the GOP\u2019s Mr. Reasonable ended in defeat to Barack Obama, Romney has been the port in the storm. But a third movie?\n\nMaybe the crowds will come and buy their tickets simply because they always have, because they know what they\u2019re getting. It\u2019s comfortable. It\u2019s safe. Terminator 3 still made $433 million at the box office. Romney would only need three times that to finance a presidential campaign.\n\nRomney\u2019s career as a presidential candidate started\u2014the first part in his trilogy\u2014so promisingly. He was a moderate Republican governor from Massachusetts. He was a fiscal conservative who slashed budgets at the state level. He laid off public sector employees and dramatically decreased state funding to local towns and communities, attempting to overcome a budget shortfall of about $500 million without raising taxes. Unemployment fell. He passed a health care reform law, with an individual mandate as a centerpiece, that ended up covering 98.1 percent of residents. He was, briefly, for civil unions. He was for the federal assault weapons ban. He was pro-choice.\n\nAs his presidential campaign ramped up, though, things began to change. He looked a man, sure, but the influence of the machine underneath became more and more pronounced. The gears started turning, the lasers x-raying nearby brains. He seemed in a constant state of flux, in form and in political views. He was inhumanly rigid on the debate stage and at the podium but also seemed to be crafted from some sort of overly malleable plastic. Perhaps he was continually being melted down and remolded but never allowed to dry. As David Javerbaum put it with such lithe wit in 2012, Romney was quantum mechanics at work, the first \u201cquantum politician.\u201d\n\nHe was moderate and conservative. He was pro-choice and then pro-life. He was for a raise in the minimum wage, but then not right now. In January 2009, he supported the $750 billion economic stimulus package proposed by incoming President Obama. In 2012, running to unseat the president, he said it was \u201cthe biggest, most careless one-time expenditure by the federal government in history.\u201d And of course, the individual health insurance mandate was good until it was bad. There is a Wikipedia page titled \u201cPolitical positions of Mitt Romney.\u201d God bless whoever compiled that.\n\nReally, though, Romney\u2019s quantum politics are not the issue. He\u2019s changed positions a bunch, sure, but nobody really seems to care. The real problem is that, other than people who share his last name, nobody has ever been excited about a Mitt Romney presidency.\n\nObviously Democrats aren\u2019t, although Gov. Mitt Romney must once have had some appeal. He was elected in Massachusetts, and he really was a moderate before he swung one leg over the fence that kept the massing Tea Party hordes away from the real levers of power. He went from fiscal conservative and social moderate\u2014also known as being a college sophomore\u2014to the anti-Obama Etch-a-Sketch, erasing any liberal votes he might have gotten in the process.\n\nIn this third volume of the tale of Mitt Romney for President, the story is different. Romney will not be the only reasonably sane person on the debate stage.\n\nDemocrats aren\u2019t the real problem here, though. The real problem is that Republicans don\u2019t like Romney. Even the traditionalist wing, the \u201cbusiness\u201d caucus, can\u2019t get jazzed about the guy. How else do you explain the parade of clowns that took turns leading the race for the Republican nomination in 2012? Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) surged to victory in the Iowa straw poll that August. Then Texas Gov. Rick Perry had a turn before a debate performance for the ages. Then came Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich.\n\nRealistically, none of these people were receiving votes to become the presidential nominee. Each of those votes were cast for a hypothetical candidate whom we might call \u201cNot Romney.\u201d Not Romney led the polls up until Republicans from sea to shining sea were forced to admit that, yes, Mitt Romney was the best they could hope for. There would be no heroic rescue. Jeb Bush would not be riding into the Republican National Convention on horseback. The ghost of Ronald Reagan was unavailable.\n\nThis time, Bush has thrown his hat in\u2014oops, he\u2019s considering it, sorry\u2014and has already staked his claim to a significant portion of establishment Republican donor money. That\u2019s probably why Romney is telling his donors to \u201ctell [their] friends.\u201d If he could sweat, he\u2019d be sweating. In this third volume of the tale of Mitt Romney for President, the story is different. Romney will not be the only reasonably sane person on the debate stage. Chris Christie could well join him and Bush there. Scott Walker could jump into the ring. All of these people rival the Romney appeal to moderates, but are also, as far as anyone can tell, fully human entities with an ounce of charisma.\n\nThat\u2019s a welcome change, but the storyline remains unbearably repetitive. There has been a Clinton, Bush, or Romney on the ballot in every presidential election since 1988, and there is a near unassailable certainty that will continue. Romney will be back again in 2016 for another soporific chapter in his Sisyphean presidential struggle, but James Cameron won\u2019t be directing.

Marco Rubio, once viewed as a protege of presidential competitor Jeb Bush, schooled the former Florida governor Wednesday evening in the first national security address of his national campaign.\n\nAs compared to Jeb Bush, who fumbled and stumbled through his first major national security address, Marco Rubio delivered a master class on foreign policy that spoke to the soul of the right\u2019s hawkish neoconservatives.\n\nIn New York City, before the Council of Foreign Relations and their foreign policy experts, Rubio showed himself to be a peer.\n\nIn an hour before the Council, he spoke about everything from Filipino typhoon survivors to keeping South China Sea transit ways accessible\u2014and at one point corrected longtime broadcaster and forum moderator Charlie Rose about the extent to which there are Iranian fighters in Iraq.\n\nAnd he got into the details: he condemned Iranian efforts to develop a long-range ballistic missile capability, a specific gripe of hawkish Iranian experts that doesn\u2019t get much attention. He said the conditions don\u2019t exist for a two-state solution; that the VA system needs to be reformed; that he\u2019s open to Ukraine joining NATO.\n\nCompare this to Jeb Bush\u2019s first big national security speech in February, before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, where Bush mispronounced Boko Haram, misidentified Iraq, mistakenly placed the size of ISIS and couldn\u2019t remember the title of ISIS\u2019 Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nMeanwhile, Bush has spent the last few days in a quagmire: asked if he would have still invaded Iraq given the benefit of hindsight, he told Fox that he would have. Then came the backpedaling: first, the claim that he misheard the question; then, dismissing the question as merely a hypothetical. Bush got battered by this misstep, drawing criticism from potential rivals New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul.\n\n\u201cAmerica plays a part on the world stage for which there is no understudy,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nWhen Charlie Rose asked Rubio the same hypothetical that Bush had been asked, Rubio swatted it away swiftly.\n\n\u201cNot only would I not have been in favor of it, President Bush would not have been in favor of it,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nUltimately, Rubio\u2019s appeal for a foreign policy based in morality is the strategy most designed to pluck at the heartstrings of American national security hawks.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the mathematics of defense cuts that stir souls, nor the need to reauthorize Section 215 of the Patriot Act to continue the country\u2019s metadata collection program.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s the strategic belief in American morality and its link to foreign policy that drives the neoconservative movement.\n\nRubio hit all those notes: lofty words, with a measured tone\u2014citing JFK and Pope Pius the 12th.\n\n\u201cAmerica plays a part on the world stage for which there is no understudy,\u201d Rubio said. He went around the world, criticising the regimes of the so-called Islamic State, Iran, Russia, China, Syria and North Korea. \u201cMankind remains afflicted, and\u2026 its destiny still largely remains in our hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cVulnerable nations still depend on us to deter aggression from their larger neighbors,\u201d Rubio continued. \u201cOppressed peoples still turn their eyes toward our shores, wondering if we can hear their cries, wondering if we notice their afflictions.\u201d\n\nAs president, Rubio said he would \u201cadvance the rights of the vulnerable\u2014including women and the religious minorities that are so often persecuted\u2014so that the afflicted people of the world know the truth: the American people hear their cries, see their suffering and most of all, desire their freedom.\u201d\n\nAs a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, Rubio is regularly briefed\u2014often several times a week\u2014on the hot zones of conflict around the globe. Jeb Bush, as a former governor, is not afforded that level of study. The difference shows.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:04.285+0000"}

So is there any chance we\u2019ll actually clean up the system?\n\nMoney alone can't win an election. But it sure does help.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about the amount of money campaigns and political action committees are spending to win elections, take heart: You\u2019re not alone. You\u2019re part of a very, very small group of people incensed about the rise of corporate contributions and dark money in American elections. A small, frustrated, largely hopeless group of people, folks obsessed with a vitally important issue that leaves the vast majority of the country cold.\n\nAsk people if they believe elections should be controlled by corporations and a handful of wealthy individuals, and the answer is invariably \u201cno.\u201d But here\u2019s the thing: Most of them don\u2019t believe things can really change. There\u2019s a certain weary cynicism in the American electorate, a belief that the system is rigged. Of course billionaires pull the strings. That\u2019s just how it is.\n\nMaybe campaign finance reform needs rebranding. We could call it \u201cClean Politics\u201d or \u201cOpen Elections.\u201d Add a mascot (\u201cApathy Andy\u201d?) or maybe a catchy jingle, something people can relate to. Whatever it takes, we need to find a way to get voters excited about cleaning up political spending before we go full oligarchy.\n\nOtherwise, because campaign finance reform is such a dry topic, we\u2019re not likely to see the kind of sustained activism and outrage that could push lawmakers to pass a few (relatively) simple pieces of legislation that could simplify the campaign finance system, limit the impact of corporate and undisclosed donors, and\u2014I realize this is optimism, here\u2014possibly restore a modicum of faith in our political process.\n\nElection spending has grown astronomically over the last four years, from a record-breaking $4 billion in the 2010 midterm elections to that even-more-record-breaking $7 billion in the 2012 federal election. The 2014 midterms are on track to, you guessed it, break records\u2014spending to date is up three times compared to this point in the 2010 election cycle.\n\nWhatever it takes, we need to find a way to get voters excited about cleaning up political spending before we go full oligarchy.\n\nLet\u2019s put those numbers in perspective: For $7 billion, you could run the state of New Mexico for a year, send a manned mission to Mars on the cheap, buy all the electricity in Hawaii. Put the last four years of campaign spending together, and you could build Dubai\u2019s Palms Island (and maybe stop it from sinking, to boot).\n\nThese are obscene amounts of cash.\n\nYet campaigns, parties and political action committees are squandering these ever-increasing sums in a game of political one-upsmanship in which every campaign is obliged to outspend the other, and feeding the funding machine becomes a job almost as important as legislating.\n\nThis meteoric rise in campaign spending is fueled largely by a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, abetted by a devil\u2019s handshake between super political action committees and the U.S. Tax Code. The Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision (the first step on the court-driven march toward corporate personhood) removed caps on corporate spending in campaigns, causing the super PAC to become a dominant force in election spending.\n\nWhere it gets tricky is with the inclusion of 501(c)4s. That\u2019s a kind of nonprofit created under a section of the U.S. Tax Code that\u2019s allowed to spend on political causes, as opposed to 501(c)3s like your local food bank or homeless shelter. The IRS doesn\u2019t require 501(c)4s to disclose donors, and because of the IRS\u2019 reporting timeline, a new 501(c)4 (you know, the kind created as a front to drop dark money into a campaign) financial statements might not be submitted until nearly a year after an election has occured. Donors can pour money into a 501(c)4, with surety their names won\u2019t become public, and the nonprofit can donate to a super PAC. It\u2019s the perfect vehicle for wealthy donors who want to occlude their participation in the political process, and if you think this is House of Cards stuff, rest assured, it happens.\n\nHere\u2019s how Congress could start to fix things: Create a more robust public funding system to support federal elections. Limit corporate spending allowed by the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling. Require real-time disclosure of contributions. Require 501(c)4 nonprofits to disclose donors, if those contributions are supporting political campaigns or political action committees.\n\nThese are, in mechanical terms, simple fixes; politically, a nigh-impossible slog. Because, of course, the lawmakers who\u2019d have to take action are generally the beneficiaries of the system\u2014and because constituent apathy means there\u2019s no incentive to push change.\n\nLawmakers could prove their constituents wrong.

The biggest blowback will be against the \u2018reforming\u2019 Kentucky senator, because Republicans back cops, period.\n\nAfter New York City Police Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were gunned down in a retaliatory ambush on Saturday afternoon, the collateral damage was immediate.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s relationship with the police went from horrible to horrendous. Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s campaign to cleanse his race-baiting past grew more difficult, and Sen. Rand Paul\u2014who had gone out of his way to break bread with Sharpton and to criticize police militarization\u2014may now be facing an even more difficult task as he seeks the Republican presidential nomination. Indeed, for Paul, the shooting may have turned his nascent 2016 campaign into the Paul family\u2019s fourth quixotic presidential quest.\n\nEven before the shootings, New York policeman were telling the Mayor not to attend their funerals. After the shooting, the police literally turned their backs on de Blasio during a press conference. New York\u2019s Finest are feeling abandoned by City Hall. The killings will also cast a long shadow over the Democrats holding their 2016 Convention in Brooklyn (if they choose that venue) as the cops were killed just a few miles from the Barclays Center, which the Mayor has proposed as the convention site.\n\nAs for Sharpton, after leading the protests over Ferguson and the death of Eric Garner, he expressed his \u201coutrage\u201d over the deaths of Officers Ramos and Liu. Sharpton proclaimed that he had \u201cstressed at every rally and march that anyone engaged in any violence is an enemy to the pursuit of justice for Eric Garner and Michael Brown.\u201d\n\nSharpton\u2019s attempt to distance himself from the bloodshed however lacks credibility. This is the same Al Sharpton who championed Tawana Brawley\u2019s 1987 rape hoax, and who in September 1995 referred to the Jewish owner of Freddy\u2019s Fashion Mart as a \u201cwhite interloper\u201d\u2014just three months just before the shop was burned down and seven people were killed.\n\nBut in the latest postmortem to Bonfire of the Vanities, the biggest political loser may be Kentucky\u2019s junior senator. The Democrats\u2019 upstairs-downstairs coalition will absolve de Blasio and Sharpton of any wrongdoing. After all, Rachel Noerdlinger, the former chief of staff to de Blasio\u2019s wife, was a former senior Sharpton publicist whose live-in boyfriend had an \u201cextensive\u201d criminal record. However, the Republican base will be far less forgiving of Paul for his criticism of police policy and his courtship of Sharpton.\n\nFor half a century, the Republican Party has been the law and order party, and in the words of Eleanor Clift, my Daily Beast colleague, the relationship between the GOP and the police has been a love story. Looking back, in 1966, Ronald Reagan defeated incumbent California Governor Pat Brown after Brown looked weak in the face of student demonstrations and disruptions at U.C. Berkeley. Then, two years later, America elected Richard Nixon as president.\n\nNixon\u2019s victory was driven by the public\u2019s revulsion toward rioting, urban unrest, and the debacle that was the 1968 Democratic Convention. \u201cBurn Baby Burn,\u201d a cry heard in the inner city and birthed in the 1965 Watts riots, ultimately engendered fear and loathing amongst the voting classes\u2014not sympathy. Fast forward to 1988, and history again repeated itself.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush came roaring back from a 17-point deficit and defeated Mike Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor who gave weekend furloughs to convicted felons, and boasted of being a card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union. Ironically, unlike Dukakis and apparently Paul, Bill Clinton and Al Gore had each \u201cread the memo\u201d back in the day.\n\nThe Republican base will be far less forgiving of Paul for his criticism of police policy and his courtship of Sharpton.\n\nAs Arkansas\u2019s governor, Clinton presided over the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a convicted cop killer with an IQ under 70. During the 1988 Democratic presidential primary debates, Gore took Dukakis to task for being soft on crime and his furlough policy.\n\nPaul\u2019s flirtation with Sharpton is not just a matter of ignoring the past. Paul\u2019s minuet is also a matter of disregarding what Republican voters are thinking in the here and now, the here and now being December 2014. The latest NBC/Marist and Pew Polls show the Republican rank and file squarely behind the police, and rightly or wrongly embracing the proposition that police treat blacks and whites alike.\n\nNumbers speak for themselves. According to NBC/Marist Poll, 73 percent of Republicans have a great deal of confidence in the police doing a good job in enforcing the law, seven-in-10 Republicans believe that the police treat blacks and whites equally, and two-thirds disagree with President Obama\u2019s reaction to the Ferguson and New York City grand juries\u2019 decisions not to indict policemen. Pew reports that \u201cRepublicans widely support the Ferguson grand jury\u2019s decision (76 percent right vs. 12 percent wrong).\u201d\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Paul breaking bread with Sharpton may be too much for Republican primary voters to watch or stomach. Unlike Barack Obama or MSNBC, the GOP hasn\u2019t forgotten that it was Sharpton who proclaimed that Tawana had told the truth, or that Sharpton owes more than $4 million in back taxes.\n\n\n\nRight now, Paul lags behind Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush, and if Paul continues to buck the GOP over law-and-order his upside will remain limited. With the exception of New Hampshire, Paul has not demonstrated potential enthusiasm in the early primary states. He trails in Iowa and South Carolina.\n\nFurther, in the Super Tuesday states of Florida, Texas, and Virginia, Paul is operating at a decided disadvantage. Without a win in any of those three states Paul\u2019s candidacy will be doomed. For Paul, the thrill of breakfast with the Reverend, may be giving way to the taste of burnt toast.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:04.791+0000"}

If they don\u2019t, activists hope President Obama will act swiftly and decisively.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner may have enraged conservatives last week when he re-enacted GOPers whining about taking a vote on immigration reform, but his improv did little to change the assumptions among immigration activists that President Obama will act unilaterally on immigration reform if House Republicans fail to move their own legislation this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the camp that would much prefer that Congress move to pass something,\u201d said Frank Sharry, executive director of America\u2019s Voice, a pro-reform advocacy organization. \u201cI think if they don\u2019t, the president will be forced to act and I hope he acts boldly and I hope he protects a lot of people.\u201d\n\nSharry, like many in the reform community, said he believes that Boehner genuinely wants to see reform pass the House. But the ongoing clashes inside the GOP over immigration reform and other issues have left activists with falling expectations that Boehner can convince his fractured caucus to move any meaningful legislation before the 2014 elections.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t given up hope completely, but my goodness, [House Republicans] issue principles one week and seven days later they have to slam the brakes on,\u201d Sharry said. \u201cThey have such an easy time getting to \u2018no\u2019 and such a hard time getting to \u2018yes\u2019 that it\u2019s hard to be optimistic.\u201d\n\nA senior Democratic aide with direct knowledge of House negotiations said expectations are similarly low inside the Capitol. Despite positive comments from Reps. Joe Barton and Cathy McMorris Rogers on the prospects for reform late last week, the aide said that Republicans have not finished drafting legislative language for their primary reform bill, a difficult and time-consuming job. As GOP progress slowly grinds on, the aide said Democratic lawmakers are increasingly acting under the assumption that it will be Obama, not Boehner, who makes the first substantive move on immigration reform.\n\n\u201cI think for once the president might show some leadership,\u201d the aide said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThe prospects of White House action come after months of impassioned private requests, along with withering public criticism, from immigration activists who have lashed out at Obama for pursuing aggressive deportation policies while also taking a backseat to Congress on comprehensive reform legislation.\n\nIn early March, Janet Murguia, the president of the National Council of La Raza, dubbed Obama the \u201cDeporter-in-Chief\u201d in a speech to her members.\n\n\u201cWe respectfully disagree with the president on his ability to stop unnecessary deportations,\u201d Murguia said. \u201cHe can stop tearing families apart. He can stop throwing communities and businesses into chaos. He can stop turning a blind eye to the harm being done. He does have the power to stop this. Failure to act will be a shameful legacy for his presidency.\u201d\n\nA month later, Obama\u2019s new secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, announced that he would be reviewing immigration enforcement policies inside the administration, including the rate and reasons behind the nearly 2 million deportations that DHS has overseen since Obama assumed office in 2009.\n\nThe Johnson review is seen by many as a precursor to two options that the president could take to curb or even stop deportations until Congress passes immigration reform in the future.\n\n\u201cI think for once the president might show some leadership,\u201d the aide said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThe first course would see the president announce reforms to current immigration enforcement measures that critics say are so broadly written that criminal and non-criminal immigrants are often given the same priority for detainment and deportation. The result is a dragnet of expulsions for many longtime, otherwise law-abiding immigrants with dependent families still in the United States.\n\nThe second option would see the president expand upon DACA, the so-called DREAM Act executive order Obama issued in 2012 that allowed the minor children of undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States and while the parents work legally for the time being. As with the DREAMers, activists are pushing the president to halt deportations and give temporary work permits to broad groups of undocumented immigrants, possibly including the 8 million immigrants who would be eligible for legal status under the Senate-passed immigration bill, until Congress acts on immigration legislation in the future.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has urged the president to pursue both options, as have La Raza and other pro-reform groups.

Wisconsin Republican John Kline wasn\u2019t on anybody\u2019s radar in Washington as someone who might be vulnerable, or a potential pickup for the Democrats in the November election.\n\nThe choice of Kline was widely mocked by the punditocracy as less than optimal. Real Time executive producer Scott Carter explains that putting Kline in the media spotlight is a way to highlight the student debt issue. Kline chairs the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and Maher\u2019s calling him out on his conservative positions could mobilize young voters in his district and elsewhere.\n\nKline emerged from a field of 16, then made it to the Final Four, with Reps. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), and Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.), all with higher profiles than Kline, and in more high-stakes races.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t going for the biggest clown in the House,\u201d says Carter, who concedes Kline is \u201ckind of a bland individual. But we wanted to identify this issue of student debt as one the voters in his district know about and care about.\u201d More importantly, Kline\u2019s disaffected constituents mounted the winning grassroots campaign, exhibiting a level of discontent that Carter says Maher\u2019s campaign can tap into.\n\nMaher will visit the district, but he will not be donating to the campaign of former Minnesota state representative Mike Obermueller, of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (the state\u2019s Democratic Party), who is challenging Kline for the second time.\n\nUnder current campaign law it would constitute illegal coordination. Carter says he didn\u2019t even know the name of Kline\u2019s challenger when they named Kline the contest winner. \u201cGame changer for our campaign!\u201d Obermueller tweeted. As for Maher, he likes to say, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing positive about what we\u2019re doing; we\u2019re simply being negative against one member of Congress.\u201d\n\nThis is nothing like the million-dollar donation Maher made to the Obama campaign in 2012. This will be more like an air war with Maher responding week to week to developments in the campaign and any broadsides from Kline, and citing more reasons why he shouldn\u2019t be returned to Congress. The race should give Maher fresh material for his fall season of Friday night Real Time shows.\n\nEasily reelected in 2012 to his sixth term in the House, Kline has never received less than 54 percent of the vote, a landslide in these partisan times. He is, like so many of the 435 members of the House, coasting to reelection while taking positions that many in his district may not agree with but feel powerless to change, and as a consequence often don\u2019t bother to vote. That is especially true of young people, Maher\u2019s target audience in his campaign to oust Kline.\n\n\u201cWe thought we could make the bigger statement about Kline,\u201d says Carter. Instead of highlighting other lawmakers who have made clownish statements, Maher chose someone who would otherwise get no attention, but who wields considerable power around the issues that touch young voters most\u2014student loan debt, and climate change.\n\nIn a statement that first appeared on Medialite, a Kline spokesman ticked off Maher\u2019s history of controversial statements and said Obermueller \u201cpromotes this behavior essentially naming Maher as his campaign manager.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t going for the biggest clown in the House...But we wanted to identify this issue of student debt as one the voters in his district know about and care about.\u201d\n\nIn announcing Kline as the winner, Maher called him \u201cthe living embodiment of legislators for hire, the Men\u2019s Warehouse of empty suits.\u201d Realizing that few people had ever heard of Kline, Maher added that those thinking he might be Jewish are wrong, then pointed out that might have made him more interesting.\n\nTruth is, Kline\u2019s blandness is what made him so appealing as a representative of dysfunctional government. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those silent threats you never see coming,\u201d Maher said. \u201cEbola, Isis, John Kline\u2026One of the whores and sellouts that keep this town running.\u201d\n\nMaher\u2019s language is brutal, and funny, and all too true as he takes aim at Kline\u2019s exalted position of chairman of the education committee, declaring he \u201chas done more to keep twentysomethings in their parents\u2019 basements than anyone else alive.\u201d He calls Kline the champion of for-profit colleges, which have a dropout rate \u201cworse than celebrity rehab.\u201d They\u2019re not real colleges, Maher says: \u201cThey\u2019re scams because John Kline is bought and paid for by the very people he is pretending to regulate.\u201d\n\nLike most of his Republican colleagues, Kline voted 54 times to repeal Obamacare, he\u2019s against raising the minimum wage, he\u2019s against stem-cell research, against Planned Parenthood\u2014\u201cand he voted to deny funds to even study climate change,\u201d Maher said on his show. This is serious stuff if you\u2019re a Democrat, and if you\u2019re not, they\u2019re fighting words. Maher makes his living making fun of politics so whatever happens, it will be entertaining. Obermueller is not considered a serious challenger. Kline easily defeated him two years ago, winning by eight points.

{"entityId": 1742, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Show Obama a market problem, and he has one solution: subsidize its purchase. Wrong! The right answer: increase supply instead.\n\nIf you want to get a sense of why Barack Obama alienates not just libertarians but large and growing swaths of basically apolitical Americans, consider how he treated day care in Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union Address (SOTU).\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that he even talked about the issue in the first place. As the father of two kids whose mother has always worked, I know how difficult, frustrating, and anxiety-inducing it is to find good, affordable day care. But come on already, this issue just doesn\u2019t rate as a national concern to be dealt with in \u201cthe only speech a modern president can expect all of the networks to cover.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s not just that he talked about an issue as small-ball as day care, it\u2019s how he talked about it that helps explain why so many have soured on the guy (indeed, his SOTU ratings over the years have tanked, with Tuesday\u2019s speech the worst yet). For all his yammering about how \u201ctonight, we turn the page\u201d and that we need to be \u201clooking to the future instead of the past,\u201d Obama is stuck in the dreariest, 20th-century liberal mindset when it comes to problem solving.\n\nAfter falsely claiming that the federal government provided \u201cuniversal childcare\u201d during World War II (in fact, the feds provided child care for a peak of 130,000 kids in 1944, Obama laid out his grand plan for fixing this problem: Give \u201cworking Americans\u201d tax cuts and subsidies to buy child care. In fact, that\u2019s pretty much his answer to everything, whether we\u2019re talking college (whose cost he pledged to \u201clower...to zero\u201d), health care (Obamacare is built around subsidies for insurance premiums), or home ownership (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are back to requiring just 3 percent down on home loans).\n\nThe one thing you\u2019ll never hear Obama talk about is increasing the supply of just about anything. But that\u2019s precisely how prices really come down and increasingly higher-quality goods and services become affordable and ubiquitous. We didn\u2019t get to cheap hamburgers by subsidizing their purchase through targeted tax breaks to working Americans. Fast-food chains drove down prices and upped quality in their desperate attempts to grab and keep customers.\n\nThe same thing is true of all sorts of consumer products and services. When VCRs, home computers, and cell phones first hit the markets, only wealthy people could afford them. Prices tumbled because manufacturers increased the supply and variety, not because the government gave us money to go purchase them. As the economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote in 1942\u2019s Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, \u201cThe capitalist achievement does not typically consist in providing more silk stockings for queens [but] in bringing [silk stockings] within the reach of factory girls.\u201d\n\nThat same dynamic holds true for day care and health care too. Yet Obamacare does essentially nothing to grow the supply of health care, just as the president has shown no interest in growing the supply of day care. Why not work to get rid of the sorts of occupational licensing rules and other regulations in both areas that rarely accomplish any goals other than driving up prices and keeping incumbents happy?\n\nThe Obama administration is instead throwing up more obstacles to day care options by requiring providers in federal programs to have college degrees. That\u2019s even though there\u2019s no evidence that such a requirement has any effect on the quality of care. Similarly useless constraints on the possible supply of health care exist. \u201cCertificate of need\u201d laws, which essentially let existing health care providers veto new entrants into the marketplace, are just one example.\n\nIn the 1950s, just 5 percent of jobs required occupational licensing of some sort. Today, says the liberal Progressive Policy Institute, the figure is closer to one-third. \u201cMany worry,\u201d writes Dane Stangler, \u201cthat this growth, while salutary to a point, has now become a structural rigidity and a drag on economic vitality.\u201d Think about Uber in this context, which has radically increased transportation options for many urban Americans in spite of local government regulations. When supply increases, prices come down.\n\nIn the 1950s, just 5 percent of jobs required occupational licensing of some sort. Today the figure is closer to one-third.\n\nIf Obama was really interested in looking to the future and shaking off the past\u2014not to mention jumpstarting economic innovation and growth\u2014he\u2019d do well to think about growing the supply of goods and services rather than trying always to manage the demand side. Not only would that be smarter, it would be easier, too, because it doesn\u2019t involve trying to figure out how many widgets, day care slots, or hip operations people will want in 10 or 20 years.\n\nSupply doesn\u2019t always create its own demand, but we really have little idea as to what goods, services, and technologies are going to emerge and stick around (do you still have a VCR, or even a DVD player?). Which makes it hard as hell to plan to subsidize demand via government programs. It's far better to reduce barriers to innovation and entrepreneurship than to use slow-moving, lumbering subsidy programs to move into the 21st century.\n\nWho knows? Articulating such future-oriented policies might even mean that more people would tune into Obama\u2019s final State of the Union Address in a year\u2019s time.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:08.294+0000"}

Well, it happened.\n\nBut this was just the beginning of the weird parental follies of Florida in the early 2000s.\n\nIn 2001, Bush didn\u2019t veto adoption-overhaul legislation that included a provision making it harder for unwed mothers to put their children up for adoption, as The Huffington Post recently reported .\n\nAnd by taking a pass, he allowed a particularly offensive provision to become law.\n\nThis provision required any woman who wanted to put her child up for adoption, but who didn\u2019t know who the father was, to take out an ad in a local newspaper listing her name and description, as well as the name and description of each possible father and the locations where the baby could have been conceived.\n\nIn other words, women had to broadcast her sexual histories to, well, pretty much everybody before attempting to find stable homes for her children.\n\nThe law\u2019s sponsor, state Senator Walter Campbell, said the provision was designed to keep \u201cpotential biological fathers from coming back and taking children out of adoptive parents\u2019 hands.\u201d And the law didn\u2019t include an exception for women who became pregnant because of rape.\n\n\u201cYou cannot just allow someone to say they were raped and use that as an excuse not to provide a name,\u201d said Deborah Marks , who helped draft the law, at the time.\n\nAlvin Coen, a veteran adoption lawyer, told the New Pittsburgh Courier at the time that concerns about birth fathers interfering with adoptions were baseless.\n\nThe bill passed overwhelmingly in the state House and by a 30-8 vote in the state Senate. Bush said he decided not to veto it because Campbell told him the newspaper-reporting language would get fixed. That didn\u2019t happen. What did happen? More abortions. The Orlando Sentinel reported there were almost 2,000 more abortions in the first six months of 2002\u2014after the legislation went into effect\u2014than in the first six months of 2001.\n\nAfter state courts declared the law unconstitutional, Bush signed legislation repealing it.

Far away from where they come, further away from where they go,\u201d singer Eddie Ganz croons in Spanish over the Caribbean beat of the marimba, a wooden xylophone-like instrument from Guatemala. \u201cThey call her the Beast from the South, this wretched train of death. With the devil in the boiler, whistles, roars, twists and turns.\u201d\n\nPeople throughout Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador call their local radio stations to request this song, a harrowing tale of violence and death set against the backdrop of Central America\u2019s traditionally upbeat cumbia music. \u201cLa Bestia,\u201d or \u201cThe Beast\u201d refers to the notoriously dangerous freight train upon which thousands of migrants ride from Southern Mexico, risking robbery, kidnapping, rape, and murder just to make it to the U.S. border. It\u2019s a familiar tale told by an expected source. In fact, the popularity of \u201cLa Bestia\u201d owes itself in large part to the fact that its audience is not aware of its origins. The song, and others like it, are part of a U.S. Customs and Border Protection campaign to deter illegal immigration to the United States.\n\nLast week, CBP announced plans to launch a new, million-dollar \u201cDangers Awareness Campaign,\u201d aimed at discouraging families in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador from sending their children with smugglers to cross the U.S. border through Mexico. A press release described billboards and public service announcements to be aired on television and radio in those three countries as well as U.S. cities with large Central American populations. Not highlighted was \u201cLa Bestia,\u201d the song written and produced for the sole purpose of spreading CBP\u2019s message through music.\n\n\u201cLa Bestia\u201d is not the first song commissioned by CBP, but it is the only one written specifically for a Central American audience. In 2004, CBP launched it\u2019s first messaging campaign in Mexico called \u201cNo Mas Cruces,\u201d which intentionally can be translated as both \u201cNo More Crossings\u201d or \u201cNo More Crosses,\u201d as in crosses on graves. The objective of \u201cNo Mas Cruces,\u201d was to spread awareness about the dangers of the Sonoran desert, where hundreds of migrants die every year. Part of that campaign included distributing a CD of five songs about the risks involved in crossing the border to radio stations throughout Mexico. The songs, called \u201cmigra corridos,\u201d a play on the popular narcocorridos or gangster ballads after which they were modeled, became hugely popular with listeners. \u201cLa Bestia\u201d is currently played by 21 radio stations throughout Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.\n\nD.C.-based advertising agency Elevation worked with CBP on \u201cNo Mas Cruces\u201d as well as the \u201cDangers\u201d campaign, and creative director Rodolfo Hernandez is the man behind the songs.\n\nHernandez, originally from Mexico, channeled his background writing Spanish poetry and short stories to write the lyrics for \u201cLa Bestia\u201d and the other corridos. He then enlisted the help of New York City musician Carlo Nicolau to compose the music. Professional jingle /voice-over artist Eddie Ganz provided the vocals. And, voila! Propaganda is made.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection would prefer the term \u201chumanitarian campaign.\u201d And, to Elevation\u2019s credit, the songs are clearly focused on the very real and all too common risks involved in illegal immigration. \u201cLa Bestia,\u201d references Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, one of the violent gangs involved in human smuggling and whose members stalk the infamous train, preying on any migrants who dare ride it. \u201cEl Mas Grande Enemigo,\u201d a corrido Hernandez wrote for Mexican audiences, starts with two cousins setting out to cross the border together and ends with one of them dead in the desert.\n\nWhat makes the music seem a bit manipulative is the fact that the songs are played as part of the radio stations\u2019 regular rotation, with no disclaimer about who's sponsoring them. Elevation sends radio stations two versions of the songs: one, complete, three to four minute version. Another one less than a minute long with a brief PSA at the end. Neither mentions Border Patrol or the U.S. government\u2014and that\u2019s intentional. CBP knows that attaching it\u2019s name to the campaign would immediately decrease its effectiveness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more important to us that the message be delivered,\u201d Laurel Smith, director of communications and outreach for CBP told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe want to make sure the audience is listening.\u201d\n\nAnd they are. In a 2009 Associated Press article about migra corridos, then-Border Patrol spokesperson Wendi Lee credited the songs with contributing to the drop in crossing deaths, from 492 in 2005 to 390 in 2008. The article also quoted the manager of one Mexican radio station who said his listeners loved the corridos because they could all relate to the stories in one way or another, but if they had any idea about CBP\u2019s involvement the reaction would be drastically different.\n\nComposer Carlo Nicolau understands. Born in the United States to Mexican parents, Nicolau has heard his fair share of horror stories from friends and relatives about migrants treated poorly by Border Patrol. So when he was first approached to create music for the Border Patrol, he was hesitant.\n\n\u201cI thought I was really going to bed with the devil,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d heard from many people that some of these Border Patrol agents are pretty shrewd. But I\u2019ve learned that a lot of them are risking their lives to help people not die.\u201d\n\nNicolau said he\u2019d love to be involved in creating more songs for the Border Patrol, but in the meantime he\u2019s confident that the music he composed for \u201cLa Bestia\u201d and the others is timeless enough to remain relevant for years to come.\n\n\u201cI really think that putting music to this message makes it very powerful, because people listen to the radio in their towns and their villages,\u201d he said. \u201cThe songs don\u2019t accuse anyone of wrongdoing, there are no heroes or villains in these stories. They are just letting people know that their lives are in danger.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:08.960+0000"}

Enter Adam Nagourney, The New York Times\u2019 longtime political chieftain turned chronicler of the West, from fault lines in California to the renaissance of the Vietnam-blighted but domestically transformative legacy of Lyndon Johnson.

Republicans such as Rand Paul and Ted Cruz pulled back from Bundy if not from his peculiar version of nullification\u2014his fevered attempt to disclaim the validity of federal law. It was predictable; sometimes loyalty to the Tea Party asks too much. But the episode raised, or should have raised, another question: As senators, didn\u2019t these guys take an oath to \u201cdefend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign or domestic\u201d?\n\nThe press could have spent news cycle after news cycle focusing on the tendency of too many Republicans to fellow-travel with extremists such as Bundy if Sterling hadn\u2019t burst into the headlines. Here was the owner of the NBA\u2019s Los Angeles Clippers, on the phone to his girlfriend, dribbling out foul-mouthed bile insulting to his own players and the legendary Magic Johnson. As long as Sterling was the team\u2019s owner, Johnson soon said, he would never attend another Clippers game.\n\nWell, that didn\u2019t take long: The NBA fined Sterling\u2014although the maximum permitted under the rules, $2.5 million, is a rounding error for him\u2014and banned him from the league not for a year, but for life. Commissioner Adam Silver pledged to \u201cdo everything in my power\u201d to force Sterling to sell the team\u2014with which he can now have no contact. Thus we will be spared the endless court-side spectacle of a latter-day purveyor of prejudice presiding over his own private plantation.\n\nIndeed Sterling\u2019s fitness to own a franchise in the NBA, where the players are predominantly African-American, should have been forfeit since 2006, when he forked over $2.7 million\u2014the largest settlement of its kind in history\u2014in a federal suit alleging discrimination across his vast swath of rental apartments. \u201cBlack tenants,\u201d he had said, \u201csmell and attract vermin.\u201d\n\nThe first black president called out Sterling\u2019s latest screed for what it was\u2014\u201cincredibly offensive, racist ignorance.\u201d The Clippers themselves played on, but protested with pre-game reverse jerseys and black socks, armbands, and wristbands.\n\nBye-bye, Donald\u2014and soon, bye-bye, Cliven. They are both repellant manifestations of things entrenched too long in our political culture.\n\nThe story will now fade\u2014except for the details of Sterling\u2019s acquiescence or resistance as the Clippers are finally sheared away from him. And Bundy, too, will be just an empty 10-gallon hat if and when he\u2019s ultimately held to account.

Bundy\u2019s \u201ccrude racism\u201d let Cruz, Paul, and Fox News flee a lawbreaker they never should have embraced in the first place.\n\nThat embrace is a symptom of a more fundamental evil older than America itself, and as new as Sterling, Bundy, and the Tea Party types inveighing about \u201ctaking our country back.\u201d From whom\u2014minorities, liberated women, and an African-American president, so often the subject of hate-filled caricature at their rallies? As Obama himself explained, the challenge here reaches beyond a Sterling or a Bundy: \u201cThe United States still wrestles with the legacy of race and slavery and segregation. I think we just have to remain hopeful that there has been a shift in how we view ourselves.\u201d\n\nBut hope isn\u2019t necessarily reality, and a new chapter of genuine equality and mutual respect demands a new politics, especially from the Republican Party. Richard Nixon pursued a \u201cSouthern Strategy,\u201d persistently protracted over half a century, that has harnessed white resentment about civil rights as a lever of electoral gain. Todd Purdum describes the result in his riveting landmark saga of the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act: \u201cOver the decades, Republican dominance of the South [has] continued.\u201d The title of Purdum\u2019s book is An Idea Whose Time Has Come. And with that idea has come a time when you can mostly, almost automatically, know across much of an entire region whether a voter is Republican simply by seeing if his or her skin is white.\n\nThat corrodes the character of the country, and it increasingly poisons Republican prospects in presidential contests as demography inexorably moves us toward an America where minorities are the emerging majority. Soon after abandoning Cliven Bundy, Rand Paul said: \u201cYou go to a Republican event and it\u2019s all white people. I tell people that the Republican Party has to look like the rest of America to have a chance.\u201d\n\nBut while Paul may broaden his rhetoric, his outreach is cramped. He has opposed the Violence Against Women Act, abortion rights even in cases of rape and incest, citizenship for children born here whose parents are undocumented immigrants, and protections for voting rights. He explained: \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any sort of systemic problem like there was in the South with precluding blacks from voting.\u201d And of course, on gay rights, his libertarianism is conveniently inconsistent: He\u2019s against letting same-sex couples marry. He also voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. What a way to bring African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, women, and LGBT and young voters to the GOP.\n\nPaul is not the exception but a paradigm in a Republican Party that has doubled down on the Southern Strategy\u2014and expanded it to other hot-button issues beyond race. The 2012 GOP campaigns were awash with proposals to outlaw certain forms of birth control, with claims of \u201clegitimate rape,\u201d with anti-immigrant calls to \u201cself-deport,\u201d and with concerted voter suppression schemes. Earlier, in 2004, the Bush re-election effort conspicuously rode the rails of anti-gay prejudice to drive voter turnout. Ken Mehlman, then the Bush campaign manager, has since become a powerful advocate for same-sex marriage and has said he\u2019s \u201csorry\u201d that \u201copposing equal rights is [now] a net negative that gets more problematic to voters each year.\u201d But that\u2019s exactly what the GOP continues to do in state party platforms such as Maine\u2019s, where gay marriage is already the law, and that\u2019s what primary voters in 2016 are likely to demand of their presidential aspirants.\n\nFinally, there is a less blatant but equally insidious assault on equal rights from a Supreme Court dominated by Republican appointees. Because one of them, Justice Anthony Kennedy, has strayed on gay rights, the court overturned the Defense of Marriage Act, but it also has cut the heart out of the Voting Rights Act\u00ad, which a young lawyer named John Roberts crusaded against at the Justice Department in the early 1980s. Ronald Reagan spurned his advice. Now as chief justice, Robert has voted to uphold a Michigan ban on affirmative action in state universities while continuing to permit set-asides for legacy admissions, or in-state students, or athletes.\n\nIn 2007, Roberts wrote: \u201cThe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\u201d To put it charitably, this is the jurisprudence of the simpleton. It ignores LBJ\u2019s profound insight that \u201cYou do not wipe away the scars of centuries [simply] by saying \u2018Now you are free.\u2019 You do not take a person who for years has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of the race and then say, \u2018You are free to compete with all the others,\u2019 and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.\u201d\n\nCliven Bundy and Donald Sterling have inflicted their own wounds on the American ideal. Bye-bye, Donald\u2014and soon, bye-bye, Cliven. They are both repellant manifestations of things entrenched too long in our political culture, the willful manipulations of the Southern Strategy, and ideologically driven injustice and indifference from the rightward side of the judiciary. When will the time come to say goodbye to all that? It would be good for America. It would be good for the GOP.\n\nIt would be good, morally and politically, for the party of Lincoln to honor him at last and hear and heed \u201cthe better angels of our nature.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:09.557+0000"}

But behind closed doors, corporate influence peddlers are more powerful than ever.\n\nAt some point in the early part of this century, America was treated to the concept of Bush Derangement Syndrome. The illness, Charles Krauthammer explained, entailed \u201cthe acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal people in reaction to the policies, the presidency\u2014nay\u2014the very existence of George W. Bush.\u201d\n\nThen, as the day follows the night, Americans were bestowed with Obama Derangement Syndrome\u2014an instinctual hostility to anything and everything the president said or did.\n\nThe operative definition of political derangement began to shift from the minute these \u201csyndromes\u201d were first \u201cdiagnosed.\u201d Fortunately, the online dictionary is just a click away. Derangement, it turns out, actually means \u201ca permutation of the elements of a set such that none of the elements appear in their original position.\u201d\n\nIn other words, derangement isn\u2019t about paranoia or hostility. It\u2019s more akin to congenital hypocrisy\u2014inexorably deviating from what you started out saying or doing.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve sorted out that bit of linguistic accuracy, it\u2019s time to focus on the most egregious and revolting syndrome on display this summer: Lobbyist Derangement Syndrome.\n\nLobbyist Derangement Syndrome knows no clique or party. Much like herpes, it can lay dormant for months or years, only to flare up with shocking results. And so, with a surprising suddenness, it has recently bloomed up among Republicans and Democrats alike.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has long used lobbyists as scapegoats. As Lee Fang recounted at The Nation, Obama made them a centerpiece of his campaign. \u201cWe are up against the belief,\u201d he railed, \u201cthat it\u2019s all right for lobbyists to dominate our government, that they are just part of the system in Washington. But we know that the undue influence of lobbyists is part of the problem, and this election is our chance to say that we\u2019re not going to let them stand in our way anymore.\u201d\n\nLess than a month in office, Obama signed an executive order officially observing that registered lobbyists were unwelcome at the White House.\n\nIn other words, derangement isn\u2019t about paranoia or hostility. It\u2019s more akin to congenital hypocrisy\u2014inexorably deviating from what you started out saying or doing.\n\nBut, as Fang continued, the administration quickly evolved away from that position. \u201cObama\u2019s only significant act to curb the influence of lobbyists is now seen as a failure. In fact, in many ways, he only made the problem worse.\u201d\n\nYet the president refused to drop his demagoguery. Just this week, he told The Economist that corporations are lobbying too hard for lower taxes and the like. In literally the very same breath, however, he let slip that they ought to be lobbying even harder\u2014for his agenda:\n\n\u201cWhen they come and they have lunch with me [\u2026] and they\u2019ll say, you know what, we really care about the environment, and we really care about education, and we really care about getting immigration reform done\u2014then my challenge to them consistently is, is your lobbyist working as hard on those issues as he or she is on preserving that tax break that you\u2019ve got? And if the answer is no, then you don\u2019t care about it as much as you say.\u201d\n\nNot only is this deranged in the technical sense. It\u2019s deranged in the pejorative. Sadly, Republicans\u2014who have repeatedly slammed Obama for this kind of blithe incoherence\u2014are not immune to the same disorder.\n\nTake the nasty case of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who sat down recently to interview for a new communications director with the aid of John Feehery, a high-powered lobbyist. That\u2019s right\u2014a sitting member of Congress with a leadership position brought in a registered super-lobbyist to help him pick the right hire for his team.\n\nNot, as a lawyer might say, that there\u2019s anything wrong with that. In all likelihood, Scalise hasn\u2019t run afoul of any House ethics rules. Nevertheless, the influence of the lobbyist-loving Feehery wing of the GOP is plain to see. Just a few weeks before he was outed in the Scalise meeting, Feehery penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed on \u201cthe risk in Republican hostility to big business\u201d\u2014accompanied by the world\u2019s smallest violin.\n\nFreehy was particularly worried about the hostility towards the Export-Import Bank, an agency that doles out millions of dollars every year to well-connected corporations. Populists on both sides of the aisle have long decried the bank as \u201clittle more than a fund for a fund for corporate welfare,\u201d to borrow then-Senator Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 memorable description.\n\n\u201cAmid the fight for the soul of the Republican Party,\u201d he intoned, \u201csome elements of the GOP coalition have become overtly hostile to Big Business. [\u2026] The Export-Import Bank has become the latest in a long line of targets,\u201d groaned Feehery, raising the specter of a Chamber of Commerce defection to the Dems. \u201cWhat would happen,\u201d he cried out, \u201cif Big Business decided to change sides?\u201d\n\nHe sighed. \u201cHow the Export-Import Bank\u201d became a target \u201cfor Tea Party wrath is a little strange to me.\u201d\n\nExcept, wait. That last quote wasn\u2019t Feehery. It was Barack Obama, in that Economist interview this week.\n\nLobbyists and the politicians who love them have already won the fight for the soul of both parties.

If the upstart wins, the Democrats are in play for the first time in a generation.\n\nRegardless of what happens in Mississippi\u2019s Senate runoff, the Democratic nominee former Congressman Travis Childers will spend the next six months as a protector of the elderly and the infirm.\n\nIf the Republican incumbent Thad Cochran manages to pull through his runoff against a Tea Party challenger, Childers will return to managing the nursing home he owns in North Mississippi. He\u2019ll likely take time off from his day job to appear in a parade or two over the summer and go through all the motions of being a candidate but it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll find the duties of being a major party nominee for Senate to be any more pressing than running his local neighborhood association.\n\nBut, if right-winger Chris McDaniel takes the Republican nomination, things will suddenly change. Childers\u2019 campaign, which has been in a political cocoon, will burst into life in what would become one of the most watched races in the country. The Democrat will present himself as a conservative blue dog fighting to protect the legacy of the 76-year-old Cochran from a radical Tea Party extremist like McDaniel. Childers\u2019 problem is that, at present, he has a rudimentary website, hidden on Google, and has raised just over $50,000 in an effort to win a Senate seat that has been held by Cochran since 1978.\n\nIf his opponent is McDaniel, the controversial, bomb-throwing, scandal plagued GOP challenger, Childers has a decent chance of being the first Democratic senator elected from Mississippi since 1982. However, the path for a Democratic candidate in the deeply racially polarized Magnolia State isn\u2019t easy. Childers would need to rev up his campaign dramatically and start raising serious money while building a campaign staff capable of turning out African American voters and persuading whites who have abandoned the Democratic Party in national races to return to their past allegiances one more time. It\u2019s not that he has an uphill climb but he is doing it from a standing start.\n\nA pro-life, pro-gun candidate named Travis is likely to significantly outperform Barack Obama among white southerners.\n\nWhile national pundits are deeply skeptical of Childers\u2019s chances in a one-on-one faceoff, noting that Obama won only 10% of the white vote in Mississippi in 2012, both Democrats as well as Mississippi Republicans affiliated with Cochran see a different picture. After all, Childers would only need to only get about 1 in 4 white voters on his side and a pro-life, pro-gun candidate named Travis is likely to significantly outperform Barack Obama among white southerners\u2014-especially when Obama isn\u2019t even on the ballot. Further, at least one private poll shows Childers in a statistical tie with McDaniel in a November matchup.\n\nThe contours of a Childers-McDaniel general election are still unclear. There are no public polls and there are still three weeks left for the runoff to get even dirtier than the bitter primary fight we have seen so far. However, in a year where Republicans once felt confident that they could run the table and take back the Senate, nominating McDaniel would give Democrats one more opportunity to steal a seat and allow Harry Reid to keep his role as Majority Leader.

So now Republicans\u2019 mission to weaken the president is spilling over into foreign policy, too.\n\nYou know those people who carry on all the time about how the United States looks weak to the world, and how we have to do everything we possibly can to help poor Ukraine stand up to the evil Vladimir Putin? Well, guess what they just did? They just made the United States look weak to the world\u2014and they actually just reduced (yes, reduced) the amount of global aid that can flow to Ukraine to help it stand up to the evil Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe deal was this: The Obama administration\u2019s aid package to Ukraine placed before the Senate included some long-sought International Monetary Fund reforms. These reforms, which the administration agreed to in 2010 with the leading nations of Europe, and which those nations have already signed off on, would have helped Ukraine get more money from the IMF after this quick tranche from the United States ran dry. It\u2019s complicated, but in essence, the reforms shifted money from one narrow spending category to a broader one that could be tapped by countries for projects like building and sustaining democracy, of which Ukraine is in rather desperate need. So while there wasn\u2019t a specific dollar figure on the table, the IMF reforms could potentially, a Senate Democratic aide explained to me, have led to several billion more in aid to the country.\n\nWhat\u2019s to object to? To Republicans, this: The reforms include an increase in the U.S. contribution quota to the IMF of $63 billion. They would also give more voice to emerging nations. Now, these two measures are offset by the facts that 1) the overall U.S. expenditure on the IMF wouldn\u2019t go up, because the U.S. would be allowed to decrease other commitments by a like amount, and 2) the U.S. would still have enough voting shares at IMF meetings to retain the veto power it has currently.\n\nBut those points don\u2019t matter on the right, of course. Over there, it all spells a diminution of American power, the hated global governance, like Pat Buchanan\u2019s old warnings about sending our boys out to global hotspots donning light-blue (i.e. United Nations) helmets. John McCain and Bob Corker, to their credit, supported the aid with the IMF reform tacked on. But most Republicans didn\u2019t, and even though the full package easily passed a procedural vote, Democrats were getting the strong sense that an aid deal with the IMF stuff included wasn\u2019t going to make it.\n\nAnd so, it emerged this week that the Obama administration and Senate Democrats apparently backed off their demand for the Ukraine aid bill on Capitol Hill to include the reforms. On Monday, John Kerry visited Congress and threw in the towel. Better to have whatever we can get now than fight over this and delay matters. Or worse, lose altogether, because there was no chance that the House would ever have passed the IMF-laden version.\n\nLet\u2019s take stock of this. The Crimea/Ukraine crisis broke. Republicans immediately were all over Obama for being weak. The whole thing was his fault. We are all Ukrainians now. We had to stand with Ukraine to send a strong message to the malefactor Putin.\n\nSo what happens when the bill reaches them? The Obama administration tries to live up to an agreement it made\u2014with our friends, our closest allies\u2014four years ago at an opportune moment to press the issue, thinking that the idea that the reform would be of use to Ukraine might help matters. But as with everything, opposition to Obama is more important than anything else. If he\u2019s for it, they\u2019re against it. If Ukraine gets less money because of that, well, tough cheese for them.\n\nAs with everything, opposition to Obama is more important than anything else. If he\u2019s for it, they\u2019re against it. If Ukraine gets less money because of that, well, tough cheese for them.\n\nAnd so it happens that the people who caterwaul about America being weak in the world become the very people who make it weaker. What does the world think as it watches this? Maybe some think merely that Obama is weak. But I\u2019d wager most don\u2019t. I\u2019d wager most Europeans and others reach the right and reasonable conclusion: That American partisan dysfunction, driven far more by Republicans than by Democrats, now weakens not just our ability to carry out domestic politics but our foreign-policy aims as well.\n\nNothing like this has happened in decades. Yes Democrats\u2014and several moderate Republicans, let\u2019s remember, like John Sherman Cooper and Jacob Javits\u2014blocked funding for the Vietnam War. But at least they were acting in accord with their long-stated principles and goal of ending that war. Today, Republicans are opposing their own stated principle of helping Ukraine as much as possible. Sen. Ted Cruz even went so far as to say that the proposed IMF reforms weakened the U.S. and strengthened Russia (I asked his spokesman to explain why this was so, and he wrote me back but never delivered an answer). In fact, Russia, Reuters has reported, is on record urging the IMF to adopt the reforms without U.S. support, and small wonder: Doing so would mean the end of the U.S. veto. So the Obama administration position of buying into the reforms is clearly something Russia doesn\u2019t want to see.\n\nExcept for the very early days of the Cold War, politics never really quite stopped at the water\u2019s edge. But politics did soften at the water\u2019s edge. Not anymore. The Republicans are dug in, and as a result they are causing the very decline in standing and prestige that they are blaming on Obama.

Publish an app that lets voters take selfies with the candidate because obviously that\u2019s the ticket to bumping up public support.\n\nRand Paul\u2019s candidacy, initially billed as a buoyant entry injecting fresh ideas in a quasi-sleepy, pre-Trump field, has now been called all but dead .\n\nIt\u2019s been a summertime of sadness for the blue-eyed boy from Kentucky.\n\nHis June fundraising total was a paltry $7 million and the head of his super PAC was indicted for bribery the night before the first GOP debate.\n\nAs the vultures have circled ever closer, even Paul said his chances of winning the nomination are now \u201cone in ten.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Paul had to go all the way into the Alaskan wilderness to find people not overcome by Trump mania. The final piece to his rehabilitation strategy seems to be the app \u201cRandPaul2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator Paul has continuously led the Republican field, and largely both sides of the aisle in his use of digital engagement,\u201d Vince Harris said.\n\nPaul\u2019s campaign has been feverishly promoting the app that launched in the Apple Store on Wednesday. It allows users to take selfies next to the floating, seemingly severed head of the Kentucky senator.\n\nGideon Resnick/The Daily Beast\n\nThe official Twitter account for the candidate tweeted four times in three hours including an instructional video for actually downloading the scintillating new product. Hours later after the campaign encouraged users to send selfies with the hashtag #selfieswithrand, people promptly responded with a barrage of images of their genitalia. One of the first things that shows up on screen in the app is an option to donate to the campaign and if the user allows for location tracking, the application will send notifications about upcoming events in the area. There is also an option to make memes and share them with the massive Rand Paul meme-sharing community.\n\nGideon Resnick/The Daily Beast\n\nPaul is no stranger to digital campaign strategies, having employed SnapChat since early 2014 to talk to constituents and reporters alike. He employs Vincent Harris as his chief digital strategist, who also runs Harris Media, a digital public affairs firm headquartered in Austin. Harris said in an email exchange with The Daily Beast that the app was by no means released right now to try to bring attention back to Paul\u2019s campaign in its drastic time of need but, in fact, was in the works over the last six months.\n\n\u201cSenator Paul has continuously led the Republican field, and largely both sides of the aisle in his use of digital engagement,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThis is just another example of his campaign doing that.\u201d\n\nRand Paul\u2019s Twitter account has been retweeting images from users who include the hashtag #StandWithRand, which is supposed to serve as a means of promoting the candidate\u2019s message. Not really sure what message this conveys.\n\nvia Twitter\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing it being used as a tool to promote the Senators brand and message,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThis is in contrast for other apps where some candidates have focused on them specifically as a place to essentially store press releases.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harris, there are no financial figures available as to how much money has been contributed to the campaign through the app yet.\n\nThe website CanDo.com, a Cincinnati-based company which has also made an app for Tide Dry Cleaners , is listed as the URL in the app store associated with \u201cRandPaul2016.\u201d They have not returned a request for comment from the Daily Beast.\n\nThere is no precedent for knowing whether selfies with a candidate improve poll numbers.

With a vitriol usually reserved for rapists and traitors, some of the most extreme Palmetto State conservatives have burned Graham in effigy and then flushed him down a toilet; derided him as a \u201cwar mongering, cowardly, fiscal liberal whore;\u201d openly questioned the unmarried senator\u2019s sexuality with the label \u201cMiss Lindsey,\u201d and promised Low Country voters a 2014 primary challenge against Graham of epic proportions. \u201cBuckle your seat belts, South Carolina,\u201d teased the conservative blog FITSNews.com in 2013, \u201cAnother brutal GOP primary season is about to unfold.\u201d\n\nBut as primary day dawns Tuesday in South Carolina, Graham\u2019s path to reelection has proven to be more boring than brutal. The half-dozen subpar challengers he faces are all wallowing in the single digits, while Graham has dominated the field throughout. The only real suspense on election night will be whether Graham wins with more or less than 50% of the vote. Less than 50% would put him into a runoff. More than 50% will close the chapter on the biggest nothing-burger in the Tea Party\u2019s uneven electoral history, a potential non-upset that says as much about Graham\u2019s focus and political savvy as it does about the neutered state of the Tea Party in South Carolina.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to win outright,\u201d predicted Allen Olson, the founder of the Columbia, S.C., Tea Party. Unlike the most vocal of Graham\u2019s Tea Party haters, Olson said he is for limited government, balanced budgets, and Lindsey Graham. \u201cI like the fact that he fights for conservative principles and that, instead of acting like Ted Cruz, where it\u2019s my-way-or-the-highway, Lindsey Graham is willing to at least negotiate and talk with the Democrats and come to a compromise.\u201d\n\nOlson also said that after years of activism, he is no longer active with his own Tea Party, which he said has strayed from its roots in fiscal conservatism into pet political crusades of individual members. \u201cI still consider myself a member of the Tea Party as it started out, but not what it\u2019s become,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in limited government, but I also believe in responsible government. Saying no to everything is not responsible government.\u201d\n\nOlson\u2019s drift from the Tea Party is not unique in the state, but it is indicative of why the Tea Party isn\u2019t about to knock Graham out in South Carolina. Despite all the bluster, he\u2019s just more popular than they are. While Graham has a 43% approval rating that is trending upward, fewer than 6% of registered voters in the state identified as members of the Tea Party in a Winthrop University poll last month. A similar 2013 poll found that less than 10% of registered Republicans considered themselves Tea Party members.\n\nWhile Graham may be on the outs with some Tea Partiers, he has shored up his support among many of the state\u2019s key conservative constituencies. According to LaDonna Ryggs, chairwoman of the Spartanburg County GOP, Graham is \u201ca hero\u201d to the significant pro-life forces in the state, a go-to dealmaker for business interests, and a reliable ally for the defense industry and pro-Israel Christian conservatives.\n\nWhile Graham may be on the outs with some Tea Partiers, he has shored up his support among many of the state\u2019s key conservative constituencies.\n\nThat broad support has helped him raise a massive $11 million for his race, a sum of money that would scare off any potential rival. But the biggest key to Graham\u2019s success in outflanking his right flank in 2014 has been the fact that, even after pushing for immigration reform, entertaining climate legislation, and voting for President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominees, none of the state\u2019s six sitting Republican congressmen challenged Graham for his job, including talented up-and-comers like Reps. Trey Gowdy or Mick Mulvaney.\n\n\u201cThey like the guy. They are friends,\u201d Ryggs said of the House delegation\u2019s relationship with Graham. \u201cLindsey is Mark Sanford\u2019s son\u2019s godfather. Trey Gowdy is good friends with Lindsey. Plus Lindsey served in the state house and Mick Mulvaney and Jeff Duncan have known him through that. A lot of people don\u2019t realize that he is the senior statesman that keeps that group together.\u201d\n\nBut even friendship in politics has its limits and Politico recently detailed the lengths Graham has gone to keep Gowdy, Mulvaney, and other potential rivals happily serving in the House instead of mounting a challenge against him, including his consistent lobbying on their behalf for their districts, or working with John Boehner to get Mulvaney a plum committee assignment to keep him happy in his day job.\n\nWith the House members on the sidelines, Tea Party groups could have come together to get behind one candidate as a single alternative to Graham in 2014, but that never happened. Instead, six candidates claiming to be the most conservative crowded into the field one by one and proceeded to divide the 51% of possible anti-Graham votes among themselves, leaving Graham with an open shot at keeping his job.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was their egos or what, but they couldn\u2019t just decide on a single person,\u201d Ryggs said. \u201cThe more people that got into it, the less credible it seemed.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:11.810+0000"}
{"entityId": 1753, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "He\u2019s the first major candidate to put his partner in a campaign ad. Why are pro-gay groups against him?\n\nIn February, an openly gay Republican candidate for Congress became the first in the history of either party to feature his partner in a campaign ad. The brief shot of the couple, hands interlocked, was followed by footage of the candidate holding a rainbow flag. \u201cWho is this man?\u201d the ads narrator asked. \u201cCarl DeMaio.\u201d\n\nDeMaio, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is one of three candidates, including Republicans Fred J. Simon and Kirk Jorgensen, running in an open primary to unseat first-term incumbent, Democrat Scott Peters, in California\u2019s 52nd Congressional district, which includes much of central and coastal San Diego.\n\nDeMaio\u2019s earlier political career was partly defined by his inability to gain the support of the LGBT community\u2014despite a series of vicious homophobic smears against him. Now DeMaio is campaigning, at least in part, on his ability to survive those anti-gay assaults. But as two other gay Republican congressional candidates\u2014Dan Innis in New Hampshire and Richard Tisei in Massachusetts\u2014find themselves in the good graces of LGBT-centered groups, the question arises: Is it hard for gay Republicans to find support in the LGBT community, or is it just hard for DeMaio?\n\nThe race between DeMaio and Rep. Peters is highly competitive. A June 2013 10News poll showed DeMaio leading Rep. Peters by nearly ten points. To help close the gap, DeMaio is employing an unusual tactic: the openly gay candidate is trumpeting how much the LGBT groups hate him.\n\nDeMaio, who looks about a decade younger than his 39 years, was born in Dubuque, Iowa, and moved with his family to Orange County, California in the late \u201870s. In 1990, DeMaio\u2019s father abandoned his family. Two weeks later, his mother died. \u201cAt age 14, Carl was taken in by Jesuits and given the opportunity to earn his way to Georgetown University,\u201d his website says.\n\nAfter graduating from Georgetown, DeMaio founded two think tanks and served a term in the San Diego City Council. The end of DeMaio\u2019s term on the Council in 2012 coincided with the retirement of Mayor Jerry Sanders. DeMaio mounted a campaign for mayor, running against then-Rep. Bob Filner.\n\nThings got very dirty very quickly.\n\n\u201cTo be really, frankly honest, I\u2019m disappointed in the DeMaio campaign for the attacks against an organization they haven\u2019t sought an endorsement from yet.\u201d\n\n\n\nFilner charged that DeMaio\u2019s partner Jonathan Hale, the publisher of the San Diego Gay & Lesbian News, had contributed to vandalism at Balboa Park, where a water-gun fight got out of control, resulting in $19,000 in damage to a lily pond. Hale\u2019s publication, Filner charged, had played up the water gun fight in the days leading up to the event. \u201cIs it a lie that this event, illegal event, an illegal event which led to illegal captivity was promoted on websites that he controls and owns?\u201d Filner said.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News this week, DeMaio said Filner \u201cattacked my partner repeatedly in press conferences, just to point out the fact that I was gay.\u201d\n\nDuring DeMaio\u2019s mayoral campaign, a political action committee formed to helped defeat him. The PAC, deceptively called Conservatives for Gay Rights Supporting Carl DeMaio for Mayor 2012, paid for robocalls and literature that reminded voters DeMaio is gay.\n\nThe voice on the PAC\u2019s robocalls asked, \u201cIf you knew Carl DeMaio was the first openly gay man to be elected to our San Diego City Council, would you be more likely or less likely to vote for Carl DeMaio or does this fact make no difference?\u201d\n\nThe literature the group distributed featured a photoshopped image of DeMaio standing near a man dressed in drag. They were allegedly sent to members of the African American community.\n\nGregory T. Angelo, Executive Director of the Log Cabin Republicans\u2014which has endorsed DeMaio\u2019s congressional bid\u2014told The Daily Beast the incident is \u201can example of both gay baiting and race baiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf anyone on the right had put out a postcard against a gay Democrat with a photoshopped image of a drag queen next to them, and sent it to individuals specifically within the African American community, liberals would be howling, and it would become a nation-wide story\u2026When we talk about liberal hypocrisy, and especially liberal hypocrisy within the LGBT community, this is what we\u2019re referring to.\u201d\n\n(In 2013, the PAC was fined $7,500 by the San Diego Ethics Commission for violating campaign disclosure laws.)\n\nAnd yet, despite the homophobic attacks, many LGBT groups either declined to endorse DeMaio or were openly hostile to him during the mayor\u2019s race. The openly gay candidate was even booed at a local gay pride parade.\n\nA major point of contention for the LGBT community during DeMaio\u2019s mayoral campaign was his silence on Proposition 8, a state constitutional amendment created by same sex marriage opponents, which banned gay marriage in the state of California. The initiative passed, but was ultimately ruled unconstitutional by a federal court. DeMaio did not publicly take a position on the ballot initiative.\n\n\u201cI was working on the Prop 8 campaign and called Carl to ask him to publicly oppose Prop 8. He told me he wouldn\u2019t do that because it would hurt him in his city council race,\u201d said Fred Sainz, Vice President of Communications and Marketing at the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nSainz said DeMaio\u2019s refusal to vocally oppose Prop 8 \u201cspeaks to his character and judgment\u2026 It was not a principled moment for him, which makes you wonder how many tradeoffs he makes every day if a position is not in his best political interest.\u201d\n\nOne of DeMaio\u2019s campaign contributors, U-T San Diego publisher Doug Manchester, donated $125,000 to Proposition 8.\n\nAsked about the donation, a spokesman for DeMaio, Dave McCulloch, said \u201cCarl DeMaio has had a broad-based donor base of well over 9,000,\u201d and that all of his donors are aware of his support for marriage equality.\n\n\u201cHe stayed silent,\u201d Rep. Peters\u2019 campaign spokeswoman, Maryanne Pintar, said. \u201cAnd [he] took money from the leading backer of the Yes On 8 measure and would not stand with his community.\u201d\n\nDeMaio maintained throughout his candidacy that while he supported same sex marriage, discussing it during a mayoral race amounted to little more than political theater. It is not, after all, the job of a mayor to pass laws about unions between people\u2014gay or otherwise.\n\nThe argument didn\u2019t appear to work. Come election day, DeMaio was defeated 52.5 percent to 47.5 percent by Filner.\n\n(Filner\u2019s tenure as mayor was short and controversial. In July 2013, Filner announced he would be taking a leave of absence \u201cto undergo two weeks of intensive therapy\u201d following multiple allegations that he had sexually harassed female staffers. After he finally resigned, he pled guilty to false imprisonment and misdemeanor battery, and served three months house arrest.)\n\nBy then, DeMaio was in the middle of a new campaign\u2014this one, for Congress\u2014and once again being hit with brutal and personal attacks.\n\nThe Voice of OC reported DeMaio had been caught masturbating in a mens\u2019 room during City Council meetings. \u201cIn the months before last November\u2019s mayoral election, Ben Hueso, the City Council\u2019s president in 2009, acknowledged to this reporter that he witnessed DeMaio engaging in the practice twice.\u201d\n\nThe publication quoted Hueso as saying \u201cDeMaio was masturbating. He jumped, caught by surprise. He jumped to the sink\u2026saying \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry\u2019 about six times. Then washed his hands, darted out.\u201d The publication wrote that Councilwoman Marti Emerald had confirmed the account.\n\nDeMaio responded to the \u201cvicious rumor\u201d by taking a polygraph test, which he passed. Hueso refused to take a polygraph test.\n\nAsked by The Daily Beast why he thought two lawmakers went on record to lie about the event in the first place, McCulloch, DeMaio\u2019s spokesperson, said, \u201cBy repeating a disgusting allegation that has been convincingly rebutted with facts, Daily Beast shows it is willing to help smear Carl DeMaio.\u201d\n\nThis week, DeMaio was the subject of a piece by Fox News contributor Dana Perino which asked why the LGBT community has shown hostility towards the candidate.\n\n\u201cDeMaio has been the target of homophobic attacks. But where are those attacks coming from? It\u2019s not always from the far right social conservatives you\u2019d expect; rather, it\u2019s been from DeMaio\u2019s left\u2014the liberal and Democrat-affiliated groups that you\u2019d think would be proud that an openly gay successful businessman has decided to run for office.\"\n\nPerino quotes DeMaio as telling her, \u201cI\u2019ve found more tolerance, acceptance and inclusion from social conservative groups who have to reconcile that I\u2019m a Republican who happens to be gay\u2026versus the intolerance the LGBT leaders see me as a gay man who happens to be a Republican.\u201d\n\nWhen the Victory Fund, a gay-friendly PAC, endorsed 2014\u2019s other two gay Republican congressional candidates but not DeMaio, McCulloch said \u201cwe\u2019re not surprised they\u2019re not endorsing him in what national observers call the most likely seat to switch parties in the country\u2026When it matters, the group is about a liberal agenda.\u201d\n\nBut Victory Fund spokesman Stephen Thai said DeMaio\u2019s camp has it all wrong. Thai noted that DeMaio did not submit to be endorsed by the Victory Fund for his congressional race, so they couldn\u2019t have endorsed him even if they wanted to. (The group did decline to endorse DeMaio during his mayoral race.)\n\nVictory, Thai explained, has a policy of not commenting on races in which they haven\u2019t endorsed a candidate. \u201cI\u2019m making an exception on this, because to be really, frankly honest, I\u2019m disappointed in the DeMaio campaign for the attacks against an organization they haven\u2019t sought an endorsement from yet.\u201d\n\nSo far in 2014, the Victory Fund has endorsed 104 Democrats and 4 Republicans.\n\nWith the exception of the Log Cabin Republicans and GOProud, no major LGBT organization has endorsed DeMaio. And so he is continuing his unorthodox strategy of portraying himself as the openly-gay victim of both homophobic smears \u2014 and of attacks from the left-wing, pro-gay lobby.\n\nThe latest iteration of that strategy came this week, when DeMaio appeared on Fox News. A photo of Rep. Peters flashed on screen as host Martha MacCallum explained to viewers that \u201can openly gay congressional candidate has become the target of attack ads from liberal groups who are supposed to be preaching about tolerance and understanding.\u201d\n\nRep. Peters\u2019 campaign did not appreciate the visual, which they believe could have led viewers to think Rep. Peters himself had waged homophobic attacks against DeMaio.\n\n\u201cIt was egregiously misleading, and I was, frankly, really surprised that a news organization would do something that was so misleading\u2026Whether that came from Mr. DeMaio himself or Fox News, I can\u2019t say,\" Rep. Peters' spokeswoman, Maryanne Pintar, told The Daily Beast.\n\nWhile homophobia from his opponents unquestionably plagued DeMaio during his mayoral campaign, it\u2019s hard to argue his current opponent is somehow anti-gay. Rep. Peters has long been a supporter of LGBT rights. In 2000, when he first ran for the City Council, he publicly opposed Proposition 22, which restricted marriage for same sex couples. The Human Rights Campaign PAC has endorsed Peters for reelection, calling him \u201ca strong leader and advocate for equality.\u201d In the wake of the HRC\u2019s endorsement, GOProud criticized the group, saying their endorsement \u201cprevents an openly gay man from attaining office.\u201d The freshman Rep. has not been directly accused of homophobia by DeMaio.\n\nBut regardless of how recent the attempts at character assaults, the very fact that they were ever lobbed by those on the left are, Gregory T. Angelo, Executive Director of the Log Cabin Republicans said, an indication that Democrats aren\u2019t sure how to react to Republican\u2019s encroaching on their LGBT territory.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing is the Democratic party that is fearful that they are about to lose the stranglehold that they\u2019ve had on the gay vote for decades\u2026 I see Republicans having much more to gain from a DeMaio victory and Democrats having much more to lose from a DeMaio victory, at the end of the day.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: DeMaio's spokesman, Dave McCulloch, has responded to the Human Rights Campaign's Fred Sainz, saying \"Fred Sainz's claim that Carl DeMaio refused to speak out on Prop 8 because of his City Council election is easily proven false. I guess Fred didn't check the timeline, because DeMaio actually won his City Council in the primary in 2008 and had already won his City Council seat by the time the Prop 8 campaign got underway in the summer of 2008.\"\n\nCorrection: an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated a June 2013 10News poll had been conducted in February.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:11.992+0000"}

Take California agribusiness, which contributes mightily to Republicans in the state. The industry generates more than $45 billion annually in revenue, and it would shrivel up like a raisin in the sun without illegal immigrants.\n\nIndeed, a big reason that the nation\u2019s most populous state is home to an estimated 2.5 million illegal immigrants is because it\u2019s also home to countless farmers, ranchers, restaurateurs, hoteliers, construction firms, small-businessmen, and homeowners who rely on illegal immigrant labor for their slice of the California Dream. This game is all about supply and demand, and you never hear those tough-talking Republicans say anything about cracking down on the demand side.\n\nMeanwhile, California Democrats want a gigantic expansion of rights, benefits and protections for the undocumented.\n\nTheir message is \u201cbienvenidos.\u201d In their language, that translates to: \u201cWelcome to California. Stay a while. You\u2019re just as good as anyone born in this country, and so we\u2019re going to give you the same rights and privileges they have. We can\u2019t give you legal status or a green card. But we can give you a lot of other things to make your stay more comfortable.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference in Sacramento, a group of Democratic legislators\u2014switching back and forth between English and Spanish\u2014recently unveiled a package of 10 bills that would, among other things: create an Office of New Americans in the governor\u2019s office to better serve the undocumented; provide illegal immigrants with subsidized health care by extending Medi-Cal coverage to all Californians, regardless of immigration status; limit use of \u201cE-Verify\u201d (the government-run database that employers use to check if prospective hires are legally eligible to work) and prevent \u201cabuse\u201d by employers; and ban businesses from discriminating against residents based on their immigration status, citizenship, or language.\n\nThe health care provision is the most expensive item on the menu, with a tab that was originally set at $1.3 billion.\n\nThat last one is a beauty. If it extends to hiring, it flies in the face of federal law, namely the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act that made it a federal crime to knowingly hire an illegal immigrant. Now California wants to make it a state crime to not hire one? Employers can now pick their poison: They can violate one law or the other.\n\nI question the motivation for this outburst of legislative generosity. And I have a theory as to why they are doing this now.\n\nFor the last few years, President Obama was deporting an average of 400,000 illegal immigrants every 12 months and unlawfully detaining thousands of women and children from Central America in horrendous conditions. Meanwhile, the Democratic members of the California legislature\u2014even the Latino Caucus\u2014were saying nada about it, and I\u2019ve wondered how they were going to work through their guilt and atone for this dereliction of duty.\n\nNow, with the California Democrats\u2019 grab bag of giveaways, freebies and protections, we have the answer.\n\nThere is some good in this hash, but you have to go digging for it. One of the bills proposed would protect immigrants from attorneys and consultants who prey on them and demand advance payment for services. It would also require that the clients of these practitioners be given a toll-free number so that, in case of fraud, they can report them to the State Bar of California. Both of these proposals should be welcomed.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s plenty of bad to go along with the good, and the pushback seems to have caught Democrats flat-footed. Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles), said the avalanche of bills\u2014which serves as a dramatic affront to nativists and other immigration restrictionists\u2014\u201cunequivocally state California\u2019s commitment to immigrants.\u201d And de Le\u00f3n says doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would object to what he and other Democrats are trying to ram through.\n\n\u201cWhat is it that we fear in opening our arms to the millions already here?\u201d he asked.\n\nWell, the cost for one thing. The health care provision is the most expensive item on the menu, with a tab that was originally set at $1.3 billion. Yet no one will say where the money is supposed to come from in cash-strapped California.\n\nAnd aside from the price tag, let me tell you what bothers me about this Bill of Rights for illegal immigrants.\n\nIt\u2019s not the feeble arguments offered by conservative pundits, columnists, and radio hosts. Liberals don\u2019t understand much about the immigration debate, but they look like geniuses next to conservatives who understand less.\n\nMost of what they\u2019re saying on the right is rubbish. These bills are not intended to lure illegal immigrants to California; we already do that with jobs. They do not signal that Democrats want an open border; the union members who control the Democratic Party oppose that, which could explain why, far from advocating for an open border, Democrats in Congress keep voting to fortify the border.\n\nAnd finally, it is not true that illegal immigrants pay no taxes; they pay sales, payroll, and property taxes whether they own or rent. In fact, some even pay federal income taxes because Uncle Sam was kind enough to create an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number to allow those who lack Social Security numbers to dread April 15 like the rest of us.\n\nSo what bothers me about these types of bills? Two things.\n\nFirst, the undocumented never asked for these things. I\u2019ve interviewed dozens of illegal immigrants over the years, and they always say they want three things and only three things from this country\u2014a work permit, a driver\u2019s license, and the ability to travel back and forth across borders to visit the families they left behind. The rest is just window dressing whipped up by politicians to serve their agendas, not those of immigrants.\n\nSecond, these kinds of legislative giveaways serve to legitimize unlawful behavior. It\u2019s still a crime\u2014correction, a civil infraction\u2014to enter the United States illegally or overstay a visa and we shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed about saying so. Every time we chip away at the infraction of trampling our borders\u2014whether it\u2019s by pressuring media companies to stop using the phrase \u201cillegal immigrant,\u201d or showering the undocumented with things they didn\u2019t even ask for, we make it more socially acceptable to be an illegal immigrant.\n\nHow is that in the national interest? And what incentive does it provide others to come to this country legally? For that matter, what incentive does it give the undocumented to attempt to change their status if there ever is anything resembling comprehensive immigration reform? Why bother if, thanks to well-intentioned but misguided Democratic legislators in California, you\u2019re already comfortable the way you are?\n\nThese questions deserve answers that the politicians who run this state won\u2019t provide. That\u2019s unacceptable, and it should spell the end of California\u2019s great immigrant giveaway.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:12.734+0000"}

Indeed, for the last six years, monthly data like the employment report \u2013as well as new initiatives and proposals to get the economy rolling\u2014have been greeted by critics with apocalyptic declarations. For the last six years, we\u2019ve seen a continuing response from Republicans: Under the set of policies pursued by President Obama (some of them continuations of policies enacted by President Bush) and of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke (a Bush appointee) and Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen, the U.S. economic ship is like the Titanic\u2014rudderless in dangerous seas, bound for doom, about to sink.\n\nLet\u2019s review some of the greatest hits. In March 2009, at the depths of the recession, when the stimulus bill passed Michael Boskin, economic adviser to the first President Bush, took to the Wall Street Journal editorial page on March 6, 2009, to proclaim \u201dObama\u2019s Radicalism is Killing the Dow.\u201d Were his budget and stimulus plans to be adopted, the U.S. would risk becoming a \u201cEuropean-style social welfare state with its concomitant long-run economic stagnation.\u201d That day, the Dow touched, 6,600. Almost immediately, the markets commenced a raging, historical bull run. The Dow closed Friday at 17,737, an increase of 168 percent from March 2009.\n\nIn February, 2011, Rep. Paul Ryan, the former vice presidential candidate, took out after Bernanke, arguing that the Fed\u2019s efforts to support an economy still laboring under the fallout of a financial crisis and a deep recession were poison. Specifically, Ryan assured the public that the Fed\u2019s bond-buying efforts would ignite runaway inflation and tank the dollar. \u201cThere is nothing more insidious that a country can do to its citizens than debase its currency.\u201d Whoops. Since then, inflation has been remarkably tame. The consumer price index, the official measure of inflation, actually fell .3 percent in November, and is up a mere 1.3 percent in the previous 12 months\u2014far below the historical norm. And the dollar? Far from depreciating, it has been going gangbusters. The trade-weighted dollar index, which measures the strength of our currency against those of our major economic partners and competitors, has soared 15 percent since early 2011 and now stands at a nine-year high.\n\nYou would think that this would occasion a few mea culpas, some rethinking, an admission of poor prognostication. But, alas, it continues.\n\nAs the Bureau of Labor Statistics started pumping out reports that showed the economy adding jobs starting in early 2010, the response was generally to ignore them, or worse. In October, 2012, former General Electric CEO Jack Welch famously tweeted, \u201cUnbelievable jobs numbers...these Chicago guys will do anything..can't debate so change numbers.\u201d In fact, we now know that the September 2012 jobs report was one of a continuing series\u201459 straight months and counting\u2014in which the economy has added jobs. More than 10 million in all, more than recouping all the positions lost in the deep recession.\n\nIn 2011, candidate Mitt Romney claimed that, were he to be elected, the unemployment rate would fall below 6 percent by the end of his first term in 2016. Last month, under Obama, the rate fell to 5.6 percent, the lowest level since June 2008.\n\nNext we were assured, the botched rollout of Obamacare was certain to manage the twin tasks of tanking the economy as a whole and resulting in a massive loss of insurance. In March 2014, House Speaker John Boehner noted \u201cthere are less people today with health insurance than there were before this law went into effect.\u201d In fact, as countless studies and the continuing series of Gallup polls have shown, the percentage of people without health insurance has declined dramatically\u2014from 18 percent in the third quarter of 2013, to 12.9 percent in the final quarter of 2014, a decline of nearly 30 percent. Oh, and in the year since Obamacare formally launched, the U.S. economy has posted solid growth while adding 2.95 million jobs\u2014the best such performance since 1999.\n\nLook. The recovery is nowhere near complete\u2014there are still too many people who want and need jobs but can\u2019t find them. And wages remain stagnant. But the larger narrative that has played out in front of our eyes has defied the one predicted by Republican establishment economists and economic thinkers, and vindicated those who argued America was coming back (like me). The stock market is booming, not tanking; interest rates are muted, not out of control; the deficit is shrinking, not expanding; the economy is adding lots of jobs, not shedding them; the dollar is robust, not weak; inflation is nonexistent, not out of control; energy prices have plummeted, not soared; millions of people have gained health insurance, not lost it.\n\nVirtually everything GOP critics have told us would follow from the policies put in place has not come to pass. You would think that this would occasion a few mea culpas, some rethinking, an admission of poor prognostication. But, alas, it continues. Rep. Paul Ryan is now warning in a column that Obamacare \u201cis weighing down our economy and discouraging hiring\u201d and will ultimately \u201ccollapse under its own weight.\u201d\n\nI shouldn\u2019t say nothing has changed. Efforts to deny economic gains have been increasingly difficult to carry off the longer the expansion continues. And so we\u2019re now seeing a slight shift in narrative. Rather than argue that the economy and everything associated with it is in the crapper, Republicans are conceding that things might be looking up. But it\u2019s only because the GOP won control of the House and Senate in November. \u201cAfter so many years of sluggish growth, we\u2019re finally starting to see some economic data that can provide a glimmer of hope,\u201d Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week. \u201cthe uptick appears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama Administration\u2019s long tenure in Washington: the expectation of a new Republican Congress.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:13.248+0000"}
{"entityId": 1756, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Conservatives and liberals both assume that the president will eventually halt the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants through an executive order. They\u2019re wrong.\n\nOn Saturday, the White House announced that President Barack Obama would delay any action on immigration reform until after the November election. The Daily Beast's Ruben Navarrette Jr. predicted just this earlier this week. Here is his original column. To see what challenges face would-be immigrants to the United States, check out Caitlin Dickson's article, \"An Immigrant's Journey.\"\n\n\n\nFor the last several weeks, in Washington and the nation\u2019s immigrant communities, the assumption was that President Obama would circumvent Congress and use his executive power to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation by offering them temporary legal status.\n\n\n\nThe assumption was wrong. As I\u2019ve maintained for months, this rumored plan to overhaul the immigration system through an executive order is not going to materialize. Not after the November elections, and not at any point during this administration.\n\nThe details of exactly what Obama would do and how many people stood to get legal status were unsettled. But the message was clear: Obama was finally ready to keep a promise made long ago to deliver immigration reform\u2014and primed to go it alone. The president said as much in late June, when he declared his frustration with congressional inaction on the issue and vowed to do whatever he could to fix the problem.\n\nBoth the left and the right pushed the idea that Obama would go around Congress and issue an executive order\u2014albeit for different reasons.\n\nThe constituency most clamoring for executive action has already shown they expect little and will settle for nothing. Latinos have proven they\u2019re a cheap date for Democrats, and willing to be fooled by Obama.\n\nOn the left, immigration advocates, aided by the liberal print and broadcast media, wanted to believe the president would take action because they still hoped that Obama could be a champion for progressive causes, and because executive action would show up Republicans in Congress who had refused to take up the immigration bill passed last year by the Senate.\n\nOn the right, immigration restrictionists, with a helping hand from conservative talk radio, pushed the line that what they called \u201camnesty\u201d was on the way because it played into the larger narrative that the federal government was overriding the will of the people. This helped rally the troops and raise funds for anti-immigration organizations.\n\nThere have been dozens of stories in the last few weeks suggesting that some sort of executive relief for the undocumented was just around the corner.\n\nAn August 9 editorial in The New York Times, titled \u201cMr. Obama, Your Move,\u201d suggested that some kind of executive action was a done deal and then offered the president a roadmap: \u201cThe most obvious thing is to lift the threat of deportation from immigrants who should be the lowest priority for removal: those with citizen children, jobs, clean records and strong community ties. Some reports put the size of that group at four million to five million.\u201d\n\nNow, just a few weeks later, there is no need for roadmaps. The President and White House officials are signaling that any executive action will have to wait until after the November elections.\n\nAnd wait, and wait. Here are seven reasons why we shouldn\u2019t expect Obama to \u201cgo it alone\u201d on immigration before or after Election Day:\n\n\u2014 THE BACKLASH. Those who root for executive action by Obama always seem to forget the downside: the potential for ballot box retribution toward Democrats, including vulnerable Senate Democrats. According to the polls, many Americans are still uncomfortable with the idea of rewarding lawbreakers by letting them stay in the U.S. legally. If Obama legalizes millions of people this close to November, it\u2019ll turn Election 2014 on its head and could flip the Senate to Republican hands. You can bet that Obama doesn\u2019t want that on his head.\n\n\n\n\u2014 THERE IS NO POLITICAL BENEFIT. The constituency most clamoring for executive action has already shown they expect little and will settle for nothing. Latinos have proven they\u2019re a cheap date for Democrats, and willing to be fooled by Obama. In 2012, after he had already broken his promise to make immigration reform a top priority and deported 1.5 million people, Latino voters still gave him 70 percent of their votes. What\u2019s the incentive to stick your neck out to please a group that is so easily pleased with nothing?\n\n\u2014 LATINOS ARE DIVIDED. Obama may have already figured out that even Latinos aren't of one mind on immigration reform. Cuban-Americans, Dominicans, and Puerto Ricans don\u2019t care much about it; Mexicans and Mexican-Americans do. Many Mexicans aren\u2019t citizens and can\u2019t vote, and Mexican-Americans are divided\u2014again. Some consider immigration reform a deal breaker for supporting Obama and Democrats, others don\u2019t.\n\n\u2014 OBAMA IS A RESTRICTIONIST AT HEART. Democrats are split. Some support immigration reform because it would help immigrants, while others oppose it because they think flooding the job market with millions of able-bodied workers who work cheap would hurt American laborers. Obama is in the second camp. In 2008, in Los Angeles, during a debate with Hillary Clinton, Obama framed the problem as one in which employers exploit the system by hiring illegal immigrants and thus lower wages for U.S. workers. Now, as president, he is not interested in legalizing the undocumented and creating more competition for U.S. workers.\n\n\u2014 OBAMA\u2019S RELATIONSHIP WITH AFRICAN-AMERICANS WOULD SUFFER. Parts of Obama\u2019s most loyal constituency are not pleased with the fact that the president didn\u2019t go to Ferguson, Missouri, during the protests. And they\u2019re furious that Obama asked Congress for $3.7 billion in aid to care for thousands of unaccompanied minors from Central America but hasn\u2019t done the same on behalf of those who live in predominantly black areas that are suffering. If Obama adds to the misery by offering legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants, many of whom will then compete with African-American workers for scarce jobs, the relationship will be permanently damaged.\n\n\u2014 OBAMA HAS NEVER CARED ABOUT IMMIGRATION REFORM. Obama's record in the Illinois State Senate was woefully thin when it came to advancing issues of concern to Latinos including immigration. United Farm Workers co-founder Dolores Huerta said so when, in 2008, she famously called out Obama as a \u201cJohnny come lately\u201d to Latino concerns. On immigration, as a freshman senator in 2006, Obama helped defeat an immigration compromise bill by authoring \u201cpoison pill\u201d amendments intended to kill the bill by peeling off Republican support. While running for president, he promised Latinos that he would make immigration reform a top priority and later broke that promise. Obama cared about health care reform, and it got done. He doesn\u2019t feel the same way about immigration.\n\n\u2014 AN ABOUT-FACE ON USING EXECUTIVE POWER WOULD BE CLUMSY. As early as spring 2010, Obama met with \u201cstakeholders\u201d at the White House who pressured him to stop deportations and give legal status to DREAMers. Obama resisted that call for nearly five years, insisting that he didn\u2019t have the authority under the Constitution. Repeatedly, he insisted that he wasn\u2019t \u201ca king\u201d and that Congress must act. Now, if Obama changes course and does the very thing that he has been insisting he doesn\u2019t have the power to do, it\u2019ll be awkward and problematic. The smart move is to do what he has been doing for his entire presidency and continue to kick this can down the road.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Obama is going to do. The November elections will come and go, and there will be another set of excuses for why the president can\u2019t use executive power to improve the lives of millions of people. Then another.\n\nImmigration reformers like to say that the price of doing nothing to fix the system is high. But, for this president, the price of doing something is even higher.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:13.519+0000"}
{"entityId": 1757, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "OK, we\u2019ve had no crazy Todd Akin-style comments this cycle. But the Texas law that will close abortion clinics is more revealing.\n\nSometimes, women have sex. Sometimes, that sex is unprotected. Sometimes, women get pregnant. And sometimes, they chose to terminate their pregnancies by having abortions. In fact, one in three American women will have an abortion by the age of 45. These are all basic and undeniable facts of life, facts just like evolution and climate change and the economic benefits of raising the minimum wage that both universal truth and voter opinion plainly endorse. And then there\u2019s the Republican Party, determined to face these facts in the same way it faces its inevitable substantive and demographic irrelevance \u2014 in other words, not at all.\n\nAccording to a recent poll conducted by NARAL Pro-Choice America, almost 7 in 10 Americans \u201cbelieve having an abortion is morally acceptable and should be legal\u201d or are \u201cpersonally against abortion\u201d but \u201cdon\u2019t believe government should prevent a woman from making that decision for herself.\u201d Included in that number are fully 53 percent of Republicans who say they don\u2019t support government limits on abortion.\n\nThe Republican Party has a major \u2014 and growing \u2014 problem not only wooing women voters but also male voters who support women\u2019s reproductive freedom, let alone economic equality. And yet confronted with facts, including that Republicans in Texas are forcing the closure of the majority of the state\u2019s abortion clinics, what does Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican Party, do? Distract from the facts.\n\nOn Meet The Press this past Sunday, Chuck Todd asked Priebus about last week\u2019s ruling by the Fifth Circuit Court to allow Texas\u2019 restrictive anti-abortion law to take immediate effect. Here\u2019s their exchange via RH Reality Check\u2019s Jodi Jacobson, who has characterized Priebus\u2019 response as a downright lie:\n\nTODD: A court upheld a new law in Texas. One of the things about the Republican Party is you don\u2019t like a lot of regulation on businesses, except if the business is [an] abortion clinic. Eighty percent of these abortion clinics in Texas are going to be basically out of business because of this new law. Too much regulation, is that fair? Why regulate on the abortion issue now until maybe the law is\u2014and maybe wait until you win a fight in the Supreme Court where you outlaw abortion altogether. Why restrict a business now in the state of Texas?\n\nREINCE PRIEBUS: Well, you obviously have to talk to someone in Texas. But the fact of the matter is that we believe that any woman that\u2019s faced with an unplanned pregnancy deserves compassion, respect, counseling, whatever it is that we can offer to be\u2014\n\nCHUCK TODD: But 80 percent of those clinics are gone. So that they have to drive 200 or 300 miles for that compassion?\n\nREINCE PRIEBUS: No, look, listen, Chuck. The issue for us is only one thing. And that\u2019s whether you ought to use taxpayer money to fund abortion. That\u2019s the one issue that I think separates this conversation that we\u2019re having.\n\nWait a second! The Texas law has absolutely nothing to do with taxpayer dollars \u2014 after all, Texas banned public support for reproductive health a long time ago. No, the Texas law merely places extremely onerous and unnecessary requirements on abortion providers for the sole purpose of forcing those providers to stop performing abortions. Which, by the way, is working \u2014 as a result of the Fifth Circuit ruling, seven or eight additional clinics in Texas will close, forcing women in many parts of the state to drive 300 miles or more to exercise their constitutional right to an abortion. The Texas policy, after all, is the manifestation of GOP-led attacks on abortion across the country, which have gone to such an extreme that 87 percent of counties in America do not have abortion providers and medical training on abortion care has been so undermined that, as The Daily Beast reported, a new online course is trying to fill the gap.\n\nAgain and again, it seems to boil down to Republicans being offended that women \u2014 especially poor women \u2014 even want to have sex.\n\nMaybe Priebus was confused. Republicans also oppose government funding for contraception \u2014 or even, in the case of Obamacare, government requiring private insurers to cover contraception \u2014 despite the obvious fact that affordable access to contraception lowers the rate of unintended pregnancies and thus the need for abortions. Then again, I give Priebus more credit than that \u2014 and assume that his words weren\u2019t accidentally misspoken but deliberately misleading.\n\nAgain and again, as I have written, it seems to boil down to Republicans being offended that women \u2014 especially poor women \u2014 even want to have sex. How dare they! Soon they\u2019ll be wanting equal pay. \u201cYou could argue that money is more important for men,\u201d Republican congressional candidate Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin once said, explaining his opposition to equal pay laws. Birth control is for women who \u201ccannot control their libido,\u201d said former Arkansas Governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee.\n\nThese attitudes, along with backwards policy stances, paint a picture of a GOP not only out of touch with women\u2019s reproductive and economic freedom but downright opposed to it. Is it any wonder that women, especially young liberated women, are fleeing from a party that is so profoundly and anachronistically condescending to more than half of the population?\n\nRank-and-file conservatives by and large do not share these extreme anti-equality, anti-abortion, anti-women attitudes. But such views are becoming dangerously prevalent among Republican leaders and candidates \u2014 and being translated into policy at a record pace, with results so frightening that Republican leaders realize they can\u2019t even be honest with voters about the effects. In other words, the \u201cRepublican War on Women\u201d isn\u2019t a politically convenient construction of the Democrats, it\u2019s a fact \u2014 one that voters are certainly aware of.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:14.053+0000"}

Paul Ryan now has a \u201cdiscussion draft\u201d with the key ideas he thinks can help the poorest Americans get ahead, and where the federal government has a role.\n\n\u201cEnough with politics, let\u2019s talk solutions,\u201d he declared, presenting a set of policy reforms that could serve as a governing agenda should the Republicans gain the majority in the U.S. Senate in November. Ryan\u2019s plan may also be a road map for Republican presidential candidates in 2016 as they seek to present themselves as a party that does care about the least among us.\n\n\u201cHe knows that great leaders fight for everyone no matter how they vote,\u201d AEI president Arthur Brooks said when introducing Ryan to an audience Thursday morning packed with fresh-faced interns in Washington for the summer.\n\nRyan is calling for a pilot program of \u201cOpportunity Grants\u201d that would consolidate 11 federal programs into one stream of funding to states. Food stamps, cash welfare payments, housing assistance and a host of other benefits would be packaged together, and a state that chooses to participate would get the same amount of money, but would have flexibility in choosing how it is allocated.\n\nAEI\u2019s Robert Doar, moderating a panel immediately after Ryan\u2019s talk, raised a red light about food stamps being part of the package. The long standing program has become a lightning rod on Capitol Hill, and any attempts to let states tamper with allocating food stamp money is likely to be fiercely resisted by Democrats. But giving states more flexibility to tailor benefits to individual needs is a central part of Ryan\u2019s reform agenda.\n\nTwo other scholars, Ron Haskins from Brookings and Stuart Butler with Heritage, used the term \u201cblock grants\u201d interchangeably with Ryan\u2019s opportunity grants. Block grants have long been a cherished GOP idea, and Ryan insisted that what he\u2019s offering is different from \u201ca garden variety block grant where you cut a check and call it a day.\u201d He envisions local groups working on the front lines, from Catholic Charities to America Works, delivering customized services with a neutral third party evaluating results.\n\n\u201cCriminal justice reform is on Ryan\u2019s list, and it has strong backing from the left and the right.\u201d\n\nRobert Woodson with the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, who Ryan identified as his mentor, said not everyone is poor for the same reason. While the left sees \u201ca sea of victims\u201d the right sees \u201ca sea of aliens.\u201d Everyone is redeemable, he says, it just takes different strategies. \u201cEighty percent of my best friends are ex-something or other and these are people I have taken Paul around the country to see,\u201d he said. People rebuilding their lives after prison are \u201cthe healing agents, the antibodies,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Ryan\u2019s opportunity grants are likely to generate the most controversy, he included several other ideas that have great potential for bipartisan support. He would increase the Earned Income Tax Credit, a program first introduced by President Reagan, to better cover childless adults, a reform similar to what President Obama proposes. Ryan would expand access to education, break up the \u201ccollege cartels,\u201d and reform accreditation. \u201cSounds dry, but it\u2019s a huge difference,\u201d he said.\n\nCriminal justice reform is on Ryan\u2019s list, and it has strong backing from the left and the right. \u201cGive people a chance to earn a second chance,\u201d Ryan said, citing bipartisan legislation sponsored by Republicans Mike Lee and Raul Labrador and Democrat Bobby Scott. Their bill would give judges more discretion in sentencing first time, nonviolent offenders.\n\nFinally, there is regulatory reform, which is a surprisingly minor piece of the Ryan package considering how strongly Republicans oppose government regulations. If a regulation would create an undue burden on low-income families, a federal agency would be required to get congressional approval. Ryan did not go into detail on what an \u201cundue burden\u201d would be.\n\nRon Haskins from Brookings paid Ryan the ultimate compliment, calling his proposal \u201cworthy of a think tank.\u201d Almost everything in it has potential for bipartisan support, he enthused. \u201cIf we take the Senate, we can put something on the president\u2019s desk.\u201d Haskins is affiliated with the liberal Brookings Institution, but he worked on poverty issues in the Bush White House.

On his Facebook page on Monday, Donnelly accused his primary opponent, Neel Kashkari, a former investment banker, of helping conspire to bring Sharia law to the United States\u2014because when Kashkari was interim assistant treasury secretary for financial stability in 2008, he participated in a Treasury conference about Islamic finances. Kashkari called Donnelly\u2019s post \u201cabsurd,\u201d while California state GOP Vice Chairwoman Harmeet Dhillon called the allegations \u201ctroubling and irresponsible.\u201d On Wednesday, the Alameda County Republican Party accused Donnelly and his supporters of using \u201cbigotry, racism and outright ignorance to try to win the primary.\u201d Donnelly later apologized.\n\nBachmann Opposes Women\u2019s History Museum\n\nRep.

Although Bachmann is honored in the museum\u2019s online exhibit \u201cProfiles in Motherhood\u201d for her adoption of 23 foster children, she said she is concerned that the website shows \u201coverwhelming bias\u201d toward women who embrace \u201cliberal ideology, radical feminism.\u201d The legislation to fund the museum \u201clacks the necessary safeguards to ensure the proposed museum will not become an ideological shrine to abortion that will eventually receive federal funding and a prominent spot on the National Mall,\u201d Bachmann said on the House floor. \u201cA no vote on the current legislation, which I advocate for, very simply, is a vote to stand up for the pro-life movement, a vote to stand up for traditional marriage, and a vote to stand up for the traditional family.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:14.756+0000"}
{"entityId": 1760, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Informed precisely by his Jewishness, Stewart made Palestinians into human beings. Hard to picture Noah being nearly as effective.\n\nI\u2019m sure that Trevor Noah, the 31-year-old South African comedian tapped to be the new host of The Daily Show after Jon Stewart retires this fall, was expecting to be compared to Stewart from a comedic point of view. I\u2019m sure he knew that he would hear how no one could fill Stewart\u2019s shows, etc. And perhaps he even expected the criticism over his past tweets that have led some to label him as misogynist or anti-Semitic or racially insensitive. That comes with the turf of this type of high-profile gig.\n\nWhat I doubt Noah could\u2019ve expected was that he would be pulled into the Palestinian-Israeli conflict within hours of Comedy Central naming as the new host. Even I was a bit surprised, but frankly I should have expected it.\n\nWe saw the conservative Daily Caller run a story titled \u201dIs New \u2018Daily Show\u2019 Host Trevor Noah Anti-Israel?\u201d The entire basis for the article was a 2010 comedic tweet by Noah: \u201cSouth Africans know how to recycle like Israel knows how to be peaceful.\u201d\n\nApparently to The Daily Caller, these 71 characters (including spaces) expose Noah\u2019s view that Israel \u201cis an inherently belligerent country.\u201d The article also went on to slam Jon Stewart for being anti-Israel because he had the audacity to mock certain policies of the Netanyahu administration. Of course, The Daily Caller slams the Obama administration\u2019s policies hourly; so does that make it anti-American?\n\nThe Jewish Forward, a progressive publication, took a much more nuanced approach asking, \u201dWhat Does Trevor Noah Think About Israel?\u201d It quoted tweets from liberal Jews who expressed concerns over the loss of Stewart and wondered what Noah\u2019s views would be on the Middle East conflict.\n\nHow often does a comedian taking a new gig have to pass a litmus test on support of Israel like a United States politician? But The Daily Show is no ordinary comedy show given that Stewart had so often spoke about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in a way that resulted in cheers from the left and slams from the right.\n\nOf course, The Daily Caller slams the Obama administration's policies hourly; so does that make it anti-American?\n\nBut I think something else needs to be raised when it comes to Noah. He is South African and was raised during the final years of apartheid. I have no doubt that the Netanyahu-type Israel supporters know full well what that could mean.\n\nNoah has heard South African leaders like Nelson Mandela offer pro-Palestinian statements over the years such as \u201cSouth Africans would not feel free until Palestinians were free.\u201d Desmond Tutu has long been a critic of Israeli government policies toward the Palestinians. Noah is even probably aware that the United Nations passed a resolution in 1983 decrying Israel\u2019s conservative government headed by Menachem Begin for violating the worldwide boycott of South Africa\u2019s apartheid government by supplying it with support in \u201cthe military and nuclear fields.\u201d\n\nSo I get why the right-wing Israeli supports might have cause for concern. On the other hand, I understand why some progressives are in a tizzy over the loss of Stewart. He not only called out the Netanyahu administration in a way we had almost never seen before in the U.S. media, more importantly, Stewart talked about Palestinians in human terms.\n\nI wrote about this very issue during last summer\u2019s Gaza war in an article titled \u201cHow Jon Stewart made it okay to care about Palestinian suffering.\u201d I had never seen a comedic host, or almost any host in the U.S. media for that matter, discuss the suffering of the Palestinian people with such empathy. For example, Stewart criticized the 2009 Gaza war that left 700 Palestinians civilians dead, calling it a \u201ccivilian carnage Toyotathon.\u201d\n\nDuring that war, Stewart also mocked the conservative talking point that Palestinians in Gaza could just leave if they wanted to avoid being killed by the IDF\u2019s bombs: \u201cEvacuate to where?! Have you fucking seen Gaza? Israel blocked this border, Egypt blocked this border. What, are you supposed to swim for it?\u201d\n\n\n\nStewart also made it clear that criticizing the policies of the Netanyahu administration was not anti-Semitic. After all, Stewart is proudly Jewish.\n\nConsequently, Stewart gave many guests leeway to discuss the conflict in a way that we had never publicly engaged in before. And in my mind, Stewart at least contributed to the views we see of Netanyahu that are split along partisan and ideological grounds. For example, a poll released a few weeks ago found that only 17 percent of Democrats hold a favorable view of Netanyahu.\n\nAnd a new poll released yesterday finds that 58 percent of liberals support the establishment of a Palestinian State while only 30 percent of conservatives feel the same. I can\u2019t discount the influence Stewart may have had on some liberals to see Palestinians as deserving of self-determination thanks to his framing of them in terms of their humanity.\n\nBut here\u2019 s the thing both conservatives and my fellow progressives need to come to terms with: The Daily Show will never be The Daily Show once Stewart leaves. I don\u2019t mean Noah will not be funny or successful. It\u2019s just that on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Stewart\u2019s comedic views became part of the mainstream media\u2019s discussion of the issue because of who he was.\n\nAnd I have to go back again to Stewart being proudly Jewish. His criticism of Netanyahu\u2019s policies or his recognition of the Palestinians as human beings deserving of concern was at least infused by his Judaism. It gave his words more weight.\n\nI\u2019m sure Noah will do material about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict too And when he does, he will be cheered and jeered like Stewart. But I doubt it will be nearly as influential or inspiring. And for that reason, I will always long for the days where Stewart held court four nights a week at 11:00 PM.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:14.899+0000"}
{"entityId": 1761, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Michael Eric Dyson is on the money: There\u2019s a new model now of black intellectual leadership, and West is yesterday\u2019s news.\n\nMichael Eric Dyson\u2019s blistering takedown of Cornel West in The Ghost of Cornel West for The New Republic not only closed the door on a decades-long friendship that arguably led the way in black American thought at the end of the 20th century, but also displayed how the roles of black leaders have evolved during Barack Obama\u2019s rise to prominence.\n\nDyson starts off by describing West\u2019s animus toward the president as a love that has turned into a hatred so severe that it would make the heavens shudder. He mentions the times when West called Obama a \u201cRockefeller Republican in blackface,\u201d on Democracy Now! and a \u201cbrown-faced Clinton\u201d in Salon magazine. He discusses a moment when West told him, Dyson, that he does not \u201crespect the brother at all,\u201d referring to Obama. All this in the first two paragraphs.\n\nAs the piece winds its way to the conclusion that solidifies the end of their personal and professional relationship, a narrative of West emerges as a man of supreme intellect who thought that he had reached the pinnacle of African-American thought. West had even gone so far as to start referring to himself as a prophet. He believed that he was the voice that the black community would run to when in need of clarity. Dyson was one of those voices early on, so West\u2019s fall from grace in his eyes is all the more striking. He was a self-anointed prophet, who has publicly lost one of his most significant disciples and a friend.\n\nApparently, it was the release of Race Matters in the mid-\u201990s that placed West at the pinnacle, and he intended on staying there for life. He did not need to publish new, thought-provoking works. His lack of output was disappointing, and so were his verbal attacks toward others in the black community, especially at MSNBC contributor and professor Melissa Harris-Perry.\n\nStill, he potentially could have recovered from both of these errors. Yet he decided to rest on his laurels from here to eternity, and as he did so, time, unbeknownst to him, began passing him by. When Obama showed up, and politely challenged West\u2019s idyllic place at the summit, West responded venomously to challenge this young, brash usurper.\n\nWest became incredulous when Obama chose to speak in front of the people who elected him instead of those within the black community.\n\nWest was not the only person to challenge Obama\u2019s place within the black community\u2014Jesse Jackson had very choice words for Obama, too\u2014but he is one of the few whose perspective has not evolved with the passage of time, and nothing could be more damning for an intellectual. Yet the key thing to remember is that Obama did not take West\u2019s position at the summit; he instead built a taller mountain and sat atop it.\n\nThis recent evolution of black leadership in American society always makes me think about a conversation I had with my grandfather on the eve of the 2008 Iowa caucuses.\n\nDuring the conversation, he explained to me that he intended on voting for Hillary Clinton for president because he did not believe that white people would allow Obama to become president of the United States. My grandfather was an educated man, a minister, and a veteran of the Korean War, but mentally it was absolutely impossible for him to believe that Obama could become the next president.\n\nI did not agree with his perspective, but I knew where it came from, and it made me wonder more and more about how one\u2019s environment and experiences can drastically shape what you can believe is possible in the world.\n\nMost times when I tell this story, I need to follow it up with a simplifying analogy to explain how this perspective could have come into being. In this analogy, I condense America to a k-through-12 school.\n\nAt the beginning of America, blacks were unpaid laborers at the school. Then we became paid laborers, and then we were able to have our own classes, and through this structure, influential black teachers were able to emerge. These teachers made progress within the school and created lasting changes, but the goal was always to become one of these beloved teachers and to make change through this medium. Many of the most influential black leaders in America were teachers or educated through the church. W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington were both teachers. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X taught from the pulpit. Dyson and West used both media, the classroom and the pulpit.\n\nObama, on the other hand, specialized in neither, even though he taught at the University of Chicago. Instead he took the administrative route. He wanted to be the principal of the school, and that meant he could not teach full time, and this is where the conflict has largely emerged.\n\nPeople like my grandfather did not believe that it would be possible to have a black principal. Many within the African-American community wanted to know if Obama would be able to teach class full time, because in their minds teaching was what black Americans had always done; and when he said that he could not, they questioned his motives and integrity.\n\nWhen Obama won the presidency the opportunities for black thought and leadership expanded. My grandfather was beside himself with joy that night because he had lived to witness the previously thought impossible. What he thought was possible in the world had now expanded. Innumerable black Americans felt the same. A new level of attainment in public life was now possible.\n\nYet despite this progress, the need remained for great black teachers, and now a new question emerged: How would the teachers themselves handle no longer being arguably the most influential voice in the Obama era?\n\nDyson and other black leaders have taken a healthy position of comfortably and even vehemently disagreeing with Obama on policy issues, but respecting the man for the position he has earned and what it has done for the black community.\n\nWest clearly did not take this change well and instead opted to sternly rebuff this paradigm shift that undermined his influence.\n\nDyson details West\u2019s anger when Obama did not give him tickets to the inauguration, and he mentions how West \u201clambasted\u201d Obama when the then-junior senator from Illinois decided to announce his candidacy for the presidency in Illinois instead of at Tavis Smiley\u2019s State of the Black Union meeting in Virginia.\n\nWest wanted Obama to visit his class, and he became incredulous when the candidate chose to speak in front of the people who elected him instead of those within the black community. West either did not see the shift or chose to ignore it.\n\nWhen West did not receive inauguration tickets his fury was that of someone who did not understand that the party could go on without him.\n\nHe wanted everyone to love him for his brilliance, and forgot to use his intellect for the benefit of others. He stopped being a teacher, refused to be a student, and wanted to be a prophet.\n\nThe leadership roles that black Americans can obtain has changed in the last decade and this has required an evolution of thought amongst black intellectuals and leaders, and a re-examining of roles within the black community.\n\nWest was once both an intellectual and a leader, but as the times changed, he did not. And now progress, thought, and leadership have moved forward without him.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:15.045+0000"}

Now he\u2019s trying to \u201cfix\u201d what he broke.\n\nGovernor Mike Pence promised Tuesday to \u201cfix\u201d a controversial law with anti-gay undertones in an attempt to stop the constant hammering the state has received since he signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law last week.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe for a minute that it was the intention of the general assembly to create a license to discriminate or right to deny services to gays, lesbians or anyone else in the state, and it certainly wasn\u2019t my intent, but I can appreciate that has become the perception,\u201d Pence said.\n\nBut advocates for changes to the law said if Pence didn\u2019t know this would turn into a public-relations dumpster fire, he was either willfully ignorant or simply didn\u2019t care.\n\nGay-rights advocates said they flagged the problem with the lack of protective language early in the process and pushed minor amendments to the bill, they say, would have largely resolved the issue.\n\nIt is unclear whether Pence himself knew about the amendments, but two people familiar with the lobbying effort behind the measures pro-LGBT measures said it was clear very early in the process that the governor did not want any changes to the bill.\n\n\u201cPence and his party insisted that the bill not be balanced,\u201d said Indiana Representative Ed Delaney, a Democrat and the author of an amendment that would have added the sentence \u201cthe protection of civil rights; or the prevention of discrimination; is a compelling government interest\u201d to the bill.\n\nPence\u2019s retreat\u2014just Sunday he said the law would not be changed\u2014signified that Indiana\u2019s culture warrior had, once again, bit off more than he could chew.\n\nDelaney said Pence\u2019s office either didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care about the amendments.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s created this problem,\u201d Delaney said.\n\nAnother amendment would have exempted civil rights laws from RFRA\u2014a change modeled after similar laws in Missouri and Texas. (Indiana\u2019s civil rights laws do not protect LGBT individuals\u2014but several local municipalities, like Indianapolis, have laws on the books that extend civil rights protections to the LGBT community).\n\nBoth amendments were rejected by the Republican-led Indiana legislature.\n\nPence\u2019s retreat\u2014just Sunday he said the law would not be changed\u2014signified that Indiana\u2019s culture warrior had, once again, bit off more than he could chew.\n\nAs the uproar started, Pence staff thought the issue would fade, according to a source last week familiar with a conversation between Pence and his aides. So while Pence expressed surprise at the vitriol created by the law, LGBT advocates said he should have seen it coming.\n\n\u201cThere is no surprise in this,\u201d Dale Carpenter, a constitutional and civil liberties law professor at the University of Minnesota Law School.\n\n\u201cThey chose to reject those changes in the committee and again on the House floor that suggests to be the legislative intent here is to allow religious freedom to impact anti-discrimination laws,\u201d said Tyler Deaton, senior advisor at American Unity Fund, a pro-gay conservative group.\n\nPence insisted in an uncharacteristically defensive interview on This Week last Sunday the bill was about religious liberty, not discrimination.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been shameless rhetoric about my state and about this law and about its intention all over the Internet,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are trying to make it about one particular issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cShameless rhetoric\u201d aside, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of Pence\u2019s explanation, starting with the actual signing of the bill.\n\nAnd it had everything to do with the \u201cparticular issue.\u201d\n\nIn a photo of the private signing ceremony, Pence is surrounded by a small group of people\u2014including the three wise men of the anti-gay marriage movement of Indiana: Micah Clark, executive director of the American Family Association of Indiana; Curt Smith, president of the Indiana Family Institute; and Eric Miller, executive director of Advance America.\n\nDelaney said the presence of those individuals at the signing ceremony spoke volumes about the intent of the law.\n\n\u201cIs Mike Pence the only person who hasn\u2019t read their press releases?\u201d Delaney asked. \u201cHe knows what they wanted to do.\u201d\n\nPence, himself, has a long, proud record of opposing gay rights during his tenure in Congress.\n\nIt also isn\u2019t the first time he carried it into the governor\u2019s mansion, where it has had some pretty embarrassing results.\n\nA push for a constitutional ban on gay marriage in Indiana ended in failure but only after the Pence team tried to censor the opposition.\n\nWhen gay-marriage proponents posted their displeasure with the measure on Facebook, Pence\u2019s staff simply deleted the messages.\n\nInitially, Pence and his staff said they just deleted comments that were obscene\u2014 but later fessed up to removing only the comments that disagreed with the governor\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cOn careful review, it appears that this was not always the case and some comments were being deleted simply because they expressed disagreement with my position. I regret that this occurred and sincerely apologize to all those who were affected,\u201d Pence wrote in a Facebook post at the time.\n\nAdding insult to injury the measure failed, giving Pence a black eye just a year into his governorship.\n\nThis is a slightly different response than Pence was used to during his time in Washington.\n\nAs a member of Congress he had no problem opposing rights for the LGBT community.\n\nHe voted for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage and against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would have added LGBT as a protected group on the federal level from discrimination in the workplace.\n\nWhen the federal amendment to ban gay marriage failed to pass the House in 2006, Pence proclaimed it a \u201csuccessful failure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe poured a little more concrete in the footings of a building that will be built,\u201d Pence said at the time, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHe was lauded as a hero by the right for his positions on social issues\u2014receiving multiple \u201cTrue Blue\u201d awards from the Family Research Council for \u201chis commitment to the family and sanctity of human life.\u201d\n\nThe Indiana Family Institute, which was instrumental in crafting the RFRA bill, has likewise awarded him the \u201cFriend of the Family Award.\u201d\n\nBut being a culture warrior as governor, as he has found out, has higher stakes.\n\n\u201cHe could afford to be a culture warrior because it wasn\u2019t impacting an entire state\u2019s economy,\u201d Deaton said, referring to the burgeoning \u201cboycott Indiana\u201d campaign. \u201cAnd now he has a different burden on his shoulders and this is turning out to cost the state tens of millions of dollars on the bottom line, thousands of jobs.

{"entityId": 1763, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Suffice it to say the Wisconsin governor and 2016 hopeful has a hard time explaining his views on the subject.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say LGBT issues are not Scott Walker\u2019s favorite conversation topic.\n\nQuestions about various aspects of the gay-rights debate have frequently tripped him up on the campaign trail\u2014most recently during an interview on CNN when he was asked whether being gay was a choice.\n\n\u201cOh, I mean, I think that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s not even an issue for me to be involved in,\u201d the Wisconsin governor said. \u201cThe bottom line is, I\u2019m going to stand up and work hard for every American, regardless of who they are, no matter where they come from, no matter what their background, I\u2019m going to fight for people, whether they vote for me or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo act on behalf of people is, to do that properly, you have to understand or at least have an opinion on who they are and where they\u2019re coming from,\u201d reporter Dana Bash replied.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an opinion on every single issue out there,\u201d Walker continued. \u201cI mean, to me, that\u2019s, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Walker answered. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that question.\u201d\n\nThe born-gay question wasn\u2019t the only issue putting the governor in a bit of a quandary; his much-chronicled comments on whether or not the Boy Scouts should let gay men serve as scoutmasters created a bit of a hullabaloo. The governor initially told IJReview that he supported the exclusionary policy \u201cbecause it protected children and advanced scout values.\u201d\n\nHis campaign team promptly walked that back , countering the implication that gay men put Boy Scouts in danger.\n\n\u201cThe previous policy protected Scouts from the rancorous political debate over policy issues and culture wars,\u201d said campaign spokeswoman Ashlee Strong. \u201cScouts should not be used as a political football on issues that can often be heated and divisive.\u201d\n\nWalker also has given curious answers to questions about attending a gay wedding. His son Alex was a witness at the wedding of his wife\u2019s cousin to her same-sex partner; Walker went to the reception.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been to a wedding,\u201d he said in April at a press conference in New Hampshire , referring to same-sex ceremonies. \u201cThat\u2019s true even though my position on marriage is still that\u2019s defined between a man and a woman, and I support the Constitution of the state. But for someone I love, we\u2019ve been at a reception.\u201d\n\nWalker may be no better at discussing the issue in private. The Washington Post reported in June that one Republican billionaire hedge fund manager withdrew support for the governor after the two had a long argument about the issue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an opinion on every single issue out there,\u201d Walker said.\n\nAnd the governor also recently suggested that reporters had for weeks been inaccurately describing his wife\u2019s stance on gay marriage.\n\nSo what gives?\n\nRepresentative Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), an openly gay member of Congress who worked with Walker when they were both members of the state Assembly, suggested his confusion might have more to do with his political profile than his position on LGBT rights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to decide if it\u2019s just extreme pandering or unfortunate ignorance,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people quit thinking that way in the \u201960s and \u201970s.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI think the best question that someone should ask him is, \u2018Well, when did you decide to be straight,\u2019 Governor Walker?\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s tone is a significant departure from their days in the Assembly, Pocan said.\n\n\u201cHe never displayed that depth of ignorance when he was in the legis or as governor,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe certainly talked a tough game when it came to issues like marriage equality, but he never put that large of a display of misinformation out there at the time.\u201d\n\nWisconsin social conservatives seem confident that the governor\u2019s equivocation on the question of whether or not people are born gay doesn\u2019t have any bearing on his opposition to same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of issues that presidential candidates are asked about,\u201d said Julaine Appling, who heads the socially conservative group Wisconsin Family Action. \u201cThe governor and I may have some differences of opinion on some of the things, but when it comes down to what he\u2019s done to support the marriage amendment, that it\u2019s specifically between one man and woman in this state, his track record speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nDuring his first gubernatorial campaign, Walker adamantly supported the state legislature\u2019s push to pass a constitutional amendment limiting marriage to one man-one woman couples. That effort was successful and he defended the amendment in court, though its backers ultimately lost.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t his only time fighting same-sex marriage rights. He also consistently opposed efforts to provide benefits to the same-sex partners of state and county employees, as the Human Rights Campaign documents in their Walker dossier .\n\nBut since the state\u2019s marriage amendment lost in court, he\u2019s shown little verve to discuss LGBT issues.\n\nOn Meet the Press in March 2013 , he said young Republican voters \u201cdon\u2019t want to get focused on those issues.\u201d The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported he had an awkward exchange with Wisconsin reporters in June 2014 when he suggested that his view on same-sex marriage rights doesn\u2019t matter and that he didn\u2019t want to talk about it at all.\n\nOn top of that, he told Bloomberg in 2013 that a proper balance of rights for LGBT people would protect them from discrimination in the workplace but also keep them from marrying. That\u2019s how Wisconsin handled gay rights, he said, and that\u2019s the way to do it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had no problems\u2014or I should say, limited problems\u2014with that,\u201d he said, referring to the state\u2019s employment protection law. \u201cAt the same time, we still have a constitutional amendment that defines marriage. There\u2019s a healthy balance there.\u201d\n\nSo Walker\u2019s record on LGBT issues was a little more nuanced than, say, Rick Santorum\u2019s.\n\nBut after the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to wed, Walker came out in favor of amending the U.S. Constitution to give states the right to prohibit such unions. And as for the social conservative leaders he needs to woo in order to do well in Iowa?

I was torn. I have children who are very passionate [in favor of same-sex marriage], and Scott was on his side very passionate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me because I have a cousin who I love dearly\u2014she is like a sister to me\u2014who is married to a woman, her partner of 18 years,\u201d she said.\n\nThat was widely seen as an endorsement of same-sex marriage. Two weeks later, on July 13, ABC News reported that as uncontroversial fact.\n\n\u201cThey were all on one side, Dad on the other,\u201d said host David Muir when talking about the family\u2019s views on the issue.\n\nSo there it was: Scott Walker\u2019s wife backed same-sex marriage. At The Daily Caller, Matt Lewis wrote a column suggesting that this might give some social conservatives pause. And Iowa conservative radio talk show host Steve Deace said the Walker family\u2019s support for same-sex marriage concerned him (\u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d he told The Daily Beast).\n\nBut on Sunday, July 19\u2014two weeks after The Washington Post suggested Tonette favored same-sex marriage\u2014Walker told CBN News\u2019s David Brody that, actually, all those reports were wrong, and she\u2019s actually against letting same-sex couples marry.\n\n\u201cMy wife actually supports my position,\u201d he told Brody during an interview with Brody on his campaign bus. \u201cShe pointed out she was torn by the fact that she\u2019s got me with a position and she\u2019s got others family members in different position, but being emotionally torn doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s got a difference of opinion.\u201d\n\nBut what is that position exactly?

They\u2019ve looked to change how the United States handles incarceration and policing, while rolling back some of the Clinton-era prison policies that led to a spike in the prison population.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve had some significant successes on the state level, notably in Georgia and Texas. Now, they\u2019re aiming for criminal justice reform in Washington.\n\nAnd their efforts looked promising\u2014until Kate\u2019s Law.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of the ugly killing of Kate Steinle.\n\nSteinle was shot and killed by an undocumented immigrant this early summer while on Pier 14, a popular tourist destination in San Francisco. The immigrant had been deported five times but returned to San Francisco, a city that doesn\u2019t cooperate fully with federal immigration enforcement efforts. Steinle\u2019s killing sparked national outrage, and that outrage sparked a call to, well, do something.\n\nWhat resulted is called Kate\u2019s Law, a bill named after the victim, pushed by her parents, and boosted before a massive audience by Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\n\u201cToo many Americans have been victimized by illegal aliens who had previously been deported,\u201d Ted Cruz said. \u201cWe must send the message that defiance of our laws will no longer be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThat bill would require a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years for any undocumented immigrant convicted of illegally re-entering the United States after being deported. Arizona Republican Rep. Matt Salmon introduced the bill in the House, and Sen. Ted Cruz introduced a companion version in the Senate. And that has conservative criminal justice reformers holding their heads in their hands.\n\nMandatory minimum sentence requirements have long been a popular way for politicians to burnish their \u201ctough on crime\u201d reputations. Nobody ever lost an election for being too anti-criminal.\n\nBut in the process, America\u2019s prison population skyrocketed, doing outsize damage to African-American communities\u2014as well as state and federal budgets. Mass incarceration doesn\u2019t come cheap, and that was why conservative legislators in Texas started moved to overhaul the state\u2019s criminal justice system back in 2007\u2014it was getting too expensive to lock up that many people, so they reformed how sentencing worked and changed rules regarding probation and parole. The outcomes there were great: the state saved money, reduced its incarceration levels, and crime went down in the process.\n\nSince then, conservative lawmakers have been trying to go national with some of those reforms. This year could have been their best opportunity yet\u2014President Obama has signalled that he\u2019s interested in the sentencing reform issue, lawmakers in both the House and the Senate have formed bipartisan, pan-ideological coalitions to back a variety of bills, and the Black Lives Matters protests have pushed criminal justice issues into the headlines like never before.\n\nCruz has also been a key player in those efforts, co-sponsoring legislation on the issue and calling for a reexamination to \u201ccurrent draconian mandatory minimum sentences.\u201d He\u2019s even waxed poetic on the issue.\n\n\u201cToday, far too many young men\u2014and in particular African-American young men . . . find themselves subject to sentences of many decades for relatively minor, nonviolent drug infractions,\u201d he said in February, per Rolling Stone. \u201cWe should not live in a world of Les Mis\u00e9rables, where a young man finds his entire future taken away by excessive mandatory minimums.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Kate\u2019s Law, which Cruz has energetically boosted on the presidential campaign trail, could sizably increase the prison population by forcing nonviolent offenders to spend years in prison\u2014and, conservative criminal justice experts say, without having a sizable impact on how many deported immigrants unlawfully return to the United States. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the law would likely send 60,000 more people to federal prison over the next five years. That would increase the federal prison population by 28 percent and would cost about $2 billion per year.\n\nCruz argues the bill is a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cToo many Americans have been victimized by illegal aliens who had previously been deported,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe must send the message that defiance of our laws will no longer be tolerated.\u201d\n\nOthers disagree.\n\n\u201cMandatory minimums don\u2019t deter crime, and they seldom punish only the offenders who inspire legislation like Kate\u2019s Law,\u201d said Molly Gill of Families Against Mandatory Minimums in a statement. \u201cThis bill won\u2019t stop deported immigrants from re-entering the country, but it will force American taxpayers to pay for half a decade\u2019s worth of food, clothing, and housing for people we supposedly don\u2019t want in the country at all.\u201d\n\nOn this issue, Cruz has even lost one of his closest allies. Sen. Mike Lee, a Tea Party favorite from Utah, opposes creating new mandatory minimum sentences and has been \u201ca particular thorn\u201d for its boosters, according to Politico. And other conservative criminal justice advocates have been baffled by Cruz\u2019s stance. One conservative who\u2019s worked extensively on criminal justice issues said he found Cruz\u2019s advocacy for the bill particularly surprising, given the senator\u2019s invocation of Les Miserables to denounce lengthy mandatory minimums. And Pat Nolan, who helms the American Conservative Union Foundation\u2019s Center for Criminal Justice Reform, said Kate\u2019s Law could undermine their efforts to roll back other mandatory minimums.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s a step backwards,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a disconnect\u2014they know that mandatory minimums haven\u2019t worked, they know that they\u2019ve resulted in absurdly long sentences for rather minor players, and so, yeah, it\u2019s like all of the progress that we\u2019ve made in showing policymakers that the mandatory minimums are counterproductive gets swept away in the emotion of the moment.\u201d\n\nNolan added that our country\u2019s experience with mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders would likely predict what kind of results we could expect from similar rules for nonviolent immigration offenders.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of folks who have come back across the border, and they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the idea of having them locked up for five years on the taxpayer\u2019s dime seems like a really extravagant way to deal with it.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, he added, mandatory minimums are notoriously ineffective at actually deterring crime.\n\n\u201cThat presumes that criminals are rational calculators, that they say, \u2018Oh, I was gonna do that, but gee, they raised the penalty, so I\u2019m not going to commit that crime,\u2019\u201d Nolan said. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that works at all. These folks are not rational calculators. They all think they\u2019re smarter than everybody else, and they don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to get caught.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s laughable,\u201d he added, of the efforts to limit drug crimes by hiking sentencing requirements. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t stopped that at all.\u201d\n\nJohn Malcolm, who works on criminal justice issues at the Heritage Foundation, shared Nolan\u2019s skepticism about the effectiveness of mandatory minimums to deter crime.\n\n\u201cDespite the existence of mandatory minimum penalties at the federal level and in many states, replacing drug dealers has not been a very difficult thing for cartel organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce a drug dealer is arrested, there will be three or four there to take their place. If you were looking for evidence of general deterrence in the drug area, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are people in other countries who are desperate to come to our shores,\u201d he added, \u201cand they\u2019re probably willing to risk certain penalties.\u201d\n\nBryan Johnson, an immigration attorney who has represented clients who have illegally reentered the United States after being deported, said these migrants typically return because they\u2019re fleeing danger in their home countries or because they\u2019re seeking to reunited with family here.\n\n\u201cThe fact that someone illegally reenters the United States has no bearing on whether they\u2019re going to, in the future, commit a criminal offense,\u201d he said.\n\nIn short, Kate\u2019s Law would be enormously expensive, and there\u2019s scant evidence it would be worth the cost.

In a battlefield known for war, this peace-keeper just wants everyone to get along.\n\nAt the Rotary Club in LaGrange, Georgia, Rep. Jack Kingston answered every question, shook every hand he was offered with a \u201cthanks, man,\u201d or a \u201cyes, sir,\u201d and stooped quickly to pick up a business card that had fallen from a woman\u2019s purse.\n\nIn his pursuit of the Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Saxby Chambliss, Kingston left his audience with the impression that he is friendly, reasonable, and entirely competent. But in a GOP primary packed with Tea Party pleasers, pro-life crusaders, gun lovers, and a millionaire whose cousin is a former governor, being friendly, reasonable and entirely competent may be Jack Kingston\u2019s biggest problem.\n\n\u201cI think he was pretty much right on it,\u201d said Danny Graddy, a Republican and financial planner from Pine Mountain, Ga., who got what he was looking for in Kingston\u2019s Rotary speech, which focused on preserving America\u2019s military, supporting agriculture in the state, balancing the federal budget and ending the gridlock in Washington. \u201cBut being right on it and getting elected are two different things.\u201d\n\nTo Graddy\u2019s point, the congressman is stuck in what amounts to a five-way tie with Rep. Paul Broun, Rep. Phil Gingrey, former Secretary of State Karen Handel, and former CEO David Purdue. With just five weeks left until early voting begins for the May 20 primary, most polls show the five separated only by a margin of error. A recent PPP poll showed Broun with a double digit lead over the entire field.\n\nAn automated poll released Thursday showed Perdue, the former CEO of Reebok and Dollar General, leading with 29%, Kingston second with 19%, and Gingrey, Broun and Handel in the low double digits. Only Purdue and Kingston have run statewide television ads so far, a sign of each man's financial advantage. The deep-pocketed Perdue has given his campaign more than $1 million, while Kingston has dominated the money race to face off against Michelle Nunn in November, with more than $4 million raised.\n\nBroun has gotten activists\u2019 (and the media\u2019s) attention by giving away magazine-fed rifles on his campaign website, racking up local Tea Party endorsements, or offering up quotable declarations like calling evolution and other sciences \u201clies straight from the pit of Hell.\u201d\n\nBut Kingston is taking a different approach, suggesting his more than two decades in the House is proof that he knows Washington well enough to make it work for Georgia and listing \u201cuniting the country\u201d as one of his top priorities\u2014a concept so unusual in GOP primaries it is almost radical.\n\n\u201cI come from a county where you need to get things done,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes yelling and screaming is not the most effective way to get things done.\u201d\n\nOne recent exception to Kingston's message of moderation was a comment, captured by a Democratic campaign tracker, in which Kingston suggested school children sweep cafeteria floors to help put money toward free lunches.\n\nHe needs to capture Tea Party activists\u2019 passion, social conservatives\u2019 electoral power and Chamber of Commerce Republicans\u2019 money, all without running so far to the right that he becomes unelectable in November.\n\nKingston said the comment was part of a broader conversation about the benefits of chores for children that was misconstrued.\n\n\"Politics being politics, it's very difficult these days to have discussions without that 'I got you' sound bite.\"\n\nBut he said it's also evidence that Democrats consider him a formidable opponent.\n\n\"There's no question about it. They follow me around. They asked for 30 years of Freedom of Information Act requests on me. They're pretty focused on me.\"\n\nThe Democrats may be watching him closely, but what he really needs is more attention from Republicans. To that end, Kingston is also quick to talk up his conservative bona fides, calling himself \u201ca repeal and replace guy\u201d on Obamacare, listing his conservative ratings from National Journal (90 percent) and the American Conservative Union (95.8 percent). Tea Partiers have cried foul on Kingston\u2019s commitment to budget-cutting, outing him as a longtime member of the House Appropriations Committee, but he quickly points out he\u2019s the only House member in the race to give money back to the Treasury from his office budget.\n\nThe balance in Kingston\u2019s message reveals his dilemma, which is nearly identical to that of Republicans nationally. He needs to capture Tea Party activists\u2019 passion, social conservatives\u2019 electoral power and Chamber of Commerce Republicans\u2019 money, all without running so far to the right that he becomes unelectable in November.\n\n\u201cWhat I said today at the Rotary is what I say to the Tea Party groups and they appreciate it. I say it to mainstream Republican groups and they appreciate it,\u201d he said. \u201cI would unify the conservative family and I believe the conservative family needs to be unified.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a whisper-thin needle to thread, but it\u2019s the only way to win.\n\n\u201cWhoever we nominate, they have to make sure that they are appealing to a broad base,\u201d said Eric Tanenblatt, a top adviser to former Gov. Sonny Purdue, the late Sen. Paul Coverdell and Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cThe Republican primary electorate is very different from the electorate you\u2019ll see in the general election. If all you are going to do is try to appeal to the most conservative elements of the Republican primary electorate, it\u2019s going to make it very difficult for you to move to the center to win independent voters.\u201d\n\nThe off-year Republican primary in Georgia has recently rewarded the candidate who is best known, best financed, and most conservative. The 2010 Republican primary drew fewer than 700,000 voters in the state of nearly 10 million, with now- Gov. Nathan Deal beating Handel in the Republican primary runoff by fewer than 3,000 before defeating former Democratic Governor Roy Barnes by 10 points.\n\nA similar electorate should favor Kingston, who, like Deal, is a House member from outside of Atlanta whose appeal in the past has included business and social conservatives.\n\nBut GOP veterans say a combination of an unusually early primary, major winter storms and a late legislative session has combined to make the race \u201ca wide-open crap shoot,\u201d with the eventual winner anybody\u2019s guess. While the business-friendly Kingston is assumed to be the safest bet to keep the seat in Republican hands, many leaders worry privately that Broun\u2019s penchant for making headlines could win him the primary in the summer, but make him all but unelectable in November.\n\nFor Donny Graddy, it\u2019s like a movie he\u2019s seen before.\n\n\u201cI worry about how crowded the field is,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look back at the 2012 presidential primary, basically Republicans shot off all 10 of their toes before they ever ran against a Democrat.

And by taking this bait, the administration undercut its own credibility in making longer-term assurances about American sanctions relief.\n\n\u201cA non-binding agreement with Iran is easier to make (because the President can clearly do it on his own) and easier to break (because there is no domestic or international legal obstacle to breaking it),\u201d wrote Jack Goldsmith, a former assistant attorney general who now teaches law at Harvard, at Lawfare on Wednesday.\n\nThe letter, which was conceived of by freshman GOP Sen. Tom Cotton, was influenced in part by prominent national security hawk and Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol. Kristol said he had no part in drafting or editing the letter, but did consult with the senator about it.\n\n\u201cI did discuss it with Tom as he was conceiving it and pondering whether and how to do it. I know he consulted with others as well with some government and foreign policy experience, as you\u2019d expect,\u201d Kristol told The Daily Beast.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki noted on Tuesday that the Iran nuclear agreement wasn\u2019t exactly novel. Lots of previous international deals were \u201cnon-binding,\u201d too.\n\n\u201cIt will be the same kind of arrangement as many of our previous international security initiatives\u2014such as the framework negotiated with Russia to destroy Syria\u2019s chemical weapons, the Proliferation Security Initiative, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and non-security initiatives such as the recent U.S.-China Joint Announcement on Climate Change,\u201d a senior State Department official told The Daily Beast.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry made the same argument before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not negotiating a, quote \u2018legally binding plan.\u2019 We\u2019re negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement. We don\u2019t even have diplomatic relations with Iran right now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Obama administration highlighted that any deal with Iran would be a \u201cnon-binding\u201d agreement. And by taking this bait, the administration undercut its own credibility in making longer-term assurances about American sanctions relief.\n\nA senior State Department official also argued that \u201cthe overriding reason to prefer a non-binding international arrangement to a treaty is the need to preserve the greatest possible flexibility to re-impose sanctions if we believe Iran is not meeting its commitments under a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans thought twice about whether the open Iran letter was a needless agitation that hurts bipartisan Congressional efforts to prevent a bad nuclear deal.\n\nBut several days after its release, the effect of the open letter has been to clarify how precarious a deal with Iran could be after January 2017.\n\nThis raises questions about the durability of a deal that President Obama has said could have Iran agreeing to roll back its nuclear capabilities \u201cfor 10 years or longer.\u201d\n\nThe open letter to Iran (PDF) had two points: the power to make binding international agreements required congressional buy-in, and the fact that many of the senators would remain in office long after President Obama\u2019s second term had expired.\n\n\u201cThe letter forced the administration to explain why they\u2019re icing Congress out of Iran negotiations, and now that explanation has ignited a firestorm,\u201d said Omri Ceren, press director for the pro-Israel group The Israel Project. \u201cThe administration looks like it intentionally chose a weaker, non-binding arrangement, rather than a treaty, to avoid Senate oversight.\u201d\n\nOn one of the letter\u2019s core points, sanctions experts agree that an executive agreement could be undermined if the next president decides to change American policy.\n\n\u201cChanges the president makes now under his executive powers may not be agreeable by his successor. The next president, for example, could adopt a different posture regarding Iran and usher in new, harsher executive directives to financially constrict its access to international markets,\u201d said Stuart Jones Jr., a former senior Treasury Department official who now advises on matters of financial integrity for Ernst & Young in the Middle East. \u201cSuch a shift is not without precedent, however, it does project a higher degree of uncertainty around what \u2018guarantees\u2019 mean in the medium-term.\u201d\n\nIf an agreement with Iran is reached, President Obama could make it more difficult for a successor to withdraw from the agreement by gumming up the bureaucratic works.\n\nThrough executive orders and changes in State Department organization and policy, even a non-binding agreement could be strengthened. It\u2019s more difficult to shift a policy, for example, when there\u2019s an assistant secretary whose job depends on it.\n\n\u201cThe President could use an executive order to advance policy, and even instruct other federal agencies to create new offices or policies within his existing authority and using already appropriated funds,\u201d said Michael Zolandz, chair of Dentons\u2019 Public Policy & Regulation Practice. \u201cNevertheless it\u2019s still temporary\u2026 In this context, permanence is defined by the political will to change something.\u201d\n\nBecause the Iran negotiations include the five permanent U.N. Security Council member, one way that a non-binding executive agreement could become internationally-binding legal obligation is through a U.N. security resolution, Lawfare noted Thursday. This would, of course, be extremely controversial.\n\n\n\nIranian news outlets were quick to point out that the ongoing nuclear negotiations were not bilateral, and that if a future American president were to withdraw from an agreement, the United States could become diplomatically isolated.\n\n\u201cIran will close a nuclear deal with the P5+1 members, of which America is only one member,\u201d an editorial from Iranian pro-reform daily Arman-e Emruz read. \u201cSo if the next [U.S.] administration or the Congress sabotage such an agreement, America will be isolated and discredited in front of other world powers.\u201d\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by Shane Harris", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:16.088+0000"}

But this effort won\u2019t work the way it did on John Kerry.\n\nRepublican senatorial candidate Terri Lynn Land is losing in Michigan. Badly.\n\nSo what were Republicans to do, when they realized that their once highly touted candidate couldn\u2019t take down Rep. Gary Peters at the ballot box? Resurrect a successful 2004 strategy, of course. Lagging in the polls, they\u2019re raising questions about the details of the Democrat\u2019s military service record in an effort to disqualify him for a U.S. Senate seat. That was the playbook the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth used to discredit then-Sen. John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election, when they found officers who tangentially served alongside the candidate, if at all, and muddied up his record.\n\nIn the latest Republican strike, the conservative website Breitbart devoted nearly 4,000 words to a story about Peters\u2019s service in the U.S. Navy Reserve. The site says Peters received a \u201csharpshooter\u201d designation rather than the \u201cexpert\u201d designation he claims; that he worked alongside the Navy\u2019s Seabee construction battalion rather than as a Seabee, as he says; and that he had a mediocre and undistinguished service record.\n\nBreitbart cites two major sources to back up its claims: a commanding officer who served in the Seabees but whom Peters did not report to directly and the Republican National Committee\u2019s \u201cmilitary expert.\u201d But even the Seabees officer says Peters\u2019s service qualifies the candidate to call himself a Seabee. And one of the sources quoted by Breitbart appears to disparage Peters\u2019s overseas service in Bahrain simply because he was not stationed more closely to a war zone.\n\nIt\u2019s a last-ditch attempt by a faltering campaign to smear an opponent\u2019s military service record, an issue that hadn\u2019t previously been raised in the campaign.\n\nTo rebut the Breitbart story, the Peters campaign provided The Daily Beast with a document signed by a commanding officer showing that the candidate qualified as a Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist on August 5, 1998. Peters qualified as an \u201cexpert\u201d on the M16A1 in 1993 and the .38 revolver in 1995. He qualified as \u201csharpshooter\u201d on the M1911A1-45 ACP handgun in 1994.\n\nExcerpts from Peters\u2019s fitness reports, written by his commanding officers between in 1994 and 2004 and provided by his campaign, describe the senatorial candidate as a \u201crecognized expert\u201d who \u201cperform[s] exceptionally\u201d and has \u201cunlimited potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cLCDR Peters is an outstanding Supply Corps officer\u2026\u201d says one one fitness report from 2004. \u201cLCDR Peters\u2019 attention to detail, along with his working relationship with Air Force officers, has been instrumental in the continuation of a very successful and visible joint service operation while providing first class training.\u201d\n\nPeters joined the Navy Reserve in 1993 and was honorably discharged in 2008, the year he was elected to Congress.\n\nWith media outlets in Michigan apparently unwilling to follow Breitbart\u2019s lead, the effort to Swift-Boat Peters does not seem likely to be effective. It\u2019s a last-ditch attempt by a faltering campaign to smear an opponent\u2019s military service record, an issue that hadn\u2019t previously been raised in the campaign. Ten years ago, by contrast, casting Kerry\u2019s service in Vietnam in a negative light was a focal point in the GOP effort to turn the Democratic nominee's biggest strength into a weakness.\n\nThe attack comes as national Republican groups are all but giving up on Land\u2019s campaign: The National Republican Senatorial Committee recently canceled the remainder of the advertising it had reserved for her. The RealClearPolitics poll average for the race, meanwhile, has Peters up by 7.8 percentage points.\n\nThe Republican National Committee did not respond to a question about whether it supports Breitbart\u2019s line of criticism. The Land campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misattributed a statement about Bahrain to the Republican National Committee's military expert. It was actually made by a former Navy commander.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:17.090+0000"}

God bless America, Rick Perry is running for president again.\n\nPerry arrived in Addison, Texas, on Thursday to formally declare his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination\u2014again.\n\nAfter a tribute from his Precious Moments doll look-alike wife, Anita, Perry took to the lectern to discuss his humble beginnings in life, in a house with an outhouse and mother who sewed his own clothes until he reached adulthood. \u201cI\u2019ve seen American life,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it from the red dirt of a West Texas cotton field.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, Perry stood sandwiched between two large, bearded, sweating twins. Marcus and Morgan Luttrell are Navy SEALs, and Marcus is the author of Lone Survivor, which was turned into a film, released in 2013, starring Mark Wahlberg.

We will make it through the Obama years!\u201d\n\nIn a show of presidential levels of restraint, Perry did not laugh at his own joke.\n\nAhead of the event, Perry unveiled a campaign ad on his website. \u201cWe need a president who transcends the petty partisanship of the last few years,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone that\u2019s been tested.\u201d\n\nThe slickly produced video (which is, perhaps unintentionally, reminiscent of Johnny Cash\u2019s version of Hurt in its editing) depicts all versions of Perry: the over-gelled politician, speaking at the lectern in a blue tie and black-rimmed glasses; the Man of the People, shaking hands with and hugging voters; the Texan, being sworn in as governor in 2000 and riding on a Texas Highway Patrol boat; and the American, in his Air Force regalia and saluting with troops.\n\nPerry served as governor of Texas from 2000 to 2015, and memorably ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.

Since she became a national figure in 1992, Hillary Rodham Clinton has been one of the most famous, yet polarizing, Americans.\n\nIn fairness, Hillary Clinton earned some of the enmity. Especially when pressured, she and her husband have shown a tendency to, ahem, \u201cmisremember\u201d that makes Brian Williams look like George Washington. Her awkwardness and insecurity in 1992 and 1993 made it worse, as she often sounded like a stereotypical feminist hostile to traditional women and values. Still, in an era that is particularly hard on politicians, be it Al Gore, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama on the left or Sarah Palin, George W. Bush, and Dick Cheney on the right, Hillary hatred has been particularly virulent and irrational.\n\nWhile the Arkansas animus against the Yankee feminist living in the Governor\u2019s Mansion harks back to the 1980s, Hillary bashing as a national sport began on January 26, 1992. That night, after Super Bowl XXVI, Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared on a special \u201cSixty Minutes\u201d to refute charges that were true about Bill Clinton\u2019s unfaithfulness.\n\nUnderstanding that his candidacy\u2019s survival depended on her vouching for him, millions of Americans first met Hillary Clinton as she requested a zone of privacy. Mrs. Clinton offended millions of traditionalists\u2014and country music fans\u2014by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here like some little woman standin\u2019 by my man, like Tammy Wynette.\u201d Two months later, Clinton triggered more cultural alarms by boasting that while \u201cI could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas,\u201d she mastered a profession instead.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s prickly rhetoric made her easily cast as the ultimate \u201cfeminazi,\u201d the \u201cyuppie wife from hell,\u201d the harsh Northeastern careerist know-it-all. The sexual panic this caricature of her engendered could be seen in all the contradictory rumors about her, that she was at once frigid, a lesbian, and a heterosexual adulterer herself. To opponents, Hillary Clinton represented Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cMcGovernik\u201d tendencies, in Newt Gingrich\u2019s memorable label, absorbing all the anxieties about the Baby Boomers, the Sixties, and Bill Clinton\u2019s genuinely liberal pedigree and supposedly liberal master plan.\n\nWhen the Clintons\u2019 initial talk of a \u201cco-presidency\u201d involved her both in the health care reform debacle and a series of scandals from Travelgate to Whitewater, the traditional rumor mill became a post-modern, 24/7 media-fueled industry. In December 1993, David Brock\u2019s infamous \u201cTroopergate\u201d article exposing Bill Clinton\u2019s Arkansas philandering portrayed Hillary Clinton as unloved and unlovable. The article ultimately led to the Paula Jones lawsuit, which provided the legal foundation for Bill Clinton\u2019s 1998 impeachment\u2014and launched Brock\u2019s long quest for liberal redemption for serving as a Right Wing Hit Man.\n\nShe needs to be fighting for something, not asserting a claim. She should stand for principle not peddle her fame\u2014or her feeling that she deserves it.\n\nWith the Internet just emerging as a perpetual scandal-generator, Hillary-hating initially flourished thanks to magazines like Brock\u2019s American Spectator, Talk Radio, tabloid newspapers, and sensation-seeking 24/7 television news networks. Once, Rush Limbaugh broadcast a claim that the Clintons\u2019 friend Vince Foster was murdered in an apartment Hillary Clinton owned. When the charge proved to be false, Limbaugh shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what it said in the Fax,\u201d he said, and began his next tirade.\n\nAs First Lady, Hillary Clinton also absorbed a more traditional hostility that other activist First Ladies have stirred, when they were perceived as controlling, manipulative Lady Macbeths trying to seize power through pillow talk. The similar sexist caricatures mocking such dissimilar women as Hillary Clinton, Nancy Reagan and Eleanor Roosevelt, suggests the anxiety was cultural and institutional not just personal. Like Reagan and Roosevelt, Bill Clinton was a particularly charming, elusive president whose less popular, less slippery First Lady served conveniently as a lightening rod.\n\nWhile that hostility to Hillary the power-hungry radical persists, three critical shifts have diminished it. First, Hillary Clinton became a more passive, more traditional First Lady. That distance served her well during the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal, when millions of American women softened their impressions of her. Being pitied as a victim rather than respected as a powerhouse rankled this talented, intelligent, modern woman. Nevertheless, Clinton parlayed that sympathy into a revolutionary rehabilitative jump into traditional electoral politics, running for Senate in 2000 as Hillary!\u2014with her campaign posters preferring an exclamation point to her last name.\n\nAs New York\u2019s junior senator, Hillary Clinton confounded her critics. No longer vulnerable to accusations of trying to commandeer power through marriage, she was now a legitimate player with a real job on the political scene. And despite Hillary\u2019s reputation as a radical lesbian liberal feminist, in 2008 Barack Obama ran to her left.\n\nAs a senator in her mid-fifties\u2014and a national icon known by her first name, like Cher or Madonna\u2014Hillary also now felt more secure. Senator Clinton played against her celebrity, showing a humility and respect for seniority that charmed senators and voters. The warm, down-to-earth side her friends saw but many voters did not in the 1990s emerged.\n\nThe most astounding shift occurred during the searing 2008 Democratic primary campaign. The white working class men who had often detested Hillary with a particular Limbaughian Rush of bile, became her base in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Cynics believe these \u201cbitter\u201d Middle Americans, who \u201ccling to guns or religion or antipathy to others who are not like them\u201d\u2014in Obama\u2019s infamous phrasing\u2014were more racist than sexist. Actually, the connection went deeper. In those primaries, a more empathetic and visionary Hillary Clinton was running for a cause not just to advance herself or her husband. After winning West Virginia in May 2008, she vowed to continue campaigning \u201cfor the nurse on her second shift, for the worker on the line, for the waitress on her feet, for the small-business owner, the farmer, the teacher, the coal miner, the trucker, the soldier, the veteran.\u201d\n\nHere, then, is the critical lesson Hillary Clinton must master. The noise will grow, with Benghazi being played as a conspiracy that was her fault rather than a crime terrorists committed, with her aide Huma Abedin accused of being both a Muslim Brotherhood operative and Hillary\u2019s lesbian lover, etc., etc., etc. Googling \u201cHillary Clinton\u201d and \u201clesbian\u201d already generates over 5.6 million hits.\n\nBut most Americans have given Hillary Clinton\u2014and her husband\u2014the benefit of the doubt when the Clintons focused on substance not celebrity. She needs to be fighting for something, not asserting a claim. She should stand for principle not peddle her fame\u2014or her feeling that she deserves it. \u201cIt\u2019s my time\u201d talk will not play as well as \u201cIt\u2019s time to act\u201d talk. Foolishly, during her recent memoir rollout she traded on her personality, and wallowed in self-pity, unconsciously emphasizing how different she is from most Americans by claiming to be one of them in an area where she isn\u2019t\u2014net worth.\n\nHillary Clinton has to make the case that her presidency will accomplish something, despite the sniping. Many Americans will tolerate the negatives, if they believe there is something positive to be achieved. But if this campaign is just to add another line to the collective Clinton resume, enduring the inevitable Hillary Bashing won\u2019t be worth it\u2014perhaps even for her as well as for us.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:17.927+0000"}

Then Bush swung into campaign mode.\n\n\u201cThis is the greatest country on the face of the Earth, and now we need to start acting like it,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cIf we get beyond here today, I\u2019ll be back here a lot and I\u2019ll be asking for your support.\u201d\n\nOn this Iowa swing, Bush showed that when he had a question to prompt him, he was good, but when he had a roomful of people lined up to ask questions, he was even better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to tear down my fellow Republicans.\u201d\n\nIn the question-and-answer sessions at the Iowa Ag Summit earlier in the day, the open-ended queries posed a bit of a problem for Bush. He tended to run on, and event organizer/emcee Bruce Rastetter didn\u2019t exactly jump in to stop anyone from rambling. And his own sit-down with Bush ended on an awkward note.\n\n\u201cWell, it looks like we\u2019re out of time,\u201d Rastetter said, half-interrupting Bush.\n\n\u201cOh, darn it,\u201d the politician replied.\n\nFrom the agricultural summit it was off to Jethro\u2019s BBQ \u2019n Jambalaya, a restaurant with a backwoods name\u2014albeit none of the character\u2014in the rather plastic Des Moines suburb of Waukee. The place was packed\u2014although it was unclear how many people were there for Bush, or for the combination of mediocre chain-restaurant food and college basketball.\n\n\u201cI had to ask the waitress who he was,\u201d said one woman, sitting at the bar as Bush met with supporters in a backroom. No press was allowed.\n\nOthers knew. Roberta Gamble spotted Bush as soon as he walked through the door\u2014although self-described Reagan Republicans such as Gamble probably are more attuned than most to the presence of the GOP\u2019s royal family. Gamble\u2019s husband, Mark, is a fan. \u201cI like what he\u2019s done with school vouchers,\u201d he said.\n\nGamble family friend Michaela Shupe, however, is a Ben Carson supporter.\n\n\u201cI just think he\u2019s too liberal when it comes to immigration,\u201d she said about Bush, echoing what has been virtually the only conservative sticking point against Jeb in his fledgling campaign.\n\nIn reality, Bush isn\u2019t really too anything. His answers to Rastetter\u2019s questions could be described as generally Republican, vaguely conservative. There weren\u2019t really any big applause lines for Bush at the summit, and definitely no fireworks such as there were with Chris Christie, who delighted the crowd by shooing away a protester, saying it was good to see someone from New Jersey. Supposedly mild-mannered Iowans, the farmers listening to Christie do his best dick-move dismissal let out a pretty large cheer.\n\nBush didn\u2019t provide such moments, and he doesn\u2019t appear to be as willing to go on the offensive against his fellow Republicans as he is to go against Hillary Clinton, highlighting what he considers the disparity in transparency between the two. If he runs, Bush said at Pizza Ranch\u2014noting that nothing is yet official\u2014he would operate a \u201chopeful, optimistic campaign,\u201d and, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tear down my fellow Republicans.\u201d\n\nHe may not have to. The very thing that Shupe, the Ben Carson fan, criticized Bush for, and the major hurdle in front of him in socially conservative in Iowa, is what may make him a strong general-election candidate. He\u2019s safe, and he\u2019s already a relative moderate compared with any of the other wannabes who bounced all over Iowa this weekend, testing out jokes and lining up donors.\n\nAt Pizza Ranch, a few talking points emerged for the second time Saturday.\n\nThe United States is \u201cspending more money per student than any other country, besides two or three,\u201d Bush said.\n\n\u201cMy experience as governor,\u201d he added in regard to education, \u201cmakes me compelled to believe this should be a national priority\u2014not a federal program, but a national priority.\u201d\n\nBush also previewed a platform that stands against net neutrality, alongside Israel, and for executive orders\u2014depending on who\u2019s signing them.\n\n\u201cUndoing by executive order the things that have been done by executive order, that\u2019s legitimate,\u201d Bush said, announcing his intention to undo Obama\u2019s immigration decree if elected in 2016.\n\nBut Bush, after a vanilla performance at the ag summit, an uneventful series of grip-and-grins at Jethro\u2019s and his brief break to stand next to the man at Pizza Ranch, finally got enough sustained applause to be able to breathe easy for a moment.\n\n\u201cApprove the [Keystone] XL pipeline for cryin\u2019 out loud,\u201d he said.\n\nThat prompted head-nodding, raucous clapping\u2014and a brief smile from Bush.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:18.088+0000"}

They have banked on their seniority to solidify their status.\n\nAnd now, with their caucus at its largest ever, they have the numbers to cause some serious trouble if they\u2019re defied.\n\nIts members are upset over internal Democratic discussions about limiting the role of seniority in determining key leadership posts, and imposing term limits on how long lawmakers can hold those positions.\n\nThere are more black members of Congress than ever \u2013 46 members of the CBC in the current Congress (that\u2019s nearly quarter of the Democrats in the House -- there\u2019s just one Republican in the group) \u2013 wielding a historic amount of influence.\n\nBlack leaders have waited a generation for this moment.\n\nSeven CBC members are the top-ranking Democratic leaders on Congressional committees and 23 members have the top post on subcommittees, largely because of seniority -- how long they\u2019ve spent in Congress.\n\nAnd while not all Democrats support the current system -- any change to it at this moment would have a disproportionate effect on black members of Congress, members of the CBC said.\n\n\u201cThere's an old joke,\u201d said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, \u201cthat once African Americans get there, the rules are going to change. Once Latinos get there, the rules are going to change. The seniority system has been there almost since the beginning of the Republic.\"\n\nThe issue of term limits was brought up in late 2014, when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told a gathering of Democratic members that some of their colleagues were interested in addressing the issue. A number of House Democrats began speaking out in support of the change in January.\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi is playing with fire. There are a number of Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus members who have paid their dues and served their time on committees, and to have that taken away would create a tremendous amount of disappointment,\u201d a senior minority Congressional staffer told The Daily Beast.\n\nBlack members and their staffs grew alarmed. Although the Congressional Black Caucus has not yet taken a formal position on the matter, Chairman G.K. Butterfield told the Beast that \u201csentiment seems [to be] that we would vigorously oppose it.\u201d Cleaver estimated that \u201c90-ish percent\u201d of the CBC opposes both term limits and reducing the role of seniority.\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi is playing with fire. There are a number of Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus members who have paid their dues and served their time on committees, and to have that taken away would create a tremendous amount of disappointment,\u201d a senior minority Congressional staffer told The Daily Beast.\n\nWhile Congressional Black Caucus acknowledged that the proposed rule changes weren\u2019t maliciously designed to target them, they said the unintended consequence of the rule change would be to marginalize their membership.\n\nOther non-black members would certainly also be affected, they say, it has a particular effect on their members.\n\n\"The Congressional Black Caucus is the most influential caucus on the Hill. A lot of members would be impacted and affected, which presents a questions that all minority groups have to wrestle with: how do you leverage your voting block to bring about transformation?\" CBC vice chair Rep. Andre Carson told The Daily Beast.\n\nBlack members and staffers warn the rule changes could limit opportunities beyond committee leadership slots: repercussions could extend to the diversity of senior staff, and on developing the careers of black staffers who will go on to work at federal agencies, the White House or at lobbying firms. Capitol Hill has long suffered from a lack of black staffers.\n\n\u201cGiven that the most loyal constituency to the Democrats are African Americans -- who routinely vote 90 percent for them - a policy change like this can have an negative impact on other party efforts for recapturing the Senate, winning Governorships and the 2016 presidential election, even if it isn't intentional,\" argued Paul Brathwaite, a former executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nIn a private meeting of Democrats Tuesday morning to discuss internal rules, CBC member Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee spoke out against leadership, arguing that there was insufficient transparency on their decisions, including on the term limits debate.\n\nSo far Pelosi is keeping her distance from the issue.\n\nPelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said that the congresswoman \"has not taken a position on the issue\" of term limits and that any decision on rules would be \"up to the Members of the Caucus.\"\n\nOn its face, the proposal isn\u2019t a novel concept. House Republicans currently term limit their top committee posts to three terms or six years. While seniority plays a role, it is not the determining factor as to who gets to lead the committee. But the rule - implemented in 1994 - isn\u2019t as controversial within the GOP ranks.\n\nIronically, while African American lawmakers are aghast at any attack on the seniority system, which they see as the strongest guarantee of their clout on Capitol Hill, it was one of the greatest obstacles of the civil rights movement. For decades, white Southern Democrats clung to it as the source of their power in the House of Representatives and used it to block civil rights bills and other progressive legislation.\n\nStill, some Congressional Black Caucus members don\u2019t want this to be viewed as a racial issue. There are many white representatives who oppose term limits, the most vocal of whom tend to be the Democratic leaders on their committees.\n\nRep. Karen Bass, a CBC member who is leading a Democratic committee to review internal rules, has remained entirely neutral on the matter.\n\n\"What I am concerned about more than anything is the attempt to completely characterize this as a black caucus versus the Dem caucus,\" she said.\n\nThis view was only \"partially true,\" Bass added, since \"you have white members who are ranking members on committees who are as concerned about term limits as anybody else.\"\n\nCBC members say that the policy change would hurt Hispanic members of Congress as well \u2013 but these issues have not generated nearly the same interest from Hispanic Democrats as from the CBC.\n\n\u201cThere is a diversity of opinions within the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. The CHC has not yet discussed this issue in the current Congress,\u201d said Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Linda S\u00e1nchez.\n\nThe issues of term limits and seniority promise to be hot topics at the annual retreat House Democrats are holding in Philadelphia this week. \"I doubt if many Democrats will make it through the week without having had some discussion with another Democrat\" about the matter, Cleaver said.\n\nThere promises to be frustration at the retreat over the two topics \u2013 and in many ways it is a proxy for frustration over the Democratic Party\u2019s current state.\n\n\"The problem that people are trying to resolve is that we went from 200 [seats] to 188, and members are not feeling as though there is enough opportunity,\" Bass said. \"My concern is that I don't want to see the caucus fractured and turn on each other.\"\n\nBen Jacobs contributed to this report.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:18.379+0000"}

But some Democratic diehards won\u2019t take no for an answer, and are already building a campaign for her.\n\nShe is, she insists, not interested, telling The Boston Globe, \u201cThere is no wiggle room. I am not running for president. No means no.\u201d\n\nBut for the organizers behind Ready for Warren, the SuperPAC trying to draft the Massachusetts senator into the 2016 presidential race, the door remains open for a potential run. So the group is staffing up in key early primary states and raising money in what they say will be an all-out blitz after the midterm elections designed to show Warren that there is a groundswell of support behind her.\n\nAnd if many of the organizers and early supporters of the Warren for President seemed unfazed by the notion that Hillary Clinton is an all-but inevitable Democratic nominee, perhaps that is because many of them have seen this process play out before\u2014when they backed a previously unknown freshman senator from Illinois named Barack Obama who went on to topple the Clinton machine.\n\n\u201cI was in the Obama world,\u201d said Erica Sagrans, who is helping lead the draft Warren effort and who served as northeast digital director of the Obama re-election campaign in 2012 after working for the pro-Obama outfit Organizing for America in 2009. \u201cThere are a lot of people in that world who are Warren fans, who really like Warren. But this is still a moment when people aren\u2019t entirely comfortable coming forward.\u201d\n\nA number of veterans of Obama-world, however, are now out and proud Warren-ites. There is Kate Albright-Hanna, most recently a spokesperson for Zephyr Teachout\u2019s upstart New York gubernatorial primary against Andrew Cuomo, and who joined the Obama effort way back in 2007 as the director of online video. Now she is preparing to take an as of yet undefined role with Ready for Warren.\n\n\u201cI am interested in building the progressive movement,\u201d she said, citing a campaign continuum that stretched from Howard Dean in 2004, through Obama in 2008 and Teachout in 2014. \u201cGetting involved in Elizabeth Warren is just continuing along that same branch. \u201c\n\nShe said that the excitement around Warren now was similar to that around Obama in 2007.\n\n\u201cBefore \u2018change\u2019 became such a clich\u00e9 and everybody became disillusioned, there was a moment where people got excited and thought that we can actually change the way politics is conducted. We don\u2019t have to be beholden to entrenched interests. All of that was epitomized in the early days of the Obama campaign, and there is the same sense now, that we don\u2019t have to settle for what we have been given.\u201d\n\nAs for Clinton, Albright-Hanna said, \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to the 1990\u2019s.\u201d\n\nDeborah Sagner raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Obama\u2019s campaign. Now, she calls herself one of the \u201cfirst funders\u201d of the Warren effort, having donated $20,000 to Ready for Warren already.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about timing and she is in the right place at the right time with the right message. In a few months it is going to take off. She won\u2019t be willing to buck the tide that is carrying her forward.\n\n\u201cI have a history of not supporting Hillary Clinton that goes back to 2007,\u201d Sagner said. \u201cI have never been particularly inspired by her. And I was very inspired by Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nSagner said that she was concerned that Clinton was too hawkish and close to Wall Street, but added a point repeated by many Warren supporters: that robust debate, and a spirited primary, is good for the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cI think it is good for the Democratic Party to have a progressive wing that challenges business as usual.\u201d\n\nAnd if Warren seems like an unlikely upstart now, so did Obama at this time eight years ago.\n\n\u201c[That campaign] made me think that it\u2019s possible that this could happen. There are some parallels. And these things can just catch on and get going.\u201d\n\nThere are also, of course, several non-parallels. Clinton, for one thing, is in a far stronger position than she was in 2000, back when voters still remembered her husband\u2019s administration for its scandals rather than for its economic record, and back when Hillary was still paying for her Iraq War vote. Early polling shows her with a commanding\u2014if not outright prohibitive\u2014lead among Democratic voters. Additionally, Ready for Hillary, the SuperPAC supporting her effort, has already raised $8 million, and the bulk of the Democratic establishment has signed on, including some of the party\u2019s most well-known political operatives.\n\nReady for Warren, meanwhile, has raised between $50,-100,000 according to organizers, and although it\u2019s still preparing to open offices in New Hampshire, Iowa, and South Carolina, it has so far signed up a few hundred volunteers. But there are as of yet no prominent political supporters, and perhaps its most well-known advisor is Billy Wimsatt, a longtime progressive political activist and the author of the cult classic Bomb The Suburbs.\n\n\u201cThis is an inside/outside effort,\u201d said Sagrans \u201cThere are people that have connections and roots in the DC political world, and there are people that are grassroots activists around the country.\u201d\n\nThe group, however, recently bombarded the Harkin Steak Fry in Iowa, where Hillary made what many observers saw as her triumphant return to the national political stage. They are in discussions with several polling firms, and are planning a nationwide night of phone-banking later this month on behalf of Senate candidates that Warren has endorsed. They know that 2016 activity is on hold until November, but are aware that once the midterms are over, the presidential primary process begins in earnest. And if Warren is to feel that there is support out there for her, than the Ready for Warren team has a very short window to show it.\n\nThis means kicking up their fundraising in a major way. The group has already hired Bulldog Finance Group, a fundraising outfit founded by Scott Dworkin, who served on Obama\u2019s inaugural committee in 2009, and which is staffed by another vet of the Obama 2008 campaign.\n\n\u201cWe are helping Ready for Warren with two main goals,\u201d said Jerald Lentini, vice-president of the firm and a former staffer with the AFL-CIO. \u201cThe first is encouraging Elizabeth Warren to run for president, because she is absolutely the best progressive out there. And the second is to build an organization that can help Senator Warren win when she decides to run.\u201d\n\nBut the early Warren supporters are not just pulled from the ranks of people who helped derail Clinton\u2019s ambitions in 2008. Audrey Blondin served on Hillary\u2019s campaign in Connecticut in 2008, and as the elected state Democratic committeewoman, also worked on the campaigns of such establishment figures as Al Gore and John Kerry.\n\n\u201cThat was then. This is now,\u201d she said. Blondin is a bankruptcy lawyer, like Warren, and has known her for decades. She held a house party for Ready for Warren over the summer, and said she was unswayed by the senator\u2019s denials.\n\n\u201cI understand that she says she is not interested in running. I have been in politics 35 years. I know what happens. You think she is not watching what we are doing? Of course she is. And that is going to make a difference. It\u2019s all about timing and she is in the right place at the right time with the right message. In a few months it is going to take off. She won\u2019t be willing to buck the tide that is carrying her forward.\u201d\n\nAnd if she does buck that tide, it does not necessarily mean that it is end of the Warren for President boomlet. According to Daniel Buk, a political consultant who raised $40,000 for Obama in 2012 but has given $20,000 to Ready for Warren this year, there is already talk of keeping the group together through the 2020 election cycle.\n\n\u201cThere is real excitement here,\u201d Buk said. \u201cAnd there is a real potential, should Senator Warren reveal her plans.\u201d", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:19.174+0000"}
{"entityId": 1775, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "These weren\u2019t just ordinary secrets found in Clinton\u2019s private server, but some of the most classified material the U.S. government has.\n\nAfter months of denials and delaying actions, Hillary Clinton has decided to turn over her private email server to the Department of Justice. As this controversy has grown since the spring, Clinton and her campaign operatives have repeatedly denied that she had placed classified information in her personal email while serving as secretary of state during President Obama\u2019s first term. (\u201cI am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received,\u201d she said last month.) Her team also denied that she would ever hand over her server to investigators. Now both those assertions have been overturned.\n\nHillary Clinton has little choice but to hand over her server to authorities since it now appears increasingly likely that someone on her staff violated federal laws regarding the handling of classified materials. On August 11, after extensive investigation, the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general reported to Congress that it had found several violations of security policy in Clinton\u2019s personal emails.\n\nMost seriously, the inspector general assessed that Clinton\u2019s emails included information that was highly classified\u2014yet mislabeled as unclassified. Worse, the information in question should have been classified up to the level of \u201cTOP SECRET//SI//TK//NOFORN,\u201d according to the inspector general\u2019s report.\n\nYou may have seen acronym lists like these on declassified documents before\u2014and glazed over them. This is the arcane language of the cleared cognoscenti, so let me explain what this means:\n\n\u2022 TOP SECRET, as the name implies, is the highest official classification level in the U.S. government, defined as information whose unauthorized release \u201ccould cause exceptionally grave damage to national security or foreign relations.\u201d\n\n\u2022 SI refers to Special Intelligence, meaning it is information derived from intercepted communications, which is the business of the National Security Agency, America\u2019s single biggest source of intelligence. They\u2019re the guys who eavesdrop on phone calls, map who\u2019s calling whom, and comb through emails. SI is a subset of what the intelligence community calls Sensitive Compartmented Information, or SCI. And these materials always require special handling and protection. They are to be kept in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, which is a special hardened room that is safe from both physical and electronic intrusion.\n\n\u2022 TK refers to Talent Keyhole, which is an intelligence community caveat indicating that the classified material was obtained via satellite.\n\n\u2022 NOFORN, as the name implies, means that the materials can only be shown to Americans, not to foreigners.\n\nIn short: Information at the \u201cTOP SECRET//SI//TK//NOFORN\u201d level is considered exceptionally highly classified and must be handled with great care under penalty of serious consequences for mishandling. Every person who is cleared and \u201cread on\u201d for access to such information signs reams of paperwork and receives detailed training about how it is to be handled, no exceptions\u2014and what the consequences will be if the rules are not followed.\n\nPeople found to have willfully mishandled such highly classified information often face severe punishment. Termination of employment, hefty fines, even imprisonment can result.\n\nIn the real world, people with high-level clearances are severely punished for willfully violating such rules. At a minimum, those suspected of mishandling things like NSA \u201csignals intelligence\u201d\u2014intercepts calls, emails, and the like\u2014have their clearances suspended pending the outcome of the investigation into their misconduct. Any personal items\u2014computers, electronics\u2014where federal investigators suspect the classified material wound up, wrongly, will be impounded and searched. If it has TOP SECRET//SI information on it, \u201cyour\u201d computer now belongs to the government, because it is considered classified.\n\nPeople found to have willfully mishandled such highly classified information often face severe punishment. Termination of employment, hefty fines, even imprisonment can result. Yes, people really do go to jail for mishandling classified materials. Matthew Aid, a writer on intelligence matters, served more than a year in prison for mishandling TOP SECRET//SI information from the NSA, for example. The well-connected tend to avoid jail, however. Sandy Berger and John Deutsch\u2014who both served in high-level positions under President Bill Clinton, did not go to prison for mishandling TOP SECRET intelligence (though Berger got probation and was fined $50,000).\n\nWhat, then, does all this mean for Hillary Clinton? There is no doubt that she, or someone on her State Department staff, violated federal law by putting TOP SECRET//SI information on an unclassified system. That it was Hillary\u2019s private, offsite server makes the case even worse from a security viewpoint. Claims that they \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d such information was highly classified do not hold water and are irrelevant. It strains belief that anybody with clearances didn\u2019t recognize that NSA information, which is loaded with classification markings, was signals intelligence, or SIGINT. It\u2019s possible that the classified information found in Clinton\u2019s email trove wasn\u2019t marked as such. But if that classification notice was omitted, it wasn\u2019t the U.S. intelligence community that took such markings away. Moreover, anybody holding security clearances has already assumed the responsibility for handling it properly.\n\nAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton had no authority to disseminate intelligence-community information on her own, neither could she make it less highly classified (a process termed \u201cdowngrading\u201d in the spy trade) without asking permission first.\n\nIt is a very big deal and less-connected people who do this sort of thing ruin their lives, as any IC counterintelligence official can attest. During my NSA time, I saw junior personnel terminated for relatively minor infractions of security regulations. While the U.S. government unquestionably does over-classify items on the policy side, where almost everything in the Defense and State Departments gets some sort of classification stamp, not usually at a high level, intelligence reporting by its very nature is classified. If you don\u2019t want the responsibility of a high-level government position, which inevitably brings with it TOP SECRET//SI access, then don\u2019t accept that burden.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about Hillary Clinton\u2019s Emailgate. Exactly how many emails contained TOP SECRET//SI information is unclear. We may never know since thousands of emails were already destroyed by Clinton. Who exactly placed the classified information in emails\u2014it may not have been Hillary Clinton\u2014and how did they access the information in the first place? How many of her staffers at Foggy Bottom were also using her personal server?\n\nUnderlying all this is the question of why Hillary Clinton decided to employ her own private email and server to handle so much of her official State Department business. This is, to say the least, highly irregular\u2014not to mention a violation of numerous U.S. government rules and regulations\u2014so there had to be a compelling reason to do this. What was it?\n\nThe Clinton campaign was concerned enough about the issue to send out an email blast Wednesday afternoon with the subject line: \u201cA note about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might hear some news over the next few days about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails,\u201d began the email from Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for Hillary for America.\n\n\u201cBecause you are an important part of this team, we wanted to take a few minutes to talk through the facts\u2014we need your help to make sure they get out there. There\u2019s a lot of misinformation, so bear with us; the truth matters on this.\u201d\n\nUnderneath the greeting were several bolded bullet points, including, \u201cHillary didn\u2019t send any classified materials over email.\u201d There was also a link to a longer, 4,000+ word explanation of why Clinton used a private email address and server in her official capacity as secretary of state.\n\nThe FBI is now on the case and one hopes they will exercise due diligence in their investigation of what may be a serious leak of classified information, made worse by the fact that Clinton\u2019s personal server was wholly unencrypted for three months, leaving it wide open to exploitation by foreign intelligence services.\n\nThe number of spy services interested in the communications of the U.S. secretary of state numbers more than a hundred. Given their technical proficiency, it\u2019s na\u00efve to assume that the Russians and Chinese aren\u2019t among them\u2014a fact that John Kerry, the current secretary, recently admitted.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to assume, then, that Moscow and Beijing know what Hillary\u2019s \u201cprivate\u201d emails as Secretary of State contained.

According to a draft of the document circulated this week, de Blasio will call for the passage of comprehensive immigration and for Democrats to \u201coppose trade deals that hand more power to corporations at the expense of American jobs, workers\u2019 rights, and the environment.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama has called for a new Pacific trade deal that he says would open up new markets for American goods.

The mayor has pushed for a $13 minimum wage indexed to inflation, which would not rise to $15 until 2019. The mayor\u2019s push locally for the $13 minimum wage has likewise been rejected by Albany.\n\nDe Blasio is expected to be joined in Washington by a more than 60 members of Congress, progressive activists, and labor leaders, among them Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley, Congressmen Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva, and the actor Susan Sarandon. Last month de Blasio convened a number of progressive thinkers at Gracie Mansion, including Nation editor Katrina Vanden Heuvel and civil rights activist Van Jones to hash out ideas about how to build a progressive agenda in 2016. De Blasio has pointedly declined to endorse Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid, even though he was the campaign manager of her 2000 Senate run in New York and even though both Bill and Hillary Clinton were on stage with de Blasio at his inauguration.\n\nAides to de Blasio dismiss the suggestion that this effort is designed to lift de Blasio\u2019s profile, and say instead that it is intended to get a more progressive government into Washington, D.C.\u2014one that will be more attentive to New York City\u2019s needs.

That\u2019s what matters.\n\nBut Obama does it, and Bergdahl\u2019s freedom isn\u2019t what matters at all. It\u2019s that we negotiated with terrorists. Well, yes. We\u2019ve been negotiating with the Taliban for a long time now, trying to end the war. See, they\u2019re the people leading the fighting on the other side. When you\u2019re trying to end a war, that\u2019s generally who you negotiate with.\n\nThe five guys we returned to the Taliban are really bad guys, as Eli Lake and Josh Rogin wrote this weekend, and it\u2019s fair to ask whether the price was too high. We can\u2019t know the answer to that question today. But other criticisms are bogus. House intel chairman Mike Rogers said on TV Sunday that in cutting the deal, \u201cyou send a message to every al Qaeda group in the world that there is some value in a hostage that it didn\u2019t have before.\u201d That\u2019s ridiculous. So al Qaeda groups didn\u2019t know until this past weekend that taking an American hostage could give them leverage? Guerrilla forces have been taking people hostage since warfare began. We\u2019ve even done lower-level prisoner trades in Afghanistan.\n\nLooking forward, and looking more broadly at this situation, all the ingredients are here for a classic GOP Obama-conspiracy-mongering soap opera that can be dragged out until January 2017. The late combat journalist Mike Hastings wrote a long profile of Bergdahl in Rolling Stone in 2012, and it gets right to the heart of what may be the coming GOP case against him.\n\nFirst of all, Bergdahl wasn\u2019t any Republican\u2019s idea of a patriot. Yes, he volunteered to join the Army, but only after he\u2019d been turned down by the French Foreign Legion. Once on the ground in Afghanistan, he was a deeply disillusioned soldier. Shortly after his battalion took its first casualty, he emailed his parents a scathing indictment of the military and everything he saw around him. From Hastings:\n\n\u201cI am sorry for everything here,\u201d Bowe told his parents. \u201cThese people need help, yet what they get is the most conceited country in the world telling them that they are nothing and that they are stupid, that they have no idea how to live.\u201d He then referred to what his parents believe may have been a formative, possibly traumatic event: seeing an Afghan child run over by an MRAP. \u201cWe don\u2019t even care when we hear each other talk about running their children down in the dirt streets with our armored trucks \u2026 We make fun of them in front of their faces, and laugh at them for not understanding we are insulting them.\u201d\n\nBowe concluded his email with what, in another context, might read as a suicide note. \u201cI am sorry for everything,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe horror that is america is disgusting.\u201d\n\nHe wandered away from his unit. A Fox News commentator called him a \u201cdeserter.\u201d He is officially in good standing in the Army and has even received the promotions due him during his time in captivity, but some consider him a deserter and traitor. Get ready to start hearing more of that.\n\nWhen it comes to wet impeachment dreams, Benghazi may have just been pushed to the back seat.\n\nThe argument will be made that he wasn\u2019t worth saving, especially given what we had to give up. Hastings cites \u201cWhite House sources\u201d as telling him that Marc Grossman, Richard Holbrooke\u2019s successor as AfPak coordinator, \u201cwas given a direct warning by the president\u2019s opponents in Congress about trading Bowe for five Taliban prisoners during an election year. \u2018They keep telling me it\u2019s going to be Obama\u2019s Willie Horton moment,\u2019 Grossman warned the White House.\u201d\n\nCan Republicans make this resonate outside their base? Hard to say. I think to most Americans, this is a feel-good story. We value a life, one American life. Bibi Netanyahu traded one captive Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, not for five Palestinian prisoners. He traded Shalit for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners. And there was broad agreement across the spectrum of Israeli politics that bringing Shalit to safety, even at that price, was the right thing to do.\n\nBut of course, that doesn\u2019t matter to the right. No one outside their base cares much about Benghazi, but that hasn\u2019t stopped them. They\u2019ll keep pursuing Benghazi mostly to see if they can pin anything on Hillary, but when it comes to wet impeachment dreams, Benghazi may have just been pushed to the back seat.

A night of new beginnings, of toasting old friends, of celebrating the safe and healthy end to another year.\n\nAnd for one conservative political action committee, a night to raise some cold hard cash while slagging on the liberal media and their lefty New Year\u2019s Eve broadcasts.\n\n\u201cBottom line: this New Years Eve, you need not watch the mainstream TV networks with hosts and guests who will inject their liberal propaganda into everything, especially as they review the events of the year,\u201d read the invitation this morning from the Conservative Campaign Committee. \u201cNo, instead, we conservatives are going to get together for a massive celebration of our values, our victories and our plans heading into 2015!\u201d\n\nThe Conservative Campaign Committee is an offshoot of the Tea Party Express, an umbrella group of Tea Party organizations founded by a trio of Republican consultants. And it\u2019s supported by some controversial figures within the conservative movement, including Sherriff Joe Arapio and Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher, also known as \u201cJoe the Plumber.\u201d In the announcement of their New Year\u2019s Eve party, the group says they hope to raise $100,000 off of the event.\n\nIf that sounds removed from the spirit of merriment that the holiday usually entails, so does much of the rest of the planned party, which will be an all-day, 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. affair livestreamed around the world.\n\n\u201cDuring the Conservative New Years Party will be reviewing some of the victories achieved by conservatives in 2014 and mapping out our plans to win even more election victories in 2015. We'll also be laying out the road map to offer conservative plans to counter Barack Obama's destructive policies,\u201d the group writes. \u201cFinally, we'll be discussing the game plan to secure a conservative GOP presidential nominee who will soundly defeat Hillary Clinton and any other Democrat presidential candidates who step forward in the year to come.\u201d\n\nAmong the resolutions the Conservative Campaign Committee is making for the new year is \u201cCounter Barack Obama's liberal agenda\u201d while ensuring that the president doesn\u2019t \u201cget away with abusing executive privileges, pushing through amnesty proposals, stoking racial divisiveness, and more.\u201d They also resolve to opposing Hillary Clinton and trying to \u201cmake sure we have a good, strong constitutional conservative as the Republican presidential nominee.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the Conservative New Years Party will be reviewing some of the victories achieved by conservatives in 2014 and mapping out our plans to win even more election victories in 2015.\u201d\n\nMost New Year\u2019s revelers, if they are not in fact reveling but home watching the revels on TV, tune in to watch the ball drop from Times Square. That celebration is hosted by the decidedly apolitical Ryan Seacrest, who has not aired his political leanings aside from once Tweeting a picture of himself voting, and having Joe Biden on his radio show for an interview that the Los Angeles Times described as the vice president \u201caiming at a lower bar.\u201d\n\nSeacrest\u2019s co-host, Jenny McCarthy, is mostly known for being an outspoken anti-vaccine activist. The late Dick Clark, who hosted the Times Square celebration for decades, was similarly apolitical, although after his passing he was honored on the floor of the House of Representatives by a Republican lawmaker who called the American Bandstand host \u201ca believer in the free-enterprise system\u2026a believer in encouraging individual initiative and opportunity on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nThe invite also said that the group would have a host of conservative superstars joining them for their rightist bacchanal, but did not include any who had signed up, and executives with the Conservative Campaign Committee did not return multiple phone calls seeking comment.\n\nBut if any conservatives out there fear that their holiday may be overtaken with discussion of defunding the Export-Import Bank or the Hyde Amendment, fret not; the party ends at 11 pm, leaving free marketeers plenty of time to guzzle a glass of champagne before seeing what those Jacobins in Times Square are up to.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:20.421+0000"}

What caused them to collectively freak out? Comedy. Or, more specifically, President Obama appearing on the humorous Zach Galifianakis web series, \u201cBetween Two Ferns.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s truly mind boggling that something so funny could make so many on the right so angry. Republican Congressman Randy Weber tweeted: \u201cInstead of wasting time with a parody interview, he should be focusing on finding answers re: #Benghazi.\u201d Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Five\u201d spent approximately 12 minutes bashing the video and Bill O\u2019Reilly commented: \u201cAll I can tell you is Abe Lincoln would not have done it.\u201d For once, I agree with O\u2019Reilly. Lincoln never would\u2019ve appeared on \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d because Zack Galifianakis hadn\u2019t been born yet and the Internet didn\u2019t exist in the 1860\u2019s.\n\nThe right being outraged over comedy is nothing new. They have long been angry at jokes they don\u2019t agree with and the people who tell them. We have seen them criticize Jon Stewart, Bill Maher, Sarah Silverman, and Wanda Sykes to name a few.\n\nOn Wednesday, the conservative publication Newsbusters complained that Jimmy Fallon, the new host of the esteemed Tonight Show, took an \u201cunnecessary swipe\u201d at Sarah Palin. Translation: Fallon told a joke about Palin they didn\u2019t like. They have even come after me and I\u2019m not even in the same universe as these other comedians! But it doesn\u2019t matter. Famous or not, the right is scouring the airwaves for any joke they don\u2019t like.\n\nThe right doesn\u2019t seem to grasp that the more they attack well-known, popular comedians for their jokes, the more they end up pushing away the younger people who like these comedians. It makes the right appear more rigid and unable to laugh at itself. And that\u2019s not a good look. (See: the 2011 White House Correspondent\u2019s Dinner when Donald Trump refused to laugh at jokes that Seth Meyers was telling about him. Not pretty.)\n\nSo why are so many on the right angered by comedy? Were they abused by a comedian when they were young? Maybe their lunch money was stolen by the class clown?\n\nHere\u2019s my theory: Conservatives fear comedy because they aren\u2019t good at it. Sure, some of them are unintentionally funny. (I\u2019m looking at you Michele Bachmann and Ted Cruz.) But how many famous conservative comedians can you name? Dennis Miller and Drew Carey. Even if there are a few more, the list is dwarfed by the number of famous progressive comedians.\n\nThe right\u2019s anger over being comically challenged is made worse by that fact that they so desperately want to be funny.\n\nPlus, I believe that the right\u2019s anger over being comically challenged is made worse by that fact that they so desperately want to be funny. They understand the power of comedy. It can truly be more effective than a speech at undermining your political opponents because people are laughing at them. No doubt that\u2019s one of the reasons Fox News created a right wing version of The Daily Show a few years ago. Too bad it was an epic fail.\n\n\n\nYou really have to wonder why there are so few well-known professional conservative comedians. My theory is that comedy inherently challenges the status quo and the right generally tries to preserve that. Plus, people who become comedians tend not to subscribe to the traditional ideas of career, work or even bathing habits. Conservatives do.\n\nOne very funny conservative comedian, who didn\u2019t want his name mentioned, \u201crejects the premise of my article,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t go into more detail.\n\nComedian Frank Coniff, however, best known as \u201cTV\u2019s Frank\u201d from Mystery Science Theater, saidt: \u201cThe best comedy is always on the side of the underdog, and conservatives are on the side the powerful.\u201d Comedian/writer Leighann Lord echoed Frank\u2019s sentiments: \u201cComedy is at its best when it gives voice to the underdog having the courage to say out loud what people are thinking.\u201d\n\nJason Sattler, the man behind the popular satirical Twitter account \u201c@LOLGOP,\u201d which mocks Republicans, said, \u201cConservatives focus on being funny almost exclusively to people who agree with them.\u201d He believes they won\u2019t take the chance of doing comedy and publicly failing, adding conservatives, \u201cusually prefer failing in private\u2014like at bathroom stalls in an international airport, for instance.\u201d\n\nOne thing is clear, the conservatives outrage over comedy\u2014be it by President Obama, Jon Stewart or any other comedian\u2014is not going to help in attracting the younger votes they so desperately need.

But that\u2019s where Mudhar Shawkat, a wealthy Iraqi businessman who has a long history with U.S. intelligence, is making his stand against the self-proclaimed Islamic State.\n\nShawkat, a Sunni who made his money in the telecom business and running a private security firm called Babylon Eagles, says he\u2019s fielding an autonomous, Sunni army to go toe-to-toe with ISIS and liberate the huge swaths of Iraq that the militants have conquered. And his men are ready to fight without the help of the central government in Baghdad, he says.\n\nShawkat gave his London address on disclosure forms filed with the U.S. Senate last week, when he hired a band of Washington, D.C., lobbyists to help him open a second front in his campaign. The firm is run by former Idaho senator Steve Symms and two ex-senior congressional aides. Their mission: to arrange meetings for Shawkat with U.S. lawmakers and power brokers who might bless his grand vision and help it gain support in Washington.\n\n\u201cGive me a chance to have a Sunni fight against ISIS,\u201d Shawkat told The Daily Beast in an interview, as he was shuttling between Lebanon and Erbil, in the Kurdish-controlled northern portion of Iraq. Shawkat insists that because ISIS itself is composed of Sunnis, only warriors from its own sect are prepared to slay it. That, and there\u2019s no way in hell he wants Iranian-backed Shiite militias to do the job. That would only give Tehran more sway over the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad.\n\nSo far, Iranian-backed Shiite militias have been running a ground fight against ISIS forces, supported by U.S.-led airstrikes. But in the long term, leaving the terror group\u2019s destruction to Shiites courts disaster, Shawkat said. President Obama has said he\u2019s committed to wiping out ISIS, but his plan seems to require Iran\u2019s help to do that. And now, after the recent nuclear deal with Iran, Shawkat and some of his Sunni compatriots in exile are questioning the administration\u2019s commitment to backing them up.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want to form an army that will be led by former Iraqi officers,\u201d said Shawkat, who speaks in a smooth baritone and has near-perfect English. Those men, of course, served under Iraq\u2019s former (Sunni) dictator, Saddam Hussein. That\u2019s only the first controversial element of Shawkat\u2019s private war plan. Those officers were thrown out when the U.S. occupation force disbanded the Iraqi military in 2003, but he wants to put them back in uniform. They will lead a force of some 10,000 men who Shawkat says are ready to march once they\u2019re armed.\n\n\u201cWe want to form an army that will be led by former Iraqi officers.\u201d Those men, of course, served under Iraq\u2019s former dictator, Saddam Hussein. That\u2019s only the first controversial element of Shawkat\u2019s private war plan.\n\nShawkat was in Washington last week and said he met with more than a dozen senators and congressmen, from both parties, including the respective chairs of the Senate and House armed services committees, John McCain and Ed Royce. He\u2019s confident that one or both committees will hold a hearing this year on Sunni efforts to rid Iraq of ISIS. Spokesmen for both lawmakers didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThose 10,000 men, Shawkat said, consist of \u201cconscripts\u201d from in and around Mosul, where ISIS took over in a blazing assault last June, as well as members of the so-called Sunni Awakening that fought the Islamist militants during the U.S-led war that ousted Hussein. Current and former U.S. military officers and intelligence officials have credited their efforts with helping to turn the tide of the war in 2007 and 2008. And now, the Obama administration is encouraging more Sunnis to join in the fight, particularly through efforts by the central Iraqi government to train fighters in concert with Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar province, which has been overrun by ISIS.\n\nBut Shawkat wants a separate army, cleaved off from Baghdad, and that makes his plan more radical than other would-be Sunni standard bearers who\u2019ve said they\u2019re willing to try to work with Iraq\u2019s Shiite prime minister, Haider al-Abadi.\n\n\u201cI will not work under him, because I will lose my base,\u201d Shawkat said, which he claims comes from a 1 million-strong movement that he leads called the National Salvation Front, established in 2014. Shawkat insists he doesn\u2019t want to see Iraq broken into separate countries along sectarian lines. But he\u2019s also pushing for a new autonomous \u201cSunni regional government,\u201d which he said would be temporary. Once ISIS is defeated, he said, the final boundary lines of three provinces\u2014one Kurdish, one Sunni, and one Shiite\u2014-can be drawn.\n\nShawkat is eyeing his friends in Washington warily these days. \u201cHe\u2019s very concerned that the U.S. sees the Iranians as an ally to get rid of ISIS. That would be a major mistake,\u201d Shawkat\u2019s spokesperson, Whitley Bruner, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThis is a Sunni-on-Sunni fight.\u201d\n\nBruner, a former CIA operations officer and longtime Middle East hand, said that the commitments from the 1,700 officers and 10,000 soldiers to fight ISIS were real, and that Shawkat has also been looking for support among \u201cregional powers,\u201d whom he declined to name. Shawkat himself said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were two countries that could be helpful in acquiring weapons for the new militia, and indicated that U.S. approval of such a transaction would help to speed it along.\n\nShawkat is not an unknown entity in Washington. He was a senior leader in the Iraqi National Congress, a Hussein-opposition group that had bipartisan backing in the U.S. Congress and received funding from the CIA, the State Department, and the Pentagon. Shawkat insisted he was never a \u201cdeputy\u201d to the INC\u2019s notorious leader, Ahmed Chalabi, as has been widely reported. Shawkat was already running a group opposed to Hussein of his own in 2002 when he was brought together with Chalabi, he said, \u201cunder heavy persuasion of Department of State and Pentagon.\u201d They split in 2004, but remain on good terms, Shawkat said. \u201cDr. Chalabi remains a personal friend, but we differ on political matters and methodologies.\u201d\n\nDavid Mack, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who was once in charge of the U.S. government\u2019s interactions with Iraqi opposition forces, described Shawkat as a politically \u201cflexible\u201d man whose business acumen mirrored his political skills.\n\n\n\nMack said he met Shawkat in the spring of 1999, when Shawkat was living in exile in Vancouver. He\u2019d come to a large conference for Iraqi opposition groups in New York, and stood out as someone who \u201chad a good sense of the role the Iraqi private sector could play\u201d in efforts to prepare for a post-Hussein nation, Mack told The Daily Beast. \u201cHe\u2019s a entrepreneurial personality. Sometimes that makes for good politicians.\u201d\n\nThat also may have been what drew him to Chalabi. \u201cHe realized that one of the things he needed in the INC was a prominent Iraqi Sunni figure, and he eventually settled on Mudhar for that role,\u201d Mack said.\n\nBruner, Shawkat\u2019s current spokesman, was the man who first recruited Chalabi to work for the CIA, in 1991. That led to the formation of the INC, which later provided provided U.S. intelligence with information about Hussein\u2019s supposed weapons of mass destruction program\u2014intelligence that was later discredited. \u201cWithout Chalabi there would have been no war,\u201d journalist Aram Roston wrote in his book on the notorious Iraqi, The Man Who Pushed America to War.\n\nShawkat\u2019s connections to Chalabi may be the least of his challenges in persuading Washington that he\u2019s the right man to fight ISIS. That\u2019s because there are several Iraqi Sunnis making that claim, including at least three other individuals and groups who have hired lobbyists of their own in the past year, according to disclosure records. (There\u2019s also an effort underway to bankroll Iraq\u2019s Kurdish fighters, by Republican mega-donor Foster Friess.)\n\nOne of the Sunni players, Sheikh Abdalrazzaq Hatem al-Suleiman, a prominent tribal leader, met with members of Congress during a week-long visit in May. He also sat down with Royce, the House Armed Services Committee chair, with whom Shawkat met. At the State Department, Abdalrazzaq spoke with Brett McGurk, President Obama\u2019s special envoy to the international coalition to conquer ISIS.\n\nThe sheikh, who fled Iraq after ISIS destroyed his home in Anbar province and now lives in Jordan, leads a tribe of some 300,000 who are also prepared to fight the militants, Jonathan Greenhill, his representative in Washington, told The Daily Beast.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe sheikh is ready to produce his tribesmen now,\u201d said Greenhill, a former senior operations officer with the CIA.\n\nAfter his visit to Washington, Abdalrazzaq obtained a proclamation from the Al-Anbar Provincial Council in Iraq, supporting his plan to pull together Kurds and Shiites\u2014not backed by Iran\u2014and train them to fight ISIS, along with Iraqi Sunni fighters. Unlike Shawkat, the council is willing to work with the central government in Baghdad to train the fighters. The council\u2019s training plan also has the backing of the Obama administration.\n\nWhat\u2019s shaping up in Washington now may be a fight to see which of the various Sunni players has the best plan, or at least can undermine the others. Among the groups is another coalition of Sunni tribal chiefs, as well as prominent figures from Iraq\u2019s Nineveh province. If anything united them, it\u2019s their varying degrees of distrust of Baghdad and its Iranian allies.\n\n\u201cOver the past 12 years, by far more Sunnis have been killed by these Iranian-backed Shiite militias than by al Qaeda or ISIS combined, while the Iraqi central government turns a blind eye,\u201d Mark Alsalih, a prominent Sunni lobbyist in Washington and the president of the Iraq Stability and Security Program, composed of citizens and tribal sheikhs, told The Daily Beast.\n\nThe various groups want to strengthen their own hands while the Obama administration backs Abadi and leans on the central government to solve Iraq\u2019s problems and defeat ISIS\u2014hence the furious lobbying efforts of late by so many Sunnis. But all their work may reveal more about their various plans\u2019 weaknesses than their strengths, experts said.\n\n\u201cThe seemingly endless parade of Sunni leaders coming to Washington seeking arms and other support to equip bands of fighters speaks to two critical, reinforcing problems in Iraq today,\u201d Kenneth Pollack, a former CIA analyst who worked on Iran and Iraq military issues and is now a senior fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cFirst, the Sunni leadership is fragmented and lacks a unified command structure that could organize a fight against Da\u2019ish or conduct meaningful negotiations with Abadi,\u201d Pollack said, using an Arabic acronym for ISIS. \u201cSecond is the persistent sluggishness of the Iraqi government (and its U.S. allies) in arming and training willing Sunni fighters on their own.\u201d\n\nA kind of stalemate has ensued, Pollack said, with the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad arguing that it needs to take things slow, because the Sunnis that want arms are being led by \u201cfreelance leaders whose allegiance is unknown,\u201d and the Sunnis in terms demanding arms to \u201ccircumvent a government they believe is either unwilling or unable to lead the fight against Da\u2019ish in the Sunni heartland.\u201d\n\nIn the days when the U.S. forces were fighting and dying in Iraq against ISIS\u2019s predecessor, U.S. officials may have been more willing to roll the dice on some of these freelance leaders.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of tribal leaders and municipal leaders who have clout. And in the Bush era they all would have been taken rather seriously,\u201d Jonathan Schanzer, a former terrorism analyst with the Treasury Department and now the vice president for research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cRight now, my sense is that they are being viewed by the Obama White House as people who could drag America back into conflict or waste more of our treasure on a hopeless cause,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to them. But I think they need to somehow organize internally better before approaching this Congress and this White House.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Shawkat said he is planning to come back to Washington in the fall, hopefully as a witness at one, maybe two congressional hearings. There, he might have his best chance yet to pitch his war plan.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:21.254+0000"}

It wasn\u2019t just because President Obama\u2019s or Vice President Biden\u2019s absence was a horrendous gaffe. More than this, it demonstrated beyond argument that the Obama team lacks the basic instincts and judgment necessary to conduct U.S. national security policy in the next two years. It\u2019s simply too dangerous to let Mr. Obama continue as is\u2014with his current team and his way of making decisions. America, its allies, and friends could be heading into one of the most dangerous periods since the height of the Cold War.\n\nMr. Obama will have to excuse most of his inner core, especially in the White House. He will have to replace them with strong and strategic people of proven foreign policy experience. He\u2019ll also need to seed the Defense and State Departments with new top people serving directly as senior advisers to the secretaries. And he also will need to set up regular consultations\u2014not the usual phony ones\u2014with the two key Senate leaders in this field, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker and Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, two people who can really improve his decisions and bolster his credibility. Many will be tempted to dismiss these crash solutions as several bridges too far, as simply unrealistic. But hear me out. It can be made much more plausible than it seems at first blush.

I\u2019ve never proposed such a drastic overhaul. But if you think hard about how Mr. Obama and his team handled this weekend in Paris, I think you\u2019ll see I\u2019m not enjoying a foreign policy neurological breakdown.\n\nIt was an absolute no-brainer for either Mr. Obama or Mr. Biden personally to show the American flag on the streets of Paris. Of course every senior staff person should have recommended it three seconds after the news of the Parisian horrors. So far as we know, none did. Sure, this was an inexplicable and utter staff failure, but the president and the vice president shouldn\u2019t have required anyone to tell them what to do in this situation. It was, after all, about terrorism, the main issue of the era. If all these top officials blew this obvious decision, shudder at how they\u2019ll handle the hard ones.\n\nFirst, Mr. Obama will have to thank his senior National Security Council team and replace them. The must-gos include National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, chief speech writer/adviser Ben Rhodes, and foreign policy guru without portfolio Valerie Jarrett. They can all be replaced right away, and their successors won\u2019t require senatorial confirmation.\n\nMr. Obama will not be a lesser man but a greater man if he recognizes what\u2019s at stake and accepts the help he must have to ensure our survival.\n\nHere\u2019s who could succeed them and inspire great confidence immediately at home and abroad: first rate former top officials and proven diplomats Thomas Pickering, Winston Lord, and Frank Wisner; Republicans with sterling records like Robert Zoellick, Rich Armitage, Robert Kimmitt, and Richard Burt; or a rising young Democrat of proven ability and of demonstrated Cabinet-level quality, Michele Flournoy. Any one of them would make a huge difference from Day 1 in a top role. Others among them could be brought on to the NSC as senior advisers without portfolio to take the lead on specific problems. These are not just my personal opinions about these individuals; they are practically universal ones.\n\nThe State Department really needs help, too. Anthony Blinken, the new No. 2 there, is quite good and should stay. But Secretary of State John Kerry has been described even by the faithful in this administration as quixotic. Any of those mentioned above for the top NSC job could also serve as senior advisers without portfolio to Kerry and Blinken. But they would have to be given real access and authority. Even if they could only do their advising two or three days a week, these are the kind of people who carry most of the relevant information in their heads already, and their experience is unmatched.\n\nAshton Carter, the defense secretary to be, will be very strong and very good, but he too could use some senior national security/foreign policy advisers to help him through the long list of problems. Particularly good in this role would be Dov Zakheim, a Pentagon undersecretary in a Republican administration. He knows budgets and policy. Carter could also take aboard first rate retired military minds such as Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and Jack Keane, the former vice chief of staff of the Army.\n\nAnd Mr. Obama also has a great opportunity that he should try his best to pursue: establishing a genuine working relationship with two new senatorial power brokers. Bob Corker and John McCain really know their stuff and are very good heads. Nothing can stop McCain from going beyond acceptable limits of critiquing Mr. Obama, and if he\u2019s determined to do it so be it, but he has the knowledge and often the good instincts to really improve the president\u2019s defense policies. This can work only if McCain accepts that he is not president of the United States and commander in chief. At some point, he\u2019d have to be a team player as he has proved he can be. Corker is much more self-controlled and a very wise head on foreign policy. The more Americans get to know him in the coming years, the more this gem of a public servant will be recognized.\n\nFinally, Mr. Obama will need the usual wise men for regular informal consultation: Henry Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and James Baker.\n\nThese suggestions are all ad hoc and a bit helter-skelter. But no one can figure out how to make the present Obama team work, and I haven\u2019t heard other solutions.\n\nIn the end, making the national security system work comes down to one factor, one man\u2014Barack Obama. He\u2019s the key problem, and he\u2019s the only one who can bring about a solution. He\u2019s such a closed person. He\u2019s first rate as an intellectual thinker, but he thinks about problems as an intellectual and not as a policy maker and a leader. Alas, that\u2019s just too clear. He also doesn\u2019t like to be challenged with give and take. If he were to bring in the kind of people I suggest, he would have to resolve at the outset to give them a full hearing and tangible respect for their views.\n\nThe world\u2019s challenges to America today are not mere distractions from domestic priorities. They are gut challenges to our national security in the Middle East, with Russia and China, and with the terrorist threat inside and outside our borders. The terrorism and cyber warfare challenges in particular imperil our very survival.\n\nMr. Obama will not be a lesser man but a greater man if he recognizes what\u2019s at stake and accepts the help he must have to ensure our survival.

{"entityId": 1782, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Despite liberal ballot measures passing in several red states, Republicans won big this election\u2014and are planning to push through plenty of pet bills to restrict abortion and more.\n\nDuring his reelection campaign, Mitch McConnell pledged that if he became Senate majority leader, one of his priorities would be legislation to ban abortions after 20 weeks. \u201cIn a Republican Senate, under my leadership, we would have the kind of real debate on the issues that the American people want,\u201d McConnell told the National Right to Life Conference. Except polls show that seven in 10 Americans oppose limits on abortion access, and voters in Colorado and North Dakota roundly rejected such limits in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nMeanwhile, more than seven in 10 Americans support raising the federal minimum wage, and on Tuesday voters in four red states\u2014Alaska, Arkansas, South Dakota, and Nebraska\u2014passed minimum wage ballot measures by wide margins. But what has McConnell said about such obviously popular minimum wage hikes? \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be debating all these gosh darn proposals,\u201d McConnell said to an assembled group of billionaires in August. \u201cThat\u2019s all we do in the Senate is vote on things like raising the minimum wage,\u201d he said, complaining about Democratic leadership.\n\nIt appears likely that in McConnell\u2019s Senate, extremist legislation to undermine the basic rights of women will be prioritized while legislation to help women, who make up two-thirds of minimum-wage earners, will be pushed aside. After all, despite momentarily sounding ready to compromise post-election, by the end of the week it was clear Republicans had no plans to, for instance, work with White House to pass legislation that Republicans originally co-sponsored. Thus it seems likely that instead of striking a new tone of moderation, the new GOP Congress will return to its old tricks. So how else might Republicans use their newfound majority to advance their seemingly endless \u201cWar on Women\u201d?\n\n\u201cAnytime horse trading begins, we have to be vigilant about women in general and low-income women in particular often being the first to be sacrificed.\u201d\n\nAfter the 2010 midterm election in which Republicans won control of the House, one of the first bills they introduced was the \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,\u201d which would cement existing prohibitions on using any government money to fund an abortion\u2014and sought to impose further restrictions by narrowing the definition of rape in exceptions under the ban. A revised version of the law was introduced again as one of the first bills in 2013, this time without the redefinition of rape but with additional provisions to ban abortion coverage by any of the private insurance plans in the Obamacare exchanges and impose tax penalties on employers that do cover the cost of abortions. That version, HR 7, passed in the House.\n\nRepublicans have a host of other pet bills to restrict abortion access in the context of the new health-care legislation. The Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, aka PRENDA, which not coincidentally sounds just like the gay rights legislation ENDA, would ban sex-selective abortion. It\u2019s a problem, like voter fraud, that doesn\u2019t exist but which Republicans rail against to justify other ends, in this case to restrict abortion further. The Heartbeat Informed Consent Act would require that any ultrasound prior to an abortion be shown to the pregnant woman and force the medical provider to describe the fetus\u2019s heartbeat to the woman, free speech rights be damned. And the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act would require parental notification of abortion, regardless of the governing laws of each state. The law is co-sponsored by presidential hopeful Marco Rubio and\u2026Mitch McConnell.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. Federal family planning funding under Title X supplements the cost of birth control, family planning counseling, breast and cervical exams, HIV tests, and other reproductive health services for low-income families. Title X does not cover abortion care, yet for decades conservatives have been campaigning to gut it, in part because it supports Planned Parenthood clinics, which provide these vital basic health services but also provide abortions using entirely separate sources of funding. Indeed, Republican efforts to eliminate Planned Parenthood\u2019s Title X funding and gut aspects of Obamacare were at the center of the massive and costly 2013 Republican government shutdown.\n\n\n\nWhile McConnell promised in an interview following his reelection that \u201cThere is no possibility of a government shutdown\u201d under his leadership, he said in the same breath that he would use government appropriations bills to push the GOP agenda. \u201cAppropriations bills are going to have prescriptions of certain things that we think [Obama] ought not to be doing by either reducing funding or restricting funding,\u201d McConnell said. With that mind-set, it\u2019s hard not to anticipate more Republican efforts to hamstring Obamacare and Planned Parenthood, setting up the conditions for more ideologically driven shutdowns on the part of the right.\n\nIf Republicans continue to try to repeal or tinker with Obamacare\u2014despite 10 million Americans now receiving coverage thanks to the law and its increasingly popular impact, including in McConnell\u2019s own home state\u2014women\u2019s advocacy groups will be watching for attacks on the contraception mandate. \u201cAnytime horse trading begins, we have to be vigilant about women in general and low-income women in particular often being the first to be sacrificed,\u201d says Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America.\n\nAlong these lines, Republicans are likely to keep angling to gut Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security\u2014important for all seniors and low-income Americans but especially for women. And if there\u2019s a Supreme Court opening, Lord help us all. President Obama has already had enough trouble getting basic appointments of fair jurists through the Democratic Senate with Republicans putting constant procedural holds on appointments.\n\nOf course, the newly elected crop of Republicans could surprise us all and abandon their past fringe extremism, especially its \u201cWar on Women,\u201d and step up to the task of moderate governance the American people clearly want. After all, a candidate like Colorado Republican Sen.-Elect Cory Gardner ran away from his previous anti-abortion, pro-\u201cfetal personhood\u201d positions in his campaign. And among voters who backed Gardner, according to exit polls, 16 percent feel abortion should be \u201calways legal\u201d and 42 percent think it should be \u201cmostly legal.\u201d These voters\u2014not to mention those who backed Gardner\u2019s Democratic opponent\u2014don\u2019t want their new senator rushing off to Congress as a new general in the GOP\u2019s \u201cWar on Women.\u201d Gardner and other Republicans, especially those in purple states and districts, would be wise to be a moderating influence within a party that, if it can\u2019t show the ability to work with Democrats and govern responsibly, won\u2019t enjoy victory much more often. As is, exit polls show women voters nationwide still stood with Democrats this election, driven especially by black women and Latina voters. The Republican Party \u201cautopsy\u201d following the 2012 election called for the party to do better by women voters as well as voters of color. That prognosis still stands. And unless Republicans start pursuing very different priorities in Congress, that prognosis could sting.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tea Party voices in the GOP are still there, emboldened by the party\u2019s new power. And there are the likes of Rubio and Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, 2016 hopefuls incentivized to push pet ideological issues to woo Republican primary voters. What new legislative attacks on the basic rights and opportunities of women might they put on the table? Women\u2019s advocates are afraid even to speculate, lest they give the Republicans any ideas. \u201cI\u2019m afraid enough of the things they\u2019ve actually said they\u2019ll do,\u201d says Jess McIntosh, communications director of Emily\u2019s List.\n\nThis election, says NARAL\u2019s Hogue, \u201cthe majority of voters were not electing anyone to restrict our fundamental freedoms but to expand opportunity in our country.\u201d Let\u2019s hope Republicans got that message.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:22.048+0000"}

Bush, than he might want to acknowledge. Like Bush, Obama is convinced of the righteousness of his own judgment, and lets all of us know it.\n\nWhile Republicans accuse Obama of everything from being crypto-Muslim to foreign-born to committing high crimes and misdemeanors, the reality is that Obama is running American foreign policy from a watered-down version of the Bush playbook. Drones, check; NSA surveillance, check; overreach, check.\n\nIf the rap on Bush 43 was that he wanted to be policeman to the world, Obama seems to have the same ambition\u2014only to do it on the cheap. Bush failed at his \u201cmission accomplished\u201d while spending a lot of money; Obama is failing while spending less.\n\nYes, Obama presided over the withdrawal American forces from Iraq, and announced a timetable for their pullout from Afghanistan. Still, he seeks to project U.S. force around the globe, regardless of priority or magnitude of crisis, as if our military was a hybrid of cops and Hessians. No matter seems too small for Obama\u2019s attention, even if the upside for America is negligible or nonexistent.\n\nTake the Middle East as an example. In Libya, he sought to lead from behind, only to see our embassy in Benghazi sacked by jihadists. In Syria he made chemical weapons a \u201cred line,\u201d and then folded in the face of public outcry and congressional opposition. At no time did Obama lay out what America\u2019s vital interest might be in either hot spot. But it didn\u2019t end there.\n\nMore recently, Secretary of State John Kerry wasted his time and prestige in a futile shuttle between Jerusalem and Ramallah in another failed attempt to broker a peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Kerry\u2019s quest was as much rooted in reality as W\u2019s dream of grafting a secular democracy upon a religiously riven Iraq, or transforming the Arab world into something it isn\u2019t and may never be.\n\nIraq is in chaos as radical Sunnis march toward Baghdad, and American ships move into position to strike. Meanwhile, Syria has transformed itself from a dictatorship into a murderous cesspool, while Palestinians are kidnapping Israeli teenagers, and Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset, elected an opponent of the \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d as the country\u2019s president. In other words, it\u2019s the same Middle East, only worse.\n\nTo top it off, an American drone might kill a Sunni militant who was seeking to topple the Iranian-backed Shia-led Iraqi regime. But, if that same Sunni rebel turned westward to Syria he\u2019d be\u2014armed with American weapons\u2014to take on Syria\u2019s Iranian-backed government.\n\nYet despite the region living up to its reputation, some things have changed here at home for the better. In 2013 the United States produced enough energy to satisfy 84 percent of its needs, a huge jump from its historic 2005 low, according to a report issued by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Energy output rose 18 percent from 2005 to 2013, while our energy use dropped 2.7 percent. In other words, we are not as vulnerable to the whims of sheiks, mullahs, and deranged holy men as we once were.\n\nMore and more of our energy is saying \u201cmade in the USA.\u201d Shale gas and fracking have made the difference. In practical terms, that means fewer Americans need to die to secure our foreign energy pipelines, and like it or not, dependence on foreign oil has been a driver of our recent wars, especially since the downfall of the Soviet Union.\n\nYet the Obama administration has been doing its best to block this energy renaissance, in the name of \u201cclimate change.\u201d It\u2019s almost enough to make one think that it prefers the good old days, when American policymakers were preoccupied with the Middle East as an energy hub, thus justifying any number of military adventures\u2014and misadventures.\n\nFortunately, the American public may be imposing needed restraints upon Washington, and the itch to pull on a trigger wherever and whenever trouble arises. According to CBS, more than three in five Americans opposed intervention in Syria. In recent Republican congressional primaries, the rank-and-file has voted \u201cno\u201d to reflexive interventionism. There\u2019s a reason John McCain never became president.\n\nLast week, outgoing House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a war hawk, was upended in a surprise primary loss. Significantly, Cantor\u2019s loss was not the first of its kind. Last month incumbent North Carolina Congressman Walter Jones turned back a well-funded challenge from Bush \u201943 alumnus Taylor Griffin (not the NBA star). Jones\u2019 sins were his belated opposition to the Iraq War, coupled with his opposition to going at Iran. To Bushworld, Jones was a heretic.\n\nTellingly, Cantor and Griffin received more financial support from outside their home states than within. Federal Election Commission reports for both men are littered with D.C. and New York ZIP codes. What Wall Street and K Street want, Wall Street and K Street do not necessarily get.\n\nHeading toward 2016, Iraq raises questions for Republicans and Democrats alike. For Jeb Bush it means answering the question of whether his brother made a mistake in invading Iraq. For Hillary Clinton it means answering the questions of whether she was she wrong in boasting about the end of al Qaeda and for pushing for the United States to take a more active role in Libya. For Democrats it means answering whether their opposition to coal and Keystone XL is harming our national security.\n\nFaced with a Middle East in flames, Republicans would do well to hold extensive hearings on what was the president is thinking and hold the administration\u2019s feet to the fire. The Democrats can respond, of course, that it was Bush\u2019s fault, and they would be right. But strictly speaking, that\u2019s not the contemporary GOP\u2019s problem\u2014unless, of course, it chooses to take on the defense of Bush\u2019s actions of 10 years ago as part of its mandate.

It\u2019s caught on the wrong side of the economic populist wave.\n\nIs the war on women\u2014or on women\u2019s groups, anyway\u2014coming to the Democratic Party, too?\n\nWith economic issues increasingly roiling the progressive left, a number of bloggers, activists, and liberal groups say EMILY\u2019s List, one of the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest power brokers for nearly 30 years, is increasingly on the wrong side of the political divide. Dedicated to electing pro-choice Democratic women, the group has helped expand their number in the U.S. Senate from zero in 1985 to 16 today, while a record 62 Democratic women serve in the House of Representatives. But progressive critics say EMILY\u2019s list is backing female candidates regardless of conservative economic leanings; in some cases, this has meant backing women who are not even as strong on issues of reproductive rights as their male opponents.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a crucial juncture in American politics, with economic populists fighting to take our country back from corporations and lobbyists and the politicians they fund,\u201d said Laura Friedenbach, a spokeswoman for the Progressive Campaign Change Committee, which works to elect liberal Democrats to Congress and has sparred often with EMILY\u2019s List over the past several election cycles. \u201cThe Elizabeth Warren wing of American politics is ascendant\u2014and when groups like EMILY\u2019s List are part of helping us win more seats for populist progressives, we\u2019re happy to work with them.\u201d\n\nBut the list of races where EMILY\u2019s List has fought the PCCC and other liberal groups is long. There was the open congressional race in Hawaii this year, in which EMILY\u2019s List backed a candidate who voted against legalizing same-sex marriage and raising the minimum wage and had courted evangelical Christian groups in her time in the Hawaii legislature. There was the Pennsylvania governor\u2019s race, where EMILY\u2019s List backed Allyson Schwartz, who became a target of liberal groups like PCCC and Democracy for America for heading a group of centrist Democrats that wanted to cut Social Security. They point to mayoral races in 2013 in New York and Los Angeles, where EMILY\u2019s List backed business-friendly women over male candidates who ran with substantial union support and who made addressing economic inequalities central to their campaigns.\n\nThe conflict between broad-based progressive groups and EMILY\u2019s List has been simmering for years, but liberals say it has heated up over the past several election cycles as the divisions within the party have grown. The most galling example, liberals say, was this year\u2019s Democratic Senate primary in Hawaii, when EMILY\u2019s List supported Rep. Colleen Hanabusa over incumbent Sen. Brian Schatz, even though Schatz has been hailed as a new progressive champion with a spotless record on abortion issues. Hanabusa lost the August primary by a narrow margin.\n\n\u201cI think EMILY\u2019s List has really lost their way,\u201d said Karen Chun, a prominent Hawaii-based progressive activist and blogger. \u201cHere in Hawaii they seem to not understand the politics. Brian Schatz has been a 100 percent down the line supporter of women\u2019s issues. I understand their rule is that they only endorse women, but they don\u2019t have to endorse at all when they have a champion running who is a man.\u201d\n\nIn a conservative state, a candidate like Hanabusa would be a perfectly reasonable choice, Chun said, but in a liberal state like Hawaii, there is no reason for progressives to settle.\n\n\u201cThey are actually being counterproductive. You can\u2019t assume that a woman by virtue of her gender is automatically going to be the better candidate, or even be pro-choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do believe in getting women into office,\u201d she said. \u201cI strongly support women\u2019s issues, but they are actually being counterproductive. You can\u2019t assume that a woman by virtue of her gender is automatically going to be the better candidate, or even be pro-choice.\u201d\n\nEMILY\u2019s List was founded in 1985, when only two women were serving in the U.S. Senate, both Republicans. Its name is an acronym for Early Money Is Like Yeast\u2014it makes the dough rise\u2014and the operating theory was that female candidates could close the fundraising gap that they often face if they were able to show that they had substantial financial backing.\n\nIn the years since, however, the Democratic Party has largely coalesced around issues of abortion rights, but the division over economic issues has grown. Progressives say they would like to see EMILY\u2019s List expand its notion of \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d to include not just reproductive rights but issues of economic security, pointing out that women would benefit most from a higher minimum wage and expanded Social Security, as many progressive candidates, regardless of gender, are championing.\n\n\u201cObviously it is important to have women\u2019s voices in the room when policy decisions are being made, and we have a substantial way to go on that, but in a Democratic primary, the biggest debate is going to be between the Elizabeth Warren wing and the establishment wing,\u201d said Robert Borosage, the president and founder of Campaign for America\u2019s Future. \u201cAnd their screen doesn\u2019t take those distinctions into account. They are explicit about that, that they aren\u2019t on the progressive side.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for EMILY\u2019s List disputed the notion that the group is increasingly out of step with the liberal energy of the Democratic Party, pointing out a number of races where it was aligned with progressive activists and noting that it was among liberal hero Elizabeth Warren\u2019s earliest champions.\n\n\u201cThe progressive movement knows how critical adding more Democratic women to our government is,\u201d said spokeswoman Jess McIntosh. \u201cWith Republicans\u2019 biggest vulnerabilities coming around women\u2019s issues and with women voters, it is even more critical that we put more progressive women at the table to hold them accountable and work for change.\u201d\n\nBy lining up behind pro-choice women, EMILY\u2019s List is likely also to line up behind progressive candidates, and it is rare that its aims do not dovetail with that of liberal groups.\n\n\u201cWe have two very compatible set of goals, but different sets of goals,\u201d said Neil Sroka, a spokesman for Democracy for America, which has found itself on the opposing side of EMILY\u2019s List in recent years. \u201cWe are focused on electing progressives to office, and they are focused on electing pro-choice women. It\u2019s a Venn diagram, and there is a big swath of women in the middle.\u201d\n\nAlthough some progressives would like EMILY\u2019s List to alter its criteria for endorsements to include factors behind gender and reproductive rights, others say the group could simply make better decisions about where it spends its resources. Why, they ask, should the group get involved in places where there already is a progressive Democratic incumbent running, even if that incumbent is male, as was the case this year in Hawaii and has been true in other races around the country? They point as well to progressive female candidates who could have benefited from a more robust involvement by EMILY\u2019s List, including Shenna Bellows, running for U.S. Senate in Maine, and Amanda Curtis, running for U.S. Senate in Montana.\n\n\u201cThe part I don\u2019t get about their decision-making is how they decide which races to target,\u201d said Mike Lux, a Washington, D.C-based progressive political consultant. \u201cThey don\u2019t get involved in every race, and for some of these races, they could easily see what other progressive allies are doing and be willing to back up.\u201d\n\nLori Salda\u00f1a was one candidate who says she could have benefited from more EMILY\u2019s List support. A self-described \u201cchampion of choice,\u201d she squared off unsuccessfully in 2012 against the more conservative Democrat Scott Peters in California\u2019s 52nd Congressional District. And although EMILY\u2019s List backed her, it did so only half-heartedly, she says, because she could not raise enough money.\n\n\u201cIt was all about the money: What you could bring in on your own before they would help you out at their end,\u201d she said.\n\nSaldana said that in one conversation with EMILY\u2019s List officials, they pointed to the gangbuster fundraising that Christie Vilsack, the wife of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, was doing in her congressional race in Iowa.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018OK, I am not married to a Cabinet member. I would love to do a fundraiser in Washington, but I don\u2019t have those connections,\u2019\u201d Salda\u00f1a said.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even say they supported me. Everything was met with resistance because we weren\u2019t wealthy enough.\n\n\u201cTo me,\u201d Salda\u00f1a added, \u201cIt\u2019s the old 99 percent argument.

It\u2019s fine to point that out. But point up the fact that he\u2019s a registered Republican? That\u2019s where I draw the line, friends. I mean, come on. That\u2019s just a coincidence. Total cosmic coincidence.\n\nJust like it\u2019s a coincidence that that one black comic, a Barack Obama impersonator, was yanked offstage at an official Republican Party meeting in 2011 for telling a series of racially themed jokes. I mean, that could easily have happened at a Democratic\u2014well, maybe not. But still. A coincidence. Just like it\u2019s a coincidence that one federal judge who sent an email around to friends saying that Obama\u2019s father was a dog happened to be a Republican. Complete and utter accident of fate, the puny matter of his voter enrollment.\n\nThose rancidly racist T-shirts and posters one sometimes sees at Tea Party rallies? They\u2019re just a coincidence, too. I mean, Tea Party people might not be Republican, strictly speaking, and it\u2019s totally unfair to assume that! OK, Tea Party candidates run in Republican primaries, not Democratic ones, and the Tea Party caucus in the House doesn\u2019t include one Democrat. But still. Guilt by association!\n\nBundy has a broad libertarian streak, too. But please, let\u2019s not suggest that libertarian-leaning Republicans might be a little racist, too. I mean, again, what\u2019s the evidence for such a statement? What\u2014the fact that Ron Paul\u2019s ghostwriter(s) of his newsletters in the 1990s had very clear Confederate sympathies? If I were you, I would be careful about drawing any inferences from that. It was a long time ago. And a sentence like this one: \u201cOrder was only restored in L.A. when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks three days after rioting began\u201d ...well, admit it. It\u2019s open to ambiguity. Can be interpreted in any number of ways.\n\nWhat\u2019s that? You counter by telling me that all that was two decades ago? OK. You\u2019re right. And you\u2019re right that it\u2019s also a coincidence that his son Rand\u2019s ghostwriter\u2014that\u2019s Rand Paul, the current Republican front-runner to be the party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2016\u2014on his book also has expressed sympathetic views about the Confederacy? Remember this guy\u2014called himself the Southern Avenger, was photographed wearing a stars and bars superhero kind of mask? It\u2019s just a coincidence that he ended up in Rand Paul\u2019s orbit.\n\nReally. Stop taking these little things out of context and acting like they constitute a pattern. They just don\u2019t. OK? The pattern liberals ought to be worried about is the following one.\n\nReally. Stop taking these little things out of context and acting like they constitute a pattern. They just don\u2019t. OK?\n\nA century ago, or more, it was the Democratic Party that was playing footsie with the Ku Klux Klan. Even worse\u2014the Klan, in the Deep South anyway, was almost an arm of the Democratic Party. Sure, it was a century ago, and the parties have completely flipped identities since then, but so what? I still don\u2019t hear an answer! That\u2019s No. 1.\n\nNo. 2: Robert Byrd was in the KKK! That it was 60 years ago and that he recanted 40 years ago and that he hasn\u2019t been a truly leading Democrat since 30 years ago and that he\u2019s dead now, well, none of those things matter. Robert Byrd was in the KKK! This one fact will blot the Democratic escutcheon forever.\n\nAnd No. 3: Everett Dirksen passed the Civil Rights Act, pal. Not Lyndon Johnson. Not Speaker John McCormack, not Majority Leader Mike Mansfield. They were all Democrats, you see, and they were compromised, polluted by the racists in their party. But Dirksen, the pure Dirksen. He made it all happen; the deus ex machina of the whole thing. Those people who point out that the Southern racists moved to the GOP, and that today\u2019s GOP would have no room for the likes of a Dirksen\u2026 I have one sentence for them: Bobby Byrd was in the KKK!\n\nSo really. Go after Bundy all you want. He\u2019s deplorable, just like Sean Hannity said. But the idea that he represents anything? That others of similar circumstance might have views anything like his on racial matters? Shame on you. That he\u2019s an enrolled Republican is, again, just a coincidence. Everything. The signs. The emails. The jokes. The ghostwriters. They\u2019re all just coincidences.

{"entityId": 1786, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The president has always given off the sense that he doesn\u2019t love the business of politics. So is Supreme Court justice a natural next step for him?\n\nWith the recent midterm results and his equally disastrous poll numbers, it\u2019s hard to believe that President Obama hasn\u2019t at least daydreamed about having another less demanding, less thankless job. And with two Supreme Court decisions on the horizon that could undo some of his most significant presidential legacies, it is even harder to believe he hasn\u2019t daydreamed about one job in particular: being a Supreme Court Justice.\n\nHis clashes with Congress and increasing isolation seem to make it abundantly clear that President Barack Obama would rather play just about any game\u2014including, or perhaps especially, golf\u2014than politics. Yet he happens to have picked a line of work in which playing politics, or politicking as some call it, is just as much a part of the job requirements, as signing, or vetoing, a piece of legislation. So would President Barack Obama have been happier on the nation\u2019s highest court than in the nation\u2019s most recognizable house?\n\n\u201cI love the law, intellectually,\u201d Obama said in a recent interview with The New Yorker, before saying \u201cbeing a Justice is a little bit too monastic for me.\u201d And yet that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he might have ultimately had a greater impact on the issues he cares about as a member of the Supreme Court\u2014and that being a justice might be a more natural fit with who he is as a person.\n\nEvery president hopes to have at least one signature accomplishment or issue his administration can be remembered for. President Obama was poised to have two: healthcare reform and significant advancement on LGBT rights, specifically same-sex marriage. But after a surprising vote from Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to give the Affordable Care Act a reprieve in 2012, the Court is now planning to review another key portion of the law, with a ruling scheduled to come down by June 2015. That ruling could leave millions of those currently benefiting from Obamacare without the necessary subsidies to stay insured, and set the groundwork for a larger dismantling of the law.\n\nLast week, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld bans on same sex marriage in four states, making it extremely likely the Supreme Court will soon decide that issue as well. From becoming the first sitting President to embrace same-sex marriage, to repealing \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d, to using executive action to extend a host of federal benefits to same-sex couples, there are few issues that the Obama administration has been as heavily invested in terms of the President\u2019s political capital than LGBT rights.\n\nAnd yet, ultimately, the Supreme Court holds the power to uphold or undo what it has taken him years to accomplish.\n\nIt certainly cannot be an easy pill to swallow, working so hard to get to the White House only to find out that, despite what everyone tells all of us from the time we are children, the president actually isn\u2019t the most powerful man in America. That title belongs to nine men and women who were not elected but whose word is, for lack of a better term, king.\n\n\u201cHe's still a relatively young man in judicial terms and could follow in the tradition of William Howard Taft.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps even more daunting for the President, and his supporters, is the fact that one of the greatest orators to ever occupy the White House seems to lack the personality for the job.\n\nLet me be clear, as the president would say: Obama is telegenic and charming. (In one of the moments I chatted briefly with him he made a quip about my work that my mother still quotes to this day.) But it is clear he is not a man who is interested in having beers with people he is not genuinely interested in interacting with. He is the guy who hates small talk at large parties solely for the sake of networking, but would probably talk the ear off of a writer he admires at a small dinner party. That personality is not conducive to getting things done in Washington, at least not the Washington of today.\n\nIn his book The Center Holds: Obama and his Enemies, Jonathan Alter devotes an entire chapter to the president\u2019s lack of love for one of politics\u2019 most cherished pastimes: schmoozing. \u201cNo doubt President Obama is definitely less comfortable schmoozing than President Clinton was,\u201d Keith Boykin, a CNBC Contributor who worked in the Clinton White House and was a law school classmate of President Obama\u2019s told me. But he also added, \u201cFrom my recollection in the Clinton administration, the White House can be very isolating for any president, even those who are very sociable by nature.\u201d\n\nDespite Obama\u2019s schmooze-aversion, Alter argues that the president\u2019s own record indicates he might not fare quite so comfortably on the Supreme Court. Alter noted that during his days as a law professor at the University of Chicago, \u201cInstead of settling in as a professor\u2014and he could have easily won tenure\u2014he chose to stay a part-time lecturer so he could run for elective office and be a politician. During that time, he didn\u2019t write a single scholarly law review article, only political pieces or book reviews for local publications.\u201d\n\nHe also said the President disliked being 1 of 100 in the Senate, and would go batty \u201cbeing cooped up in the Supreme Court, which is a bad place for a restless guy like him.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not beyond the realm of possibility that he could one day have a chance to find out how Obama would fair as a Justice. And there is a precedent: William Howard Taft became Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court eight years after failing to be re-elected to a second term as president.\n\n\u201cI think President Obama would make an excellent Supreme Court justice,\u201d Boykin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late. He\u2019s still a relatively young man in judicial terms and could follow in the tradition of William Howard Taft. President Hillary Clinton could appoint him to the Supreme Court if she wanted to do so.\u201d\n\nBut, of course, President Clinton confirming a Justice Obama might require electing a far different Congress than the one President Obama has struggled to work with.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:25.405+0000"}
{"entityId": 1787, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Republican presidential candidates have a lot to answer for regarding their shameful record on voting rights. Here are some questions for Thursday\u2019s GOP debate.\n\nTO: Megyn Kelly, Bret Bauer, and Chris Wallace\n\n\n\nRE: Thursday's Republican Debate\n\n\n\nHey guys, I know you\u2019re frantically preparing for Thursday night\u2019s debate extravaganza, but I wanted to remind you that August 6 is also the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act becoming law. It provides a good hook to press the candidates to explain their views on voter IDs and other efforts which Democrats and also nonpartisan institutes claim suppress the votes of African Americans, the elderly, and students.\n\nYou could start the questioning with Scott Walker, since Wisconsin\u2019s voter photo ID law was one of the first pieces of legislation that Governor Walker signed into law in 2011, and it became a model many other states followed. It required that potential voters show a current or expired driver\u2019s license, or some form of military identification, or a U.S. passport, or a signed and dated student ID from an accredited state college or university, or a recent certificate of nationalization. If voters had none of these documents, they could present a birth certificate to receive a special photo ID issued by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. Such requirements made voting extremely arduous for the very people who disproportionately supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, such as racial minorities, students, and the elderly.\n\nFor example, there was the case of Gladys Butterfield, who had voted in every local, state, and presidential election since 1932. She had stopped driving decades ago, so she had no license. Her birth certificate was also missing. Her baptismal record was not acceptable as proof of identity in Wisconsin. Therefore, under the new law, she had to obtain a special government ID available only at a Department of Transportation (DOT) office before she could vote in the next presidential election. She was wheelchair bound so was dependent on a family member to drive her. (She could not apply online because she lacked a current license.) A quarter of the offices were open only one day a month and closed on weekends. Sauk City\u2019s office was perhaps the hardest to visit: in 2012 it was only open four days that entire year. Many other states\u2019 DOT offices posed similar problems: odd schedules, distance from public transportation, and the like.\n\nWith her daughter Gail\u2019s help, Butterfield applied for a state-certified birth certificate, costing $20, which she could show as proof of American citizenship. Next she had to visit the DOT. Transporting a wheelchair was difficult as was the inevitable wait in line to fill out the forms and have her picture taken. She was charged $28 because she did not know that it would not have cost her a cent if she had explicitly requested a free voter ID. DOT officials were instructed not to offer applicants a free ID unless applicants requested one. (When an outraged government employee emailed friends of the news and encouraged them to \u201cTELL ANYONE YOU KNOW!! EVEN IF THEY DON\u2019T NEED THE FREE ID, THEY MAY KNOW SOMEONE THAT DOES!!,\u201d he was abruptly fired.)\n\nLike the elderly, students who wanted to vote in the next election would find new obstacles when they again tried to vote in Wisconsin and many other states.\n\n\u201cMy mother is fortunate that she has someone to take her through this vote suppression procedure,\u201d Gail Butterfield Bloom told a journalist in 2011. \u201cHow many elderly or disabled residents do not? Are Scott Walker and his followers making it difficult for the elderly, disabled, poor and young to vote? My mother thinks so.\u201d\n\nSo too, perhaps, did the 178,000 other Wisconsin seniors who did not have a driver\u2019s license or a state photo ID. They would have to go through similar efforts to exercise their constitutional rights. Sadly, Gladys Butterfield passed away before she could vote in 2012. Does Governor Walker still support voter IDs despite the fact that even George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department found almost no evidence of illegal voting which would have been prevented by voter IDs?\n\nLike the elderly, students who wanted to vote in the next election would find new obstacles when they again tried to vote in Wisconsin and many other states. Under Wisconsin\u2019s new law, student IDs would be accepted as proof of identity only if they contained a signature and an expiration date. But in 2011 the cards carried by Wisconsin\u2019s 182,000 students were not signed or dated and, therefore, would not be accepted at the polls.\n\nLast year, the legislature also cut back on early voting hours during the workweek and stopped them completely on weekends, thereby destroying opportunities to vote used predominately by African Americans.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a question for Senator Ted Cruz: Your state quickly enacted new laws soon after the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision, Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted the Voting Rights Act. The state\u2019s strict voter ID law is now in the hands of a judge who will decide its fate. Does Senator Cruz side with the plaintiffs who want to expand the voting pool or the state\u2019s attorney who wishes to limit it?\n\nAnd finally you could quiz Governor Jeb Bush about the electoral mismanagement that put his brother in the White House in 2000. Reporter Ari Berman believes that the mix-up which led to the disenfranchisement of many qualified voters cost Al Gore the presidency.\n\nHave fun!\n\nGary May is not employed by Fox News.

His campaign signs were not the standard issue rectangles, but nearly half a billboard, taking up the better part of the Providence yards of any homeowners enthusiastic enough to plant them.\n\nAs he was greeting voters today, Elorza, who began the race as a virtual unknown, said that his message of \u201chonest government and a new direction\u201d was set to carry the day.\n\nAsked if he thought Cianci could provide \u201chonest government,\u201d Elorza nearly doubled over with laughter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.

Exactly. If you\u2019ve never heard of Representative Jeff Duncan, you\u2019re not alone. The former banker and auctioneer isn\u2019t well known outside his conservative South Carolina district. But Republicans running for president know Duncan as a man who is quietly emerging as an unlikely yet crucial figure in the process to pick the Republican nominee for 2016.\n\nIn South Carolina this past weekend, more than a dozen Republicans from across the country paraded across the stage of the \u201cFreedom Summit\u201d in downtown Greenville, assuring the Chick-Fil-A-fed crowd they are looking at the Next Conservative President of the United States. And a big part of why they\u2019re here is to impress this obscure third-term congressman.\n\nSouth Carolina hosts the first primary in the South, and is a key bellwether for grassroots conservative support. Since the birth of the modern primary system, only one Republican candidate\u2014Mitt Romney\u2014has lost the state and then gone on to win the nomination. And not only does Duncan\u2019s 3rd Congressional district include the I-85 corridor and the richest source of conservative votes in the state, Duncan himself has become a kind of folk hero to Tea Party activists. He was named the most conservative congressman in America by the influential Heritage Action, and is among the handful of GOP members to vote against John Boehner for Speaker not once, but twice.\n\nDuncan co-hosted the South Carolina Freedom Summit with Citizens United, which attracted 2,000 activists on Saturday, and hosts his own \u201cFaith and Freedom BBQ\u201d fundraiser every August, a sort of \u201cTom Harkin Iowa Steak Fry\u201d without all the steaks and liberals. Duncan\u2019s BBQ drew Senator Marco Rubio and 1,400 locals to his upstate district last year and is a already hot ticket for potential speakers going into next year\u2019s presidential primaries.\n\nHow did Duncan, the one-time walk-on for the Clemson University football team who readily admits he saw no playing time, become one of the biggest gets in the race to the White House for the 20-something Republicans who say they want the job?\n\nDuncan himself didn\u2019t offer much insight at first.\n\n\u201cTo be friends with Jeff Duncan, you\u2019re not going to get any further to the right than that. It\u2019s a great place for him to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo see my name on all these banners is sort of humbling because it\u2019s not something I seek out,\u201d he said in an interview across the hall from the stage that was festooned with 20-foot \u201cRep. Jeff Duncan\u201d banners and signs. But in the same breath he referred to himself as an \u201cunabashed\u201d conservative, and that seems to be the point for the audience, a crucial block of potential GOP primary voters in the second-in-the-nation primary state, and the marquee candidates looking for his time and advice.\n\n\u201cWhether the candidates seek me out, I\u2019m not looking for that,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cIf they do, they do, and I don\u2019t mind telling them what it\u2019s going to take to win as a conservative in South Carolina.\u201d\n\nHe ticks off \u201cleadership,\u201d \u201cvision,\u201d \u201cAmerican exceptionalism,\u201d and \u201cinspiration\u201d on the list of qualities he and his fellow South Carolina conservatives will be looking for, but not electability.\n\n\u201cWe want a winner, of course. We want to make sure we can pick someone who can win over the Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I hear the term \u2018electability\u2019 I kind of scrunch my nose up a little bit and go, really? They say, \u2018Ted Cruz can\u2019t win.\u2019 Really? Have you talked to Ted?\u201d\n\nDuncan has. He\u2019s talked to a number of the other hopefuls, too, including Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, and Mike Huckabee, who called Duncan at home last weekend to say his granddaughter\u2019s 3rd birthday would keep him away from the Freedom Summit, but he promised to be in South Carolina soon, which he was.\n\nHow about Jeb Bush? \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to Jeb,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to talk about him.\u201d\n\nIf Bush plans to make a play in the state, Duncan would be a good place to start his courtesy calls. Along with Senator Tim Scott, the wildly popular senator based in Charleston who was once Duncan\u2019s roommate in Washington, activists and GOP operatives increasingly point to Duncan as the man to meet.\n\n\u201cJeff Duncan\u2019s got the golden stamp,\u201d said Dave Woodard, Duncan\u2019s former professor at Clemson who also eventually became his pollster. \u201cTo be friends with Jeff Duncan, you\u2019re not going to get any further to the right than that. It\u2019s a great place for him to be.\u201d\n\nFor a party whose base has marched to the right in the last eight years, only to see accused squishes emerge as their nominees for president, the next GOP candidate claiming to be \u201cseverely conservative\u201d is going to need a few good character witnesses. And Duncan is the perfect guy to vouch for you in a state where three out of five likely primary voters call themselves born-again Christians.\n\nDuncan\u2019s friends know he\u2019s not the sort of flashy extrovert who makes headlines in politics, but even his old foes say there\u2019s more to Duncan than meets the eye.\n\nAlan Ray, now a South Carolina adviser to Senator Ted Cruz, ran one of the six Republican campaigns for the open House seat that Duncan eventually won in 2010.\n\n\u201cIn terms of an endorsement a campaign would be looking for, obviously Rep.

The overall jobs number was great at 288,000, and the unemployment rate was down to 6.1 percent.

Notice first that I wrote \u201chas the economy created\u201d rather than \u201cdid Obama create/did Bush create.\u201d I think it\u2019s a better description of reality.\n\nI also should note that I just measured the numbers under each president\u2014I gave Bush the numbers from January 2001 to December 2008, and Obama the numbers from January 2009 to the present, with the following asterisk. January 2009 was when Obama became president, but he didn\u2019t start until the 20th, of course. That was a particularly awful month, with 798,000 jobs lost. So I think it\u2019s reasonable to give Bush, whose policies helped cause the meltdown anyway, two-thirds of that 798,000. (January 2001, by the way, was a tiny number, 30,000 jobs lost, but just to be consistent, I assigned only 10,000 of those to Bush.)\n\nImagine that a Republican president produced 45 straight months of job growth coming off the worst financial crisis since the Depression. Lord, we\u2019d never hear the end of it.\n\nHere are Bush\u2019s numbers: It\u2019s 8.657 million jobs gained, and 7.121 million jobs lost, for a net job-creation number of 1.536 million. Pathetic. It\u2019s interesting to look back over the numbers from 2001. The economy stank. The month of 9/11, we lost 242,000 jobs. Want to ascribe that just to the attacks? In August, we\u2019d lost 158,000. The decent Bush years were 2004, 2005, 2006, and part of 2007, but even then the numbers were hoppy and inconsistent: 307,000 jobs added in May 2004 and just 74,000 in June, for instance.\n\nAnd what about Obama\u2019s numbers? I\u2019d betting that even if you\u2019re an Obama partisan, you think they\u2019re not all that different from Bush\u2019s. After all, 2009 was miserable: minus 798,000, minus 701,000, minus 826,000, and so on. The numbers went into the black in early 2010, but dipped back into the red in the summer. But remember, since October 2010, every report has been positive\u2014the now 45 straight months of job growth that the president and his team, to little avail, crow about.\n\nBut they\u2019ve added up, because under Obama, the economy has added 9.425 million jobs and lost 4.887, for a net gain of 4.538 million jobs. That\u2019s a 3 million advantage over Bush. Now, 6.5 million jobs doesn\u2019t put Obama up there in Clinton (22 million) and Reagan (around 16 million) territory. But remember\u2014he has 30 months to go yet. Let\u2019s say we average a gain of 250,000 a month the rest of the way. That\u2019s another 7.5 million. And that would edge him up toward Reagan territory. And that seems conservative, if anything. If the recovery gets genuinely humming, we could start seeing months between 300,000 and 400,000 next year. It seems unlikely to happen, but God would it be hilarious if Obama, with everything the Republicans in Congress have done to keep the economy in a state of contraction, ended up surpassing Reagan.\n\n[UPDATE: I rechecked my math this morning, and it's a good thing I did. I had originally given Obama nearly 2 million more jobs created than the actual numbers reflect. Obviously, I want to be accurate here. I added and re-added these three times.]\n\nBut all that\u2019s speculative. After all, there could be a recession coming, too, though most experts don\u2019t seem to fear that much. So let\u2019s just talk about the up to now, the 6.5 million net jobs. As I said before, I bet you didn\u2019t know that. Why?\n\nTwo main reasons. One, the administration doesn\u2019t go a great job of trumpeting it, and I think for good reason. Officials may feel constrained from doing too much boasting because a lot of people\u2019s perception and experience is still worse than that. A lot of these aren\u2019t great jobs, and the economy is still only doing real well for the top 5 or 10 percent.\n\nThe second reason is that figures on the broad left simply aren\u2019t superficial cheerleaders. The two men who are probably the most influential economic voices on the left, Paul Krugman and Robert Reich, have both been pretty harsh critics of the administration\u2019s economic policies, as have other liberal economists. They, and less well-known but still prominent people such as Dean Baker, look at the numbers and report the truth as they see it. Democratic politicians are cheerleaders in varying degree\u2014there\u2019s Debbie Wasserman Schultz on the rah-rah end, but most Democrats don\u2019t brag too much for the same reason the White House doesn\u2019t.\n\nAnd the media voices on the left\u2014the folks on MSNBC, say\u2014try to accentuate the positive in political terms, but they don\u2019t ignore the bad news by any stretch of the imagination. MSNBC talks a lot about obstreperous Republicans, a theme to which I certainly contribute on air, but the network also offers a consistent diet of news features on and interviews with people stuck in the dead-end economy and having a hard time of it, segments that usually demand the government do more.\n\nNow, imagine that a Republican president produced 45 straight months of job growth coming off the worst financial crisis since the Depression. Lord, we\u2019d never hear the end of it from Fox and Limbaugh and even from CNBC. They wouldn\u2019t care about the reality that a lot of the jobs are low wage. They\u2019d just trumpet the bottom-line numbers as evidence of their president\u2019s Churchillian greatness.\n\nThat\u2019s how they are, and nothing\u2019s going to change them. The important question now, as I said up top, is whether we\u2019re really turning the psychic corner. Corporations have been hoarding record profits, banks still aren\u2019t lending they way they should be, businesses have been skittish about large-scale hiring. It\u2019s a big game of economic chicken, and it certainly has a political element. Most of these corporate titans and bankers and business leaders are Republicans. I don\u2019t think most of them would intentionally hold the economy back because they don\u2019t like the president, but I do think they take their cues from elected Republicans more than from Obama. When the Republicans stand up and say repeatedly that the president\u2019s policies are failing, failing, failing, these private-sector titans hear them, and it influences what they do.\n\nIt may be that we\u2019re finally working our way through all that.

The usual speakers at the annual conference, attendees said, were child development experts and players in the camping industry.\n\nThe sole booth with any political reference was HollyRock Entertainment, where a giant Bill Clinton head sat on display. (The vendor assured The Daily Beast that the Hillary head was commissioned and would be ready when she hits the campaign trail.)\n\nBut in many ways it was the perfect conditions for Clinton: a speech, softball Q&A with a political ally, and the press clustered off in the back of the room.\n\nHer campy (sorry) but self-deprecating humor (\u201cWhen I was growing up, back in the Middle Ages!\u201d) landed just right with a crowd accustomed to name games and trust falls.\n\nAnd even though many of the attendees weren\u2019t sure why Clinton was there, they were happy to have her.\n\nBut to be fair, the nearly 3,000 attendees seemed like a group of naturally upbeat and enthusiastic people.

She name-checked New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, an old political ally who hails from the left wing of her party, on the last point.\n\nBut the real fun began when she started talking about the political environment in Washington.

{"entityId": 1793, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Julian Castro is attractive and charismatic. He also has no business being a heartbeat away from the presidency.\n\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way early: Hillary Clinton\u2019s rumored No. 1 choice for vice president would be the least-qualified nominee for the job in decades.\n\nSure, it\u2019s a little early to play Hillary \u201cveepstakes,\u201d but when you don\u2019t really have a primary to worry about, you get speculation like this: During a Spanish-language interview with Univision\u2019s Al Punto the other day, Henry Cisneros, Bill Clinton\u2019s former HUD secretary, predicted current HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro would be Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate in 2016.\n\nCastro\u2019s \u201cthe first person on their list,\u201d Cisneros averred. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a second option,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause he is the superior candidate considering his record, personality, demeanor, and Latin heritage.\u201d This, of course, isn\u2019t a novel idea. Just months ago, my Daily Beast colleague Eleanor Clift speculated Castro is in \u201cVP Training Camp.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn many ways, picking Castro makes perfect sense. It would potentially excite Democrats who might be growing tired of the Clintons. It\u2019s not like Hillary has an obvious running mate (and it\u2019s hard to imagine that selecting, say, former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley would generate a ton of enthusiasm, or bring that much to the table). It would also balance the ticket in terms of age (Castro is just 40). And if it went well, it could also solve a long-term problem for the Democrats, which is that they don\u2019t have a bench of young rising stars with the experience to lead, and have fewer big-name statewide Hispanic candidates than Republicans do.\n\nThis was likely part of President Obama\u2019s calculus in offering Castro a chance to serve in his cabinet. It was unlikely that Castro could rise to the U.S. Senate or governor in deep-red Texas any time soon, and so there had to be a Plan B for giving him a resume that would be deemed minimally acceptable.\n\nThat Castro is Hispanic is no small detail. His addition to the ticket would a) make the 2016 Democratic ticket historic in two ways, and b) potentially blunt the possibility that Marco Rubio might be the GOP nominee, which would give Republicans the chance to also make history.\n\n\n\nSo picking Castro makes a great deal of political sense. Democrats are eager to nail down the rapidly-growing Hispanic voting constituency, and this\u2014coupled with Hillary\u2019s recent decision to go \u201call in\u201d on immigration reform\u2014could pose a serious threat to Republicans who might eventually find it mathematically impossible to win the White House. Yes, Castro (unlike Rubio or Jeb Bush) might not speak Spanish fluently. But, unlike any of the GOP\u2019s presidential hopefuls, he\u2019s Mexican-American, which matters for a variety of reasons, not least of which is that that\u2019s easily the largest Latino group in the U.S.\n\nNow, based on everything above, you might think this is a slam-dunk, right? Wrong. This is still a high-risk move.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s begin with the fact that Castro\u2019s most important elected experience was as San Antonio\u2019s mayor, which is a largely symbolic position. \u201cSan Antonio\u2019s city government is a council-manager system,\u201d explains the Atlantic\u2019s City Lab : \u201cUnlike the strong-mayor governments of Chicago or New York, San Antonio\u2019s government is led by a city manager, which is appointed by the City Council. The city charter invests in the city manager the authority to execute the laws and administer the government of the city.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Geraldine Ferraro, Senator Dan Quayle, and Governor Sarah Palin all got heat for their lack of experience, but at least they had all been elected to real jobs with actual responsibilities.\n\nElected in 2009, Castro was basically a glorified ribbon-cutter. He had \u201cno executive authority,\u201d as the Washington Examiner\u2019s Byron York noted last year when Castro was tapped for the HUD job. As mayor, he made around $4,000 a year, while the city manager made $355,000 to actually run the city. To make ends meet, Castro gave paid speeches and wrote a memoir, which together got him roughly $200,000 in 2013. Before that, he made a small fortune as a lawyer in a career that attracted a fair amount of scrutiny.\n\nBy the time November 2016 rolls around, Castro will have run HUD\u2014one of our less-efficient federal bureaucracies\u2014for a couple years and change. The last guy to try to use that office as a launching pad, for what it\u2019s worth, was Andrew Cuomo, who ran for New York governor in 2002 after leaving the agency and got clobbered in the Democratic primary.\n\nSo the experience of the supposed front-runner for the Democratic nomination boils down to five years in a ceremonial position and a couple years at HUD. Is this a worthy qualification of someone to be a heartbeat away from the presidency? Seriously, isn\u2019t the city manager actually more qualified to be vice president? And lastly, isn\u2019t the selection of a potential vice president especially important when the top of the ticket is of a certain age? I seem to remember that being bandied about when McCain was running.\n\nWhat we have here is a transparent attempt to pick someone inexperienced for political\u2014not governing\u2014 reasons. What we have here is an obvious attempt to pick someone young and attractive and charismatic to cover up the fact that the top of the ticket is none of those things. What we have here is an attempt to play identity politics by picking someone in the hopes that their identity will woo potential voters.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before, and it hasn\u2019t worked out well. Representative Geraldine Ferraro, Senator Dan Quayle, and Governor Sarah Palin all got heat for their lack of experience, but at least they had all been elected to real jobs with actual responsibilities.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro has everything you need to be the perfect running mate\u2014except, of course, the experience and resume to actually lead the country should, God forbid, something happen to the president. If Hillary selects him as her running mate, it will be an indication that she\u2019s willing to be reckless with the country\u2019s future in order to win. Clinton-Castro is a real possibility, but it should be noted that this one is high-risk for the country, even if it\u2019s high-reward for the Democrats.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:28.703+0000"}

He\u2019s known for being pugilistic on the Senate floor, but sometimes he\u2019d rather be fighting cartoon zombies on his iPhone.\n\nIt\u2019s an uncommon lens through which to view Cruz, a controversial conservative figure who is now running for the highest political office in the country. Cruz\u2019s video game habit fits into a largely hidden geek persona that lurks just behind his better-known public reputation as an obstinate Tea Party firebrand.\n\nAt the moment, Cruz is playing \u201cPlants vs. Zombies,\u201d a game where users collect sunlight points to feed plants who fight off waves of zombies; \u201cCandy Crush,\u201d the puzzle game where he claims he\u2019s in the 217th level; and \u201cThe Creeps!,\u201d a tower defense game.\n\nHis video game addiction is so severe, Cruz says, he has to proactively deny himself the ability to spend time on it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a console, mostly as a time management tool, because if I had one, I would use it far too much,\u201d he told The Daily Beast.\n\nThe Texas Republican explains the origins of his love for video games as a generational phenomenon. He ticks off his favorite games at his childhood arcade: \u201cGalaga,\u201d \u201cSpace Invaders,\u201d \u201cCentipede.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a kid growing up in the \u201970s and \u201980s. I had a Nintendo, an Atari,\u201d he said. \u201cI still remember the Christmas we got our first \u2018Pong\u2019 game.\u201d\n\nHis love for video games evolved over time as he entered college, then law school. David Panton, who was Cruz\u2019s roommate for 4\u00bd years through Princeton and later Harvard Law, recalls all-nighters spent on \u201cSuper Mario Brothers\u201d and Japanese fighting games.\n\nPutting aside debate and school government, Panton said, \u201cour favorite activity\u2026was video games.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would spend many hours playing video games, often until the sun came up. In reality, Ted was a much better player than I was\u2014he beat me in everything\u2014but I think I was sufficiently competitive that he felt somewhat challenged,\u201d Panton told The Daily Beast. \u201cI\u2019m a far better video game player today as a result of Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nVideo games have only once entered into Cruz\u2019s comments about government and public policy: in December, when he publicly mused about the overuse of drones in warfare.\n\n\u201cThere are also concerns from the perspective of national security. No administration has used drones as aggressively as has the Obama administration. And I\u2019m worried about what I would call video-game warfare,\u201d Cruz said at a Foreign Policy Initiative forum in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a console, mostly as a time management tool, because if I had one, I would use it far too much.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s where video games help: Cruz suffers from a perception of rigidity. When asked a question, his responses are always airtight and measured, the mark of a former debate champion. Often these conversations seem stilted and rehearsed. Unlike a more gregarious politician like Senator John McCain, Cruz doesn\u2019t make unscripted jokes or pal around much.\n\nIf asked a question Wednesday that he was previously asked on Monday, he will repeat his original answer nearly word for word, as if it were memorized, raising the risk of questions about how genuine he really is.\n\nHis passion for video games, and the way he uses them to connect with his children, cuts through some of that.\n\n\u201cI play with my daughters,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cOne of the fun things that I do with Caroline and Catherine is we get on the iPhone or the iPad and play games. Drives my wife crazy. She doesn\u2019t like it, but both girls like to curl up and play games. In our household, I\u2019m the one in charge of taking the girls to Chuck E.

So Cruz\u2019s love for video games is an admission that presidential candidates have only really been able to make in the past few years.\n\nBut there is one time a video game was used against Cruz.

In the beginning of 2014, ISIS fighters had defeated Iraqi forces in Fallujah, leading much of the U.S. intelligence community to assess they would try to take more of Iraq.\n\nBut in an interview that aired Sunday evening, the president told 60 Minutes that the rise of the group now proclaiming itself a caliphate in territory between Syria and Iraq caught the U.S. intelligence community off guard.

(He also said his analysts warned about the \u201cprowess and capability\u201d of the group.)\n\nStill, other senior intelligence officials have been warning about ISIS for months. In prepared testimony before the annual House and Senate intelligence committees\u2019 threat hearings in January and February, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the recently departed director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said the group would likely make a grab for land before the end of the year. ISIS \u201cprobably will attempt to take territory in Iraq and Syria to exhibit its strength in 2014.\u201d Of course, the prediction wasn\u2019t exactly hard to make. By then, Flynn noted, ISIS had taken the cities of Ramadi and Fallujah, and the demonstrated an \u201cability to concurrently maintain multiple safe havens in Syria.\u201d\n\nThe ability of ISIS to hold that territory will depend on its \u201cresources, local support, as well as the responses of [Iraqi security forces] and other opposition groups in Syria,\u201d Flynn added. He noted that while many Sunnis likely opposed ISIS, \u201csome Sunni tribes and insurgent groups appear willing to work tactically with [ISIS] as they share common anti-government goals.\u201d\n\nFlynn was not alone. Clapper himself in that hearing warned that the three most effective jihadist groups in Syria\u2014one of which he said was ISIS\u2014presented a threat as a magnet for attracting foreign fighters. John Brennan, Obama\u2019s CIA director, said he thought both ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra, al Qaeda\u2019s formal franchise in Syria, presented a threat to launch external operations against the West.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said February 4 that because of areas of Syria that are \u201cbeyond the regime\u2019s control or that of the moderate opposition,\u201d a \u201cmajor concern\u201d was \u201cthe establishment of a safe haven, and the real prospect that Syria could become a launching point or way station for terrorists seeking to attack the United States or other nations.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:29.163+0000"}

Here\u2019s why that plan doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nAfter a dozen years of serving as Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott prides himself on knowing the law.\n\nBut now that the governor-elect of the Lone Star State is threatening to sue President Obama over his executive action to temporarily shield from deportation some categories of illegal immigrants, it\u2019s obvious that the Republican is failing other subjects.\n\nAbbott, who claims Obama\u2019s immigration policy will disproportionally harm Texas, is foggy on the Constitution, executive power, immigration, geography, public policy, and current events. He could also use more common sense and a course in manners, since he\u2019s quick with insults and often demonstrates a knack for saying the wrong thing.\n\nAnd for someone who made an overt effort to reach out to Latino voters during his campaign\u2014speaking Spanish and strategically deploying his Mexican-American wife, Cecilia, who grew up in San Antonio and whose grandparents were Mexican immigrants\u2014Abbott could also use a deeper understanding of the community he\u2019s trying to seduce. With his threat of a lawsuit, he\u2019s attempting an awkward Mexican hat dance where he goes from courting Latinos in Texas to going to court to prevent more of them from entering Texas.\n\nTell me, Mr. Governor-elect, what\u2019s Spanish for \u201cthe honeymoon is over?\u201d\n\nIt is crucial for Republicans to reach out to groups that typically don\u2019t vote for the GOP, but substance is what matters. All the chips and salsa mixers in the world won\u2019t help an elected official who tries to make political hay out of policies that are supported by a majority of Latinos.\n\nA new survey by the polling firm Latino Decisions finds that Obama\u2019s decision to unilaterally re-prioritize deportations so that, for instance, the undocumented parents of U.S.-born citizens can\u2019t be removed for three years, is supported by 89 percent of Latinos.\n\nAy caramba! Even as a Mexican American, my Spanish is probably not as good as Abbott\u2019s. Tell me, Mr. Governor-elect, what\u2019s Spanish for \u201cthe honeymoon is over?\u201d\n\nAbbott\u2019s strategy is simple and cynical: Regardless of how Latinos feel about Obama\u2019s use of executive action, it is not very popular with the rest of America. A new CNN/ORC poll found that\u2014while most Americans agreed with the goal of keeping these families together\u201456 percent disagreed with the idea of the president acting unilaterally to accomplish it.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear which group Abbott, who may harbor presidential ambitions for 2020, is trying to court now by threatening a lawsuit.\n\nAny legal challenge would be a crapshoot given that several law professors and other experts on the Constitution have said that Obama is acting within his authority. But that\u2019s not the point. Abbott isn\u2019t trying to win in a court of law. He is only trying to get a head start among those Republicans who are eager to get political mileage out of fighting back against Obama\u2019s executive action.\n\nCertainly, Abbott isn\u2019t the first opportunistic politician in America to cravenly latch on to the immigration issue to scare up votes. There\u2019s a long list of politicians who have done so over the last 20 years, and they come from both parties.\n\nBut where Abbott goes wrong is in trying to connect DAPA (Deferred Action for Parental Accountability), enacted through the recent executive action, with DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), the program for undocumented youth that Obama unveiled in 2012. And then, once that connection is established, Abbott wants to take another leap and argue that DACA is solely responsible for the recent surge of more than 60,000 refugees from Central America\u2014most of them women and children.\n\nSimply put: Abbott is arguing that DAPA is like DACA, and that DACA caused the surge\u2014which, he insists, put a heavy burden on Texas. Ergo, DAPA will cause another surge\u2014and that future surge will likewise prove burdensome to Texas.\n\nHere\u2019s what Abbott is missing: DAPA applies to parents with U.S.-born children. So the only people who could conceivably think they might take advantage of it are additional waves of parents with U.S.-born children.\n\nThose folks are hard to come by outside the United States. Besides, DACA didn\u2019t cause the surge from Central America. That\u2019s a popular misconception on the right, and it\u2019s one that was\u2014unfortunately for Abbott\u2014resoundingly debunked when it was first raised during the surge.\n\nFor one thing, none of those children who crossed into the country last summer are eligible for DACA, because anyone who enters the country after June 15, 2007, does not qualify for the program. Besides, if DACA were to blame for the influx, it would have happened two years earlier when the policy was enacted. The real enticement for the refugees was a longstanding but unspoken policy by the Border Patrol to treat accompanied minors differently than adults and not immediately return them to their home countries.\n\nAlso, consider the timeline. By all accounts, the Obama administration first became aware of an unexpected surge in minors from Central America coming across the border as early as 2011, and DACA didn\u2019t take effect until August 2012.\n\nHowever, Abbott is not about to let cold hard facts get in the way of a little politically motivated demagoguery. He has dismissed arguments that new rounds of immigrants wouldn\u2019t be eligible for either DACA or DAPA.\n\n\u201cUnderstand this,\u201d Abbott recently told Fox News. \u201cThe people coming from Central America are typically not legal scholars who look into the depths of what the president is saying.\u201d\n\nOh boy. Condescend much, Mr. Governor-elect?\n\nLooking back, it\u2019s beyond dispute that the real impetus for the Central American refugee crisis wasn\u2019t something that Obama did but a piece of legislation signed into law by his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush. The 2008 William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act required that unaccompanied minors from countries other than Mexico and Canada not be immediately deported but placed with family members in the U.S. while awaiting a court date.\n\nSo, if anything, Abbott shouldn\u2019t be suing Obama. He should be suing Bush.\n\nFinally, Abbott seems to have forgotten what state he\u2019s in. It\u2019s silly for him to try to justify his legal challenge to Obama\u2019s executive action by exploiting the anxiety of Texans over the anticipated arrival of immigrants in the future while ignoring the present reality.\n\nTake it from someone who lived there for five years while writing for the Dallas Morning News: Texans don\u2019t need to worry about new arrivals of immigrants, since they already have plenty of immigrants living among them. And while many Texans are too proud to admit it, those people are there because they\u2019re doing jobs that Texans won\u2019t do.\n\nAfter he is sworn in as governor, Abbott should try to change that and challenge his fellow Texans to develop more of a work ethic. Then he could actually start making things better, instead of just making mischief.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:29.308+0000"}

Well, yes.\n\nWho knew that the police actions in a suburb of St. Louis of 15,000 people would suddenly reveal many of the deep fissures that have bedeviled America for a long time?\n\nFront and center, of course, is the issue of race, a constant in America since it decided to break away from the British Empire and to stand on its own 238 years ago. There is the tension over the militarization of local police, which has performed the amazing hat trick of uniting liberals, conservatives, and libertarians behind the notion that America has lost its damn mind. And finally, there is the trampling of the First Amendment when cops find that it is judicious and no one will care as long as the folks they are attacking are seen as worthless lawbreakers.\n\nIt\u2019s cute to think of the United States as a nation that has its stuff together and doesn\u2019t have to contend with the kind of fighting in Israel and the Gaza Strip or the battles being waged in Iraq. No, Americans aren\u2019t setting up IEDs and car bombs, or kidnapping hundreds of girls. But we are a nation at war with itself, and it plays out again and again when a Ferguson or a Bundy Ranch becomes a staple on cable news.\n\nRace. Enough with that post-racial crap. That was a media-driven line that never was real and was stupid in the first place. We have been long taught that the issue of race and slavery came to a boil when Abraham Lincoln was elected president, but Gerald Horne argues in The Counter-Revolution of 1776: Slave Resistance and the Origins of the United States of America, that the question of slavery was a driving force behind the Revolutionary War. Horne argues that with the abolition of slavery coming to fruition in England and among other British colonial holdings, the American colonies wanted to maintain the lucrative slave trade and thus chose to go to war in order to do so.\n\nEver since, America has grappled with its race problem, so it\u2019s not shock that Ferguson, Mo., a once all-white enclave, would all of a sudden be still dealing with race now that the city is two-thirds Black.\n\nYes, Michael Brown was an 18-year-old black teenager shot and killed by a white Ferguson police officer. But the animosity between the community and law enforcement is nothing new.\n\nThe family of Eric Garner is still trying to ascertain why a NYPD police officer used a banned chokehold to take him down, leading to his death.\n\nIn Los Angeles this week, Ezell Ford was gunned down, and he, like Brown, was unarmed.\n\nThis feeling of anger and dissension between the police and African Americans is nothing new, and it\u2019s not going to get better any time soon.\n\nEven Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who has made outreach to African Americans a cornerstone of his efforts the last several months, sees the connection.\n\n\u201cAnyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention,\u201d Paul wrote in an essay for Time: \u201cOur prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.\u201d\n\nInstead of the police mantra to \u201cprotect and serve,\u201d it has evolved into something akin to \u201ctake down and destroy.\u201d\n\nBut there are always silver linings. When Missouri\u2019s Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon got lots of pressure to do something about the menacing Ferguson police, he replaced them with Missouri State Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson. He brought a deft touch in handling a powder keg, and overnight, reduced the boiling temperatures that was close to putting Ferguson on the path to a fiery explosion.\n\nJohnson, who grew up in the area, is African American. He knows what the protesters were thinking and feeling. But maybe if Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson didn\u2019t have 50 out of 53 of his police officers being white, relations there might be a helluva lot better.\n\nCops playing soldiers. Watching the Ferguson police with their armored vehicles and dressed like they were about to take down Al-Qaeda in Kabul shocked many people. But for a good portion of the nation, it was not stunning to see what has been described as the militarization of our police forces.\n\nThe Department of Defense has used the nation\u2019s surplus military equipment to outfit local agencies with the latest military hardware. So instead of the police mantra to \u201cprotect and serve,\u201d it has evolved into something akin to \u201ctake down and destroy.\u201d\n\nWhether it was the War on Drugs or the Patriot Act as the main culprit, the situation has gotten out of hand. When the media show the hyper actions of these wannabe soldiers, public perception changes. And with people from different ideologies realizing that something must be done, we might finally see Congress take substantive action.\n\nIt\u2019s First for a reason. When did Ferguson reach the tipping point that angered American officials so much they said new leadership was needed on the ground? The tear gassing of protesters assembled in the street and the arrest of journalists Wesley Lowery and Ryan Reilly.\n\nIf there is one precious commodity for America, it is our touting of the First Amendment. Yet what we have seen in other cities played itself out in Ferguson: when facing bad news, authorities stop folks from protesting and shut out the media.\n\nA crew from Al Jazeera-America said they were targeted with tear gas, and we saw police dismantling their cameras and lights. Other journalists reported being accosted by police.\n\nBottom line: The First Amendment is there for our protection, and it deserves to be utilized by all.\n\n\u201cThe law enforcement response to these demonstrations must seek to reduce tensions, not heighten them,\u201d Attorney General Eric Holder said in a written statement. \u201cThose who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times. And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.\u201d\n\nThe anger in Ferguson only proves to all of us that as a nation, we have a lot of work to do to overcome our mistrust, our anger, our resentment and our fears. Only by confronting them can we change. Otherwise, we might as well prepare for another Ferguson, then another, and then another.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:29.997+0000"}

Nor do they appear to have been big Romney supporters. I likewise don\u2019t know any Romney donors or former campaign leadership at all connected to this group.\u201d\n\nLaunched late last week, Ready for Romney appears to be, at best, political amateur hour.\n\nThe executive director is a 26-year-old named Jeffrey Goff who lives in Boston and has never worked on a campaign, let alone for the former Massachusetts governor.\n\nGoff told The Daily Beast he had previously worked at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, then acknowledged he had merely attended a seminar there. He said he worked for an IT security consultancy, but when pressed for the name of his firm, he said clients just make out a check to him personally.\n\n\u201cThis \u2018Ready for Romney\u2019 organization has no ties to anyone in the conservative community, and for that reason I urge the public to avoid giving donations or getting involved.\u201d\n\nThe goal of the organization, he said, is to \u201clay the groundwork for a Romney candidacy, get an email list going, and compile a list of donors that will be ready if he\u2019s ready to run. What we want to do is work with those folks to stay all on the same message.\u201d\n\nGoff is joined by Peter Giuta, Ready for Romney\u2019s director of outreach, who works for a New York State Assembly member.

We\u2019re going to do everything we can.\u201d\n\nSince Ready for Romney\u2019s launch a week ago, Goff said, it has raised more than $5,000. Money is raised on the super PAC\u2019s website through Piryx, an online fundraising tool whose major investors include Democratic mega-donor Tom Steyer and Obama campaign veteran Andrew Bleeker. (No Labels co-founder and Daily Beast columnist Mark McKinnon is also an investor.) The plan is eventually to spend money running ads in Iowa and New Hampshire emphasizing Romney\u2019s record.\n\nOn Sunday, Ready for Romney held what it characterized as a nationwide call for activists hoping to draft Romney into the 2016 presidential race.

Romney aides say they do not recognize that name.\n\nIt is not unheard of for consultants to get rich off super PACs that fundraise on behalf of candidates and then do little to support their campaigns\u2014something former Romney aides fear is happening with Ready for Romney.\n\nBut Goff called it \u201cinsulting\u201d to suggest that he might be running a super PAC for personal gain.

{"entityId": 1799, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Last week, Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook executive famous for Lean In, the book and female-empowerment marketing campaign, announced an expansion called #leanintogether. The new twist is that it pulls men into the movement, telling them how to help women get ahead in the workplace and at their homes, and it roped in spokesmanship help from the likes of Warren Buffett and LeBron James.\n\nAlmost immediately, think pieces over whether this was actually good for women\u2014or rather, all women\u2014followed. It\u2019s not a new fight. Arguments over Sandberg, especially within the left and in the world of feminism, go back to even before the book came out.\n\nIn part, this is because Sandberg is perceived to be writing about and working to address challenges faced by a small group of elite women, those who have piled up the fancy degrees, racked up experience in the corporate world, and arguably should be shattering the glass ceiling into a million little pieces but are not. \u201cThe fact that she has more effectively rallied corporate leaders of both genders around the campaign than she has rallied women of different socioeconomic classes is very telling about who the campaign is for,\u201d the journalist Sarah Leonard told The New Yorker\u2019s Vauhini Vara.\n\nMore controversial is that rather than address the structural barriers that prevent women from getting ahead in the workplace, Sandberg has decided to speak directly to women about the ways they internalize sexism and lower expectations for themselves in the workplace. Many see this individualized approach as wrong-headed. Elizabeth Stoker Bruenig, writing this week in The New Republic, took that one step further and argued that the way Sandberg conducts her campaigns risks hurting lower-wage women. \u201cSandberg\u2019s corporate feminism preaches individual female empowerment in the workplace (and now at home, too) rather than collective social action,\u201d she writes, \u201cand women who subscribe to that approach are more likely to funnel resources into advanced education and leadership training rather than into the machinery of politics and protest.\u201d\n\nOn the one hand, I don\u2019t disagree that there\u2019s a particular spirit to Sandberg\u2019s rallying cry that clashes with my own politics. I don\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t: Sandberg is a wealthy white woman who made her way through corporate America to help lead the social media behemoths that now rule us from their libertarian-leaning Silicon Valley perches, and that undoubtedly influenced her approach. She is not a social worker, a union organizer, or me, a journalist who writes about poverty and inequality.\n\nEven if Sandberg\u2019s advice isn\u2019t useful to women other than those in her milieu, I\u2019m not sure why that should be harmful to others.\n\nLet\u2019s stipulate that Sandberg\u2019s book probably doesn\u2019t do a whole lot for the very poor, for women who work in fields (literally and figuratively) where bosses steal their wages illegally and openly prevent them from advancing. I would disagree, though, that it\u2019s only for women in the top rungs, or that it doesn\u2019t inspire a sense of in-it-togetherness. One of the tools Sandberg\u2019s campaign launched was Lean In circles\u2014I was invited to join one by a friend, though I never really participated. People I know, and people who\u2019ve spoken about them, include not just elites but decidedly middle-class professionals. Many took from these sessions a sense that they were not alone with their struggles at work, and felt a kind of relief to learn they weren\u2019t imaging a subtle sexism coming from their bosses at work.\n\nWhich hints at, I think, Sandberg\u2019s biggest contribution to the world: She gave women permission to talk about their work, to take pride in it, and to admit they wanted to be successful. In most of American society women are still required to view their roles as mothers first, and the work they do in the home as paramount. \u201cThe idea that ambition shouldn\u2019t be hampered by gender is so commonplace as to need little defense,\u201d says Stoker Bruenig. \u201cThe same goes for the call for dads to be involved at home.\u201d But I think those ideas are more controversial in many pockets of the country than Stoker Bruenig would assume. Subtle grooming of women to lower their academic and professional expectations so that they\u2019re not let down or pulled away from home or family, the disdain with which men openly disregard the work women do at home\u2014those beliefs are more prevalent than many would like to believe in 2015.\n\nSandberg is rich and privileged, and was lucky enough to be able to hire nannies and other domestic help. That is undoubtedly help that most American women do not have. But what has been our stereotype of women like Sandberg? In the common understanding, corporate women who do become successful in the career world and hire people to help raise their children are bad moms, the mean mommy with a briefcase stereotype, or worse, cold-fish types, emotionally barren and child-hating, a la the 1987 film Baby Boom. Sandberg wrote unapologetically about her own climb and her own success, humanizing the image of a corporate woman, and announced that she is both a good mother who works a lot and has a nanny. That\u2019s helpful in chipping away at the stereotype.\n\nEven if Sandberg\u2019s advice isn\u2019t useful to women other than those in her milieu, I\u2019m not sure why that should be harmful to others. Some fear that if Sandberg encourages women to negotiate for things like paid maternity leave for themselves, it will take the air out of movements for universal reforms led by the government. That shouldn\u2019t necessarily be true. Most college graduates and powerful people negotiate pay and benefits packages that are higher than the minimum wage, but that hasn\u2019t dampened support for a minimum wage hike or universal paid-sick leave package. In fact, those reforms remain very popular.\n\nLaws ensuring that all workers have such basic benefits are already sweeping the nation, and we haven\u2019t arrived squarely in the 2016 campaign yet. Who knows where the women influenced by Sandberg will throw their political weight? There\u2019s no reason to think they wouldn\u2019t support candidates who will address the concerns they\u2019ve been talking about in their Lean In circles. Indeed, the voices of female politicians addressing the needs of women have only gotten louder since Lean In came out.\n\nLet\u2019s say Sandberg\u2019s sole goal is to raise the number of female CEO\u2019s and achieve parity in boardrooms, and that she only wants to make the world better for those women. Why should we care? It\u2019s not as though women in business are floating along on clouds of privilege with an easy life free of discrimination. Their privilege is relative, and just because other women have it worse than they do doesn\u2019t erase the challenges they face. At worst, it makes Sandberg a very visible and imperfect vehicle for the mantle of feminism, but surely it is better to have as many of those as possible rather than too few.\n\nWhy do people find Sandberg\u2019s advice so offensive? I think it\u2019s because she\u2019s speaking for herself, and encouraging other women to do the same. Women never speak solely on their own behalf. It violates an unspoken requirement that the first words we say must be, \u201cOh no, you go ahead,\u201d and that women must help others first.\n\nIt is possible to fight a battle on many fronts.

He refused to answer the question because it wasn\u2019t sufficiently of the softball variety he and his press handlers had expected of their audience. You know, the kind whereby he\u2019d be asked to expand on his prior observation that \u201cthe world has so many problems and so many failures, and you come here and it\u2019s so beautiful.

Maybe Dennis is a lot better than what we have,\u201d Trump said of the athlete who praised the dictator of the world\u2019s only remaining Stalinist slave state as a \u201cgood-hearted kid.\u201d Granted, this was before Kim had his defense minister killed with anti-aircraft guns for nodding off during a compulsory military parade\u2014and possibly because he ran out of his other favored instruments of execution, mortars and flamethrowers.\n\nRodman came back from one of his trips to Pyongyang and declared that what Kim wants most of all is for Obama to pick up the phone and rap at him. Trump thinks this sounds like a plan. \u201cMaybe that is not the worst thing, folks, instead of going through this whole charade we do every year,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not the worst thing that somebody actually calls, because this world is just blowing up around us. We are doing nothing. It\u2019s not a very big deal to make a phone call.\u201d Flamethrowers, dude.\n\nEgypt. Now here The Donald has shown himself to be very presidential with a little strategic flip-floppery. When Tahrir Square kicked off in early 2011, he was glad to see the back of Hosni Mubarak, telling a group of reporters, when the Egyptian strongman delegated responsibility to his vice president: \u201cSo far, things are looking all right. [Mubarak] lives in tremendous estates all over the world. Supposedly, he\u2019s taken $50 to $70 billion. Is this the kind of a leader they want? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nNearly a year later, however, Trump thought so very much, since by then he was harping on doom-and-gloom for the most populous Arab state. In November 2011, he tweeted: \u201cEgypt is turning into a hot bed of radical Islam. The current protest is another coup attempt. We should never have abandoned Mubarak.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s one influential billionaire Egyptian who\u2019d likely agree with Trump\u2019s latter assessment and who has already endorsed him for president: Naguib Sawiris, the second-richest man in Egypt, tweeted yesterday, \u201cI think i ll support Donald Trump for next US presidency elections,a successful entrepreneur did well for himself will do well for America !\u201d\n\nSawiris, the Coptic founder and chairman of telecom giant Orascom TMT Holding, was a prominent backer of Tamarrod, the ostensibly youth-led protest movement against the Muslim Brotherhood-led government of former Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi. He was a principal, albeit quiet, financier and organizer of the \u201crebellion,\u201d which culminated in a military coup two years ago by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, now the current president. Sawiris lent all the ample resources at his disposal, and that of his political party the Free Egyptians, to help topple Morsi, including a television network and Egypt\u2019s largest privately owned newspaper. \u201cTamarrod did not even know it was me!\u201d he gushed to The New York Times in July 2013. \u201cI am not ashamed of it.\u201d Silent investors make the world go round; they also guard you while you sleep.

The invitation to this sold-out event identifies Trump as the \u201cvery definition of American success.\u201d Due to Trump\u2019s recent controversy-courting comments regarding undocumented immigrants, interest in the Trump dinner shot through the roof.\n\nBut what, exactly, is Friends of Abe?\n\nFOA is a secretive group of Hollywood right-wingers (the \u201cone and only fellowship for entertainment industry conservatives\u201d) that formed in early 2005. It has been described as a \u201cstealth right-wing group,\u201d \u201cinfluential in conservative circles,\u201d a \u201cGOP support group,\u201d and as operating under \u201cthe same PR rules as Fight Club.\u201d\n\nThe full list of FOA members is kept under lock-and-key (to avoid potential blacklisting in a decidedly left-wing Tinseltown), and the group only recently achieved nonprofit status from the IRS after a three-year fight to do so.\n\nFounding and high-profile \u201cfriends\u201d include Gary Sinise, Kelsey Grammer, Patricia Heaton, Clint Eastwood, Jon Voight, and Oscar-nominated screenwriter Lionel Chetwynd. The hundreds of right-leaning members are invited to attend strictly off-the-record functions where Hollywood players get the chance to meet political celebrities, and also to network with like-minded entertainment-industry types. Past events have included a speech by Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, summer fiestas, a pie-baking contest and family picnic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a growing movement, and word is getting out that there\u2019s many of us in this business,\u201d singer Pat Boone, an FOA associate, told The Washington Times in 2008. \u201cIf certain studio execs\u2014hirers and firers\u2014learn that this is a movement and growing, and that some of these people that they hire are of this inclination, these people could be unemployed.\u201d\n\nTrump is just the latest in a long line of Republican candidates and VIPs to speak before Friends of Abe. The group has recently hosted and toasted fellow 2016 contenders Rand Paul, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Mike Huckabee, and previously welcomed heavyweights such as Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Paul Ryan, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, John Boehner, Dick Cheney, Rush Limbaugh, and Ann Coulter. FOA gatherings have become opportunities for candidates to explore potential support and future fundraising opportunities, much in the same way President Obama and so many other Democratic politicians fly into Hollywood to meet and charm their famous fans, prospective donors, and potential bundlers and celebrity campaign-season allies.\n\n\u201cFriends of Abe has absolutely no political agenda,\u201d Jeremy Boreing, the organization\u2019s executive director (who also serves as managing editor at right-wing media watchdog TruthRevolt), told The New York Times last year. \u201cIt exists to create fellowship among like-minded individuals.\u201d (Boreing did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment.)\n\nDue to the hyper-secretive nature of this Hollywood-elite fellowship, the renewed attention to the organization might not be the most comfortable thing for its more discretion-minded members.

{"entityId": 1802, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "It\u2019s not just the Democrats who are opposed to a new select committee looking into the Benghazi attacks. Many top Republicans are uneasy, too.\n\nLast Wednesday, as the House was preparing for its new investigation into the Benghazi attacks, House intelligence committee chairman Mike Rogers gathered Republican members of his committee for a meeting. While the main purpose of the meeting was to discuss surveillance reforms the committee was about to pass, Rogers also warned his colleagues about the upcoming select committee to investigate Benghazi.\n\n\u201cHe was saying this could be a rabbit hole,\u201d one House member told The Daily Beast. \u201cHe was warning us that we should not let this investigation get into conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nContrary to the caricature of Republicans, as singularly obsessed for political reasons with Benghazi, the reality is quite different. There is deep unease within the Republican leadership that the select committee, which has yet to announce a schedule of hearings, could backfire, and badly. Investigate and find nothing new, and the committee looks like a bunch of tin-hatted obsessives. Investigate and uncover previously-hidden secrets, and it makes all of the other Republican led panels that dug into Benghazi seem like Keystone Kops.\n\nThree Republican sources tell The Daily Beast that the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Armed Services, and Government Reform committees\u2014Reps. Rogers, Buck McKeon, and Darrell Issa, respectively\u2014all opposed the formation of a select committee on Benghazi. All three men have led their own investigations into the matter.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner himself resisted calls to form the committee for nearly a year and a half. Rep. Frank Wolf, a Republican from Virginia, proposed a special select committee on Benghazi first in November 2012. Since then he worked to get a majority of Republicans to sign onto his plan.\n\nBut it was not until Judicial Watch in April uncovered a set of White House emails on Benghazi\u2014emails that were not shared with Congress\u2014that Boehner agreed to Wolf\u2019s idea.\n\nBoehner\u2019s calculation was, in part, political, according to one House Republican aide. The Speaker was looking to mollify the Tea Party faction of his caucus who were upset with him about a range of issues, including the federal budget and immigration reform.\n\n\u201cThere is a whole combination of factors here,\u201d this aide said. \u201cYou have the email. But remember Boehner has also gotten a lot of resistance from House Republicans on immigration. He wanted to turn the page on this.\u201d This aide said that Boehner\u2019s view was that, \u201cOK, I am giving you guys this committee, now it\u2019s on you to make this work.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was saying this could be a rabbit hole. He was warning us that we should not let this investigation get into conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, for her part, has said she is considering a Democratic boycott of the committee, but has yet to decide.\n\nSince the investigations into Benghazi began in earnest in 2012, the GOP has been divided on what these probes would ultimately uncover. While some claim there was a massive White House operation to cover up the attacks, Rogers and McKeon see a more nuanced story. Rogers has been highly critical of the administration\u2019s failure to call the assault a terrorist attack; but he has not accused the administration of in any way abandoning the CIA officers protecting the agency\u2019s base that evening. McKeon\u2019s oversight work has focused on the failure of the administration to have key military assets in place for the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks when there was ample reason to believe al Qaeda would seek out soft targets to strike on that day.\n\nWhen Rogers\u2019s committee finally heard in a closed session last year from the CIA contractors who responded on the evening of the attacks, Rogers downplayed their testimony in interviews. On Fox News he said he did not believe the CIA was stonewalling his committee, as others had alleged.\n\nOther lawmakers, however, such as Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the Utah Republican who first contacted key State Department whistleblower Greg Hicks, say the Benghazi story is more about how the White House failed to deploy all of its assets on the evening of the attack to save Americans.\n\nChaffetz, who serves on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform but was not chosen for the select committee, came close to uncovering evidence for his view this month when retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert Lovell testified that the military did not even try to save personnel on the night of the Benghazi attacks, or in his words, \u201crun to the sound of the guns.\u201d\n\nAfter Lovell\u2019s testimony, McKeon issued a statement defending his own investigation\u2019s conclusion that no assets were in place to conduct such an operation. \u201cLovell did not serve in a capacity that gave him reliable insight into operational options available to commanders during the attack, nor did he offer specific courses of action not taken,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nThis tension between committees has often played out inside the Republican conference, behind closed doors. And the new, select committee may only make things worse.\n\n\u201cLook at this from their perspective,\u201d one House Republican told The Daily Beast. \u201cThis [select] committee in many ways will be checking their work. No one likes that.\u201d Rep. Tim Huelskamp, a Republican from Kansas, told Slate\u2019s Dave Weigel last week: \u201cMike Rogers fought against this for a year and a half. They used to stand up in conference and say, \u2018Quit worrying about it, we\u2019ve got it all taken care of.\u2019\u201d\n\nBoehner selected Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former career prosecutor, to lead the Benghazi committee. To date, Gowdy has played his cards close to the vest as to what the committee will actually investigate. Last week, at a press conference, Rep. Jim Jordan, who is also serving on the new select committee on Benghazi, said the panel will focus on the \u201cbefore,\u201d \u201cduring\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d of the attack. He later explained that this meant probes into why the State Department denied requests for security to the Benghazi diplomatic post and why the early talking points on Benghazi downplayed the possibility that it was a terrorist attack. But Jordan also said the committee would investigate, to borrow Lovell\u2019s phrase, why U.S. forces weren\u2019t \u201crunning to the sound of the guns.\u201d\n\nIf the Benghazi committee uncovers new evidence that the Obama administration failed to do all it could to save Americans on the evening of the attack, it would be a vindication for their party and a scandal for the White House. But it may also end up revealing prior investigations from Congressional Republicans to be hollow.\n\nIf this committee, however, does not find that smoking gun, then it will also prove the low-key warnings of lawmakers like Rogers and McKeon to have been correct all along. No wonder top Republicans were so reluctant to have it move forward.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:32.971+0000"}

And the other team includes Barack Obama and John Boehner. So how did such strange alliances get formed?\n\nThe \u201ccromnibus\u201d, the budget bill that would avoid a shutdown and keep the government open until next October, has become bogged in controversy as conservative Republicans and many Democrats have joined together in opposition. But, unsurprisingly, they have very different issues with the bill.\n\nDemocrats are up in arms about several policy riders attached to the cromnibus. In particular, a provision that would amend the Dodd-Frank financial reform act by weakening on restrictions on big banks trading derivatives. The result has led influential Democrats like Elizabeth Warren to go to the barricades in opposition to the bill and helped push Pelosi and other members of the House Democratic caucus to try and sink the legislation, which was developed in bipartisan negotiations between House Republicans and Senate Democrats.\n\nAnd attempt to roll back Dodd-Frank isn\u2019t the only provision that has upset Pelosi. The House Minority Leader also expressed her displeasure with a provision in the bill that would allow donors to give up to $1.5 million to political party committees in an election cycle. But the real animus seems directed towards the language changing Dodd-Frank.\n\nIn contrast, Republicans are worked up on immigration, particularly the President\u2019s executive order on immigration from earlier this year that would allow up to five million undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States indefinitely. A number of Republicans are refusing to support any legislation that would fund this executive order, which they claim is an unconstitutional amnesty.\n\nTwo of the most conservative Republicans in the House, Michele Bachmann and Steve King, told reporters that they have a clean 60-day continuing resolution to keep the government open, only with an amendment which would prohibit any funding for the President\u2019s executive order. They then would expect the Senate to strip that amendment and compromise simply on keeping government open for 60 days.\n\nIn their opinion, this would allow conservatives to lay a marker down on immigration while avoiding a shutdown for the time being. Instead, it would set the stage for a massive showdown in February, when Republicans would control both the House and the Senate. Then, conservatives hope that they can finally defund the President\u2019s executive order on immigration.\n\nRegardless of how the showdown ends, it does serve a very clear signal of what the political climate will be in the next Congress.\n\nFor the meantime, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a clear path for the cromnibus as written to make it through the House to the Senate (where it is expected to pass.) The House Republican leadership could barely win a procedural vote earlier Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe problem for Republicans is that up to 70 members of their caucus will vote against the bill, and there are nowhere near enough Democrats willing to support the legislation\u2014-even though top administration officials like Joe Biden are lobbying for it. At this point, every option is on the table, and a congressional source told The Daily Beast that the GOP leadership is even contemplating a more conservative cromnibus in an attempt to win back wavering members while still avoiding a short-term deal.\n\nRegardless of how the showdown ends, it does serve a very clear signal of what the political climate will be in the next Congress. By bringing government to the brink of a shutdown over financial reform, progressives have shown their firepower on the issue\u2014just as Tea Partiers in the past have forced debate on immigration reform and Obamacare. The provisions weakening Dodd-Frank may still become law and the cromnibus may still pass. But progressives have made clear that the next time Democrats make concessions to GOP to forge compromise, it\u2019ll save a lot of frustration if the deal doesn\u2019t alter Dodd-Frank.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:33.146+0000"}
{"entityId": 1804, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "A new survey finds Millennials disillusioned by Obama and the Democrats. It\u2019s a GOP opportunity, if the party is smart enough to take it.\n\nWednesday\u2019s newly released Harvard University Institute of Politics survey of Americans under the age of 30 suggests that GOP just might be on the road to recovery, though they\u2019ve still got a long way to go.\n\nFor years, young voters in America have been unenthusiastic about, if not outright hostile toward, the GOP. The roots of the breakup between so-called \u201cMillennial\u201d voters\u2014those born after 1980\u2014and the Republican Party go back to the 2006 midterms. It was in that wave election, which elevated Nancy Pelosi to the role of Speaker of the House, that Republicans performed worse among young voters than either party had performed among any age group, going back to the 1980s. While the presidential election of 2008 and Obama\u2019s campaign of \u201cHope and Change\u201d are what most people associate with the rise of the Democratic young electorate, the seeds of the leftward shift had already been planted; Obama needed only to capitalize on the moment.\n\nThis midterm, while unlikely to be a Millennial-led blowout for the GOP, may hold the seeds for a Republican Party eager to re-capture a share of the youth vote in 2016 and beyond.\n\nFar from the enormous double-digit margins Democrats have held over their Republican adversaries in the youth vote, the Harvard poll shows only half of young people preferring a Congress controlled by Democrats, while 43 percent say they\u2019d prefer a Republican Congress. That\u2019s among young people overall, not just those who are registered to vote and who plan to turn out; among those who say they are likely to vote, Republicans actually hold an advantage with young people, with 51 percent saying they\u2019d like Republicans running the show. (The Harvard researchers note that this is even an improvement over how Republicans stood with young people in the 2010 GOP wave election; during that year, Republicans still trailed among these likely voters by 12 points.)\n\nYoung voters are ticked off and tuned out. Only 18 percent say they consider themselves politically engaged, and only 6 percent say they closely follow news about national politics. Only 15 percent think the country is on the right track. Majorities disapprove of the job President Obama is doing, as well as the job being done be Republicans and Democrats in Congress. Issue by issue, roughly six out of ten young people disapprove of the President\u2019s performance handling things like health care, the budget deficit, and immigration. When Democrats say young people support what they\u2019ve done with the last six years, young people disagree.\n\nYoung voters are ticked off and tuned out\u2026 Only 6 percent say they closely follow news about national politics.\n\nAnd while it is certainly true that the GOP is not loved by very many young people, it is an astonishing failure on the part of the Democrats that their performance on the ballot in the Harvard survey is so underwhelming, given that fewer than one out of four young people actually approve of the job Republicans are doing in Congress. That Republicans have pulled to nearly even with Democrats on questions like \u201cwhich party do you trust more to handle the economy\u201d is a remarkable turn of events from just four years ago. That 57 percent of young people still say they disapprove of the Affordable Care Act is devastating for Democrats who have relied on that law as the crux of their sales pitch to the Millennial generation.\n\nSure, this has been an election where young voters have not been front and center. Politicians and political parties see how the youth vote drops off significantly in midterm years and focus their efforts elsewhere. In 2010, young voters only made up 11 percent of the electorate. Disgust and frustration with both parties leaves young people feeling like there\u2019s no point to voting, and so a big surge in youth turnout is unlikely. Yet in contests that will be decided by razor-thin margins, even a few disillusioned young voters who came out for Obama in 2012 but are stay home next week will make all the difference.\n\nMore interesting will be what Republicans do with this opening. Remember, young voters have not warmed up to the GOP. They may no longer be the exclusive property of the Democratic Party, but they\u2019re not signing up en masse for the Republican Party either. Generational divides over issues like the same-sex marriage may not be not defining this election, but they certainly aren\u2019t going away, either.\n\nIf the GOP hopes to turn the tables and pick up ground in the 2016 election, they have to capitalize on the opening they\u2019ve been given by showing they can do more than stop the President. They\u2019ve got to explain what the Republican vision is for the future of America and why that\u2019s something worth voting for.

I fear it can\u2019t be fixed from within,\u201d he said, while attempting to make the case that he can lead the country to a better tomorrow. If Reagan was a happy warrior, Paul is a confused one.\n\n\u201cI have been to Washington, and let me tell you, there is no monopoly on knowledge there,\u201d he smirked.\n\nAccording to Paul\u2019s FEC filing, the anti-Washington campaign\u2019s official P.O.

It seemed more fitting for a school talent show or a sad business retreat than the launch of a presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cSome people asked me, \u2018Why are you running?\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cThe answer is the same now as it was then.

Did her handlers fear what for the gaffe-prone Republican might say?\n\nIn Iowa\u2019s Senate campaign, one candidate has been prone to making outrageous and controversial remarks that have garnered copious amounts of national press. The other one is the gaffe-prone candidate.\n\nRepublican Senate nominee Joni Ernst had managed to sail by despite a litany of comments that sound like they come from bedtime stories that Huffington Post readers use to scare their children. Ernst has endorsed nullification of federal laws, warned of the United Nations evicting Iowa farmers from their land, called President Obama \u201ca dictator,\u201d and claimed that the \u201ccap and trade law,\u201d which never passed, is the federal regulation most undermining job creation. These all got national attention and made national headlines. However, they had absolutely no effect on the Iowa electorate.\n\nIn contrast, Democratic nominee Bruce Braley has suffered huge, overwhelming political damage from a comment surreptitiously recorded at a January fundraiser where he expressed horror that if the GOP took control of the Senate that the Judiciary Committee would be led by Chuck Grassley, \u201ca farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law.\u201d The statement could be construed at poking fun of either farmers or Grassley, both of which enjoy near universal popularity in the Hawkeye State. The result put Braley on the defense and combined with a couple of other stories, like a dispute with a neighbor over stray chickens, turned Braley into shorthand for political dysfunction this cycle. As a result, a candidate once expected to cruise to victory has been consistently trailing by a small margin in recent polls.\n\nHowever, Ernst may have finally committed her own devastating gaffe this week. Her problem wasn\u2019t what she said but that she didn\u2019t say anything at all.\n\nErnst had long been scheduled to meet Thursday with the editorial board of The Des Moines Register, the biggest and most influential paper in Iowa. The meeting would have included the paper\u2019s publisher, its editor, editorial board as well as various columnists and reporters\u2014all of whom would have been able to ask questions of Ernst. It would all be recorded and live-streamed on the Internet as well. But then, Wednesday night, her campaign suddenly said the candidate would not be able to attend and that the meeting was canceled.\n\nThe result came as a shock. One source familiar with The Des Moines Register\u2019s editorial process told The Daily Beast that this type of cancellation was unprecedented. In doing so, Gretchen Hamel, a spokesperson for the Ernst campaign, said that the paper was biased. \u201cRecent editorials in The Des Moines Register make their position in this race perfectly clear, and it\u2019s one that many voters across our state seem to disagree with,\u201d said Hamel in a statement. Hamel added the campaign was still \u201ctrying to schedule\u201d meetings with other editorial boards as well.\n\nOutside observers though found it mystifying that Ernst shunned the Register\u2019s editorial board. While the Republican had been the subject of several negative editorials in recent weeks, knowledgeable Democratic operatives were convinced that she was still likely to get the Register\u2019s endorsement. Further, Iowa Democrats have often griped about the perception that Ernst gets far more favorable news coverage from the Register than Braley. So why would she skip a meeting?\n\nIt\u2019s totally off-message for Ernst. The Republican has run as the \u201cIowa nice candidate.\u201d\n\nThe best explanation is that her campaign was afraid that she would make another controversial statement. During her one meeting with an editorial board during the general election\u2014the Sioux City Journal\u2019s on Oct. 15\u2014Ernst came out in favor of a constitutional amendment to ban abortion. Further, when she met with the Register\u2019s editorial board before her primary (in which the panel eventually endorsed her), Ernst insisted that Iraq actually had weapons of mass destruction in 2003. But these statements, along with the host of other potential gaffes she\u2019s committed throughout the campaign, didn\u2019t hurt Ernst.\n\nThe problem with her canceling on the Register editorial board is that, unlike an offhand comment about impeachment, it\u2019s totally off-message for Ernst. The Republican has run as the \u201cIowa nice candidate.\u201d Even her most extreme remarks have been delivered with a smile as she radiates the warmth of a friendly small-town neighbor. Canceling on a commitment with short notice is not Iowa nice, particularly in a state that values its political traditions.\n\nErnst\u2019s cancellation made news across the state. Any controversial statement that she might have made in an editorial board meeting would have been on the front page of Talking Points Memo. Instead, she made the front page of the Quad-City Times.\n\nShe may have avoided saying something outrageous, but sometimes the gaffe isn\u2019t the controversial thing you say but the controversial thing you don\u2019t say.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:34.268+0000"}

If he\u2019s trying to push her left, his efforts are wasted, Clinton advisers say.\n\nDuring a Democratic primary season in which Hillary Clinton\u2019s putative opponents have pointedly declined to criticize her, Bill de Blasio has emerged as the voice of the liberal opposition, declining to endorse her on national television on the day she announced her candidacy, traveling to the early primary states to tout his vision for the Democratic Party, and on Tuesday unveiling a \u201cProgressive Contract With America\u201d alongside dozens of fellow travelers in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut if all that activity is supposed to rally the Democratic base to pull Clinton to the left, the Clinton campaign would like to thank de Blasio very much for his effort, but says it is unnecessary.\n\n\u201cFor her entire career, Hillary Clinton has championed many of the issues included in this contract,\u201d said Karen Finney, senior campaign spokeswoman. \u201cShe has a long record of pushing for progress on issues like family leave, income inequality, and education, and she looks forward to continuing the conversation around these important topics as she lays out her own ideas in this campaign.\u201d\n\nIndeed, many of the nearly a dozen Clinton advisers and supporters contacted for this article said they welcomed de Blasio\u2019s forays into presidential politics, as so much of what he has been trying to do is create a constituency that dovetailed with Clinton\u2019s own record and platform. Most of the issues de Blasio touts in his Progressive Agenda to Combat Income Inequality, like a higher minimum wage and higher taxes on the wealthy, have been pushed by President Obama, to little avail, and Clinton has spoken out in favor of them.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton has a long career of advocating for progressive issues\u2014the minimum wage, issues important to women,\u201d said Jack Rosen, a New York-based real estate executive and longtime donor to Bill and Hillary Clinton. \u201cDe Blasio has a right to speak out on issues he cares about, but Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t need any advice. She has her own inner compass on this.\u201d\n\nTom Sheridan, a top D.C lobbyist and a donor to the Clinton campaign, said that by trying to pressure Clinton from the left, de Blasio was actually creating space for Clinton to position herself as palatable to the broad middle.\n\n\u201cHe is giving her running room and new ways to position herself on these issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s all good, I really do. You have people trying to put pressure on the left wing and the right wing, and Hillary gets to show that she knows how to fly the plane, so to speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the purpose of this is to put pressure on our candidate, there are better ways to do it, and it\u2019s unnecessary anyway.\u201d\n\nPolls show that Clinton remains strongly popular with even the most liberal elements of the party, though grassroots organizers continue to push Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as a populist challenger to her. Robert Wolf, a former CEO of UBS Americas and friend of Obama who has already signed on to the Clinton campaign financial operation, predicted that the impact of de Blasio\u2019s press conference Tuesday on the Clinton campaign would be minimal, especially once Clinton flushes out more of her own agenda.\n\n\u201cTo me the candidates that are talking about real issues like the secretary last week on immigration versus trying to rally the far left or the far right seem to get the most traction to the thoughtful person, as opposed to getting the most media hype of the day,\u201d Wolf told The Daily Beast.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say Team Clinton isn\u2019t a bit mystified at what de Blasio is doing. The New York City mayor owes his career in part to Clinton, having served as campaign manager for her 2000 run for the U.S. Senate, then parlaying that experience into his first political run. Bill Clinton inaugurated de Blasio as mayor, while Hillary Clinton looked on. \u201cI am proud to come from the Clinton family,\u201d de Blasio told reporters after he won the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cIf he were running for president, that would be one thing, but he is not,\u201d said Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic strategist and longtime adviser to both Clintons. \u201cPeople who hold elective office like to get covered and like to be heard and like to be part of the conversation. I take him at face value.\u201d\n\nPeople in and close to the Clinton campaign say they take de Blasio at his word, that he is not running for president (despite a New York Post report to the contrary). Rather, they assume he is trying either to elevate his national profile and capitalize on a Democratic base yearning for a standard-bearer, or trying to shore up his credentials with progressives in New York in the face of sinking poll numbers and what could be a potentially competitive reelection in 2017.\n\n\u201cI know Bill de Blasio like the back of my hand,\u201d said Manhattan borough president Gale Brewer, who served with de Blasio in the David Dinkins administration in City Hall and in the City Council, and who was one of the first New York City elected officials to endorse the Ready for Hillary super PAC that laid the groundwork for another Clinton run.\n\n\u201cHe thinks this is part of his official duties as mayor,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, you elevate yourself when you do that, but in his head it is about elevating the city.\u201d\n\nBrewer said she was supportive of the mayor\u2019s efforts if it meant getting more resources to the city. If it also meant getting Clinton to tack left, well, good luck.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that is helpful,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cShe is going to do what she needs to do to win the election. I don\u2019t know too many people who are listening to what Bill de Blasio is saying about Hillary Clinton being to the left or not. They are judging Hillary Clinton on her own pluses and minuses.\u201d\n\nMuch of the Democratic establishment backed Clinton long before she was even a candidate, even many of those who appeared alongside de Blasio at his press conference in Washington on Tuesday. If de Blasio\u2019s non-endorsement on Meet the Press was a bit curious, few Clintonistas doubted that he would eventually come around.\n\n\u201cI was with Bill de Blasio in the 2000 Senate campaign. I bumped into him several times in Ohio in 2008 when he was campaigning for Hillary,\u201d said Ann Lewis, a longtime Clinton adviser. \u201cAnd I fully expect to be campaigning with him again.\u201d\n\nFormer Rep. Anthony Weiner, a one-time de Blasio opponent\u2014and whose wedding to a Hillary Clinton aide was officiated by Bill Clinton\u2014agreed. He said de Blasio had every right to step out on the national stage as mayor of New York but that he was not sure exactly what the point of it all would be.\n\n\u201cIt takes some hubris here to suggest that Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t understand the challenges of inequality or the challenges facing our country,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cSo what are you going to do, say, \u2018I am going to hold my breath until Hillary becomes a good Democrat?\u2019 If the purpose of this is to put pressure on our candidate, there are better ways to do it, and it\u2019s unnecessary anyway.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:34.776+0000"}

The common perspective was Leno was the anti-Letterman/Stewart/Colbert and the only host to make jokes at President Obama\u2019s expense on a nightly basis.

But Fallon and those advising him are far too savvy and smart for that line of thinking.

Say what you will about Mitt Romney\u2019s infamous 47 percent comment; it couldn\u2019t have been more accurate. No Presidential candidate will ever get more than 53 percent of the vote again. Battle lines have been drawn (partially thanks to cable news becoming more opinion than actual news) and the number of true independent voters is shrinking.\n\nThe proof of Fallon\u2019s strategy lies is in the guests he\u2019s booked on the program lately: Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Sarah Palin, Mitt Romney. And each wasn\u2019t there for the usual interview, but to actually perform in the variety/sketch aspect of the show that separates the host from his competitors.\n\nPalin\u2019s appearance last week was particularly surprising: Here we had Fallon in the role of an invasion-happy Vladimir Putin and Palin as a tough-talking \u201cgrizzly mama.\u201d When all was said and done, America\u2019s most polarizing female figure came across as likable, funny and talented (even playing the flute in a duet with \u201cPutin\u201d on the Ukulele). As for the script for the sketch, it miraculously walked the line of being hilarious without being offensive to anyone:\n\nPutin/Fallon in a bad Russian accent: \"I heard back in 2008, you predicted I would invade Ukraine. Is that true?\"\n\n\"You betcha, Vlad,\" replies Palin.\n\nShe then warns Russia to leave Ukraine alone, to which \u201cPutin\u201d replies, \"Whoa, hey Capt. Buzzkill!\"\n\nAnd later in the skit: \"You shoot bear? I prefer hand-to-hand combat,\" says \"Putin.\"\n\n\"Well, that's why everyone calls you such a strong leader,\" replies Palin.\n\n\"I come from strong genes. President Obama, he comes from mom jeans!\" he answers, borrowing the last line from Palin\u2019s most recent personal pot-shot at the President.\n\nI asked some left-leaning friends of mine what they thought of the skit upon sending them a YouTube link (already viewed over 1.3 million times): All responded similarly along the lines of, \u201cI\u2019m NO fan of Palin, but that was pretty funny.\u201d One even said, \u201cI forgot I hated her for a few minutes.\u201d\n\nThe appearance was in stark contrast to Letterman\u2019s take on the former Alaska governor, who once referred to Palin as having the style of a \u201cslutty flight attendant\u201d while joking her (then) 14-year-old daughter (Willow) had been \u201cknocked up by Alex Rodriguez.\u201d\n\nIn the end\u2014and especially after the Fallon clips go viral, and they all do\u2014each of the sketches from Palin to Romney to Obama (both men \u201cslow-jamming\u201d the news with the host as a white Barry White) all made everyone\u2014the guests, the host\u2014look good.

I will begin immediately working to restore the trust of those closest to me, and getting back to the important work that is required in the final days of session,\u201d he said.\n\nThe story has primarily gotten national media attention because it\u2019s so salacious. \u201cIntern\u201d plus \u201csext,\u201d after all, equals clicks.\n\nBut the scandal could have real public policy consequences, too.\n\nThat\u2019s because Missouri legislators are locked in a tense battle over a Right to Work bill that would bar businesses from requiring employees to pay union dues.\n\nMissouri would be the 26th state to implement that kind of legislation.\n\nWhile Republicans control both chambers of the Missouri legislature, a Democrat\u2014Jay Nixon\u2014is governor. And the Ferguson protests that gripped the nation last summer have left Nixon hobbled, according to Missouri politicos.\n\n\u201cNot only is he a lame duck, but he carries the legacy of Ferguson with him now wherever he goes,\u201d said Tim Jones, former Republican Speaker of the House. \u201cHe is vilified by Democrats and Republicans on nearly a daily basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving that dark cloud over the general assembly inhibits our ability to do the job which we\u2019re elected to do, which is to help Missourians,\u201d said Democratic Representative Gina Mitten.\n\nSince the St. Louis suburb became a metonym for everything that\u2019s wrong with American policing and race relations, the state\u2019s legislature hasn\u2019t been particularly kind to the governor.\n\nRepublican legislators have overridden his vetoes with alacrity, using their formidable majorities to implement a 72-hour waiting period for abortions and to allow gun owners with concealed-carry permits to openly carry their weapons anywhere in the state.\n\nThis is where Right to Work comes in.\n\nOn May 12, Republican state senators used an unusual procedural move to stop a filibuster on the Right to Work legislation and pass it through the chamber. Democrats raged against the move, an the Belleville News-Democrat reported that Republican Senator Bob Dixon criticized the action too.\n\nRepublicans in the legislature have been cautiously optimistic about their prospects of overturning Nixon\u2019s inevitable veto.\n\n\n\nThe initial votes on the bill didn\u2019t pass with the requisite two-thirds majorities per chamber to guarantee an override. And corralling the necessary votes won\u2019t be a walk in the park. To get the override, Republicans would need 23 votes in the Senate\u2014where it initially passed 21-13\u2014and 109 votes in the House, where 91 members voted for Right to Work in February.\n\nThough Republicans have two-thirds majorities in both chambers, some of those members of their members don\u2019t relish backing the controversial legislation. Getting enough stragglers on board with the legislation will likely take blood, sweat, tears, and a lot of arm-twisting. Assuming Nixon vetoes Right to Work (an iminently safe assumption), the legislature would vote to override sometime in September.\n\nThat\u2019s why Diehl\u2019s sexting fiasco matters.\n\nThanks to a tawdry relationship, House Republicans have a time-consuming, soul-sucking mess on their hands. As of late afternoon Wednesday, 30 of the chamber\u2019s Democrats had signed a petition that would force a vote requiring Diehl to step down as Speaker.

That would force the chamber\u2019s top Republicans to scramble for new leadership in the midst of an aggressive lobbying effort in favor of the historic anti-union legislation.\n\nAnd it would make everything more complicated.\n\nOpponents of Right to Work are crossing their fingers that it will play out that way. Jeff Mazur, the executive director of AFSCME Council 72 in Jefferson City, said he doubted Republicans would be able to get the votes regardless.\n\nBut, he added, the sexting scandal is only helpful to the pro-labor side.\n\nState Representative Gail McCann Beatty, the assistant minority floor leader, said she was agnostic as to how the now-public sexts could impact the fate of Right to Work.

He has no political experience but Republicans now say that doesn\u2019t seem to matter.\n\nDr. Ben Carson became an instant conservative folk hero on Feb. 7, 2013, when, as a featured speaker at the National Prayer Breakfast, he upbraided President Obama for inflicting Obamacare on the nation\u2014this, as the president sat poker-faced mere feet from him on the dais.\n\nCarson\u2019s moment in the sun spawned an entire movement on the right urging him to run for the White House himself. Ann Coulter called him \u201cmagnificent.\u201d The Wall Street Journal published an editorial titled, \u201cBen Carson for President.\u201d\n\nThe right\u2019s Carson-mania will likely explode in full force with the publication Tuesday of his hardcover manifesto, One Nation: What We Can All Do to Save America\u2019s Future\u2014which sounds suspiciously like a campaign document.\n\nBut truth be told, the right-wing frisson was generated not only because an ordinary citizen dared to criticize the leader of the free world to his face, but also because both men are African-American.\n\nLike Herman Cain, briefly the frontrunner for the 2012 Republican nomination until his campaign was derailed by sexual harassment charges (not to mention his obvious lack of policy chops), the good doctor stands as a right-wing rebuke to the political clich\u00e9 that liberal-Democrat economic and social policies serve the interests of African Americans, and conservative-Republican policies undermine those interests.\n\nConservatives have long claimed, with some justification, that liberals favor policies\u2014particularly affirmative action\u2014which tend to patronize and demean blacks. It is an article of faith that President Obama has been given a free ride by the liberal media, in part, because of his race. And as Coulter so memorably put it in her attempt to defend Cain, \u201cOur blacks are so much better than their blacks\u201d because \u201cyou have fought against probably your family, probably your neighbors\u2026that\u2019s why we have very impressive blacks.\u201d\n\nCarson, a neurosurgeon by training, is perilously close to becoming the Herman Cain of 2016\u2014but with a scalpel instead of a pizza cutter.\n\nIn its gushing endorsement, The Wall Street Journal argued that Carson \u201cmay not be politically correct but he\u2019s closer to correct than anyone we\u2019ve heard in years.\u201d But the evidence is thin that the retired doctor\u2014who in his prime was brilliant at his profession, even successfully separating conjoined twins\u2014is one of the foremost political thinkers of the age. In his speech to the National Prayer Breakfast\u2014the thing that so excited the Journal\u2019s editorial writers\u2014Carson pushed health savings accounts and a flat tax. Those ideas are hardly original; indeed, they are Republican boilerplate.\n\nCarson harps on again and again is that the nation has fallen prey to quasi-fascist forces of \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore generally, how could anyone who judges him solely on his merits possibly think Carson is qualified to be president? He has never held political office. He has never run a major organization or business.\n\nIt\u2019s rather curious when conservatives push Carson for high office, given that they repeatedly complained in 2008 that Obama was woefully inexperienced\u2014a \u201ccommunity organizer.\u201d The typical sneer was that Obama had never even run a candy store. Yet when Sen. Obama of Illinois ran for president he had held two more public offices than Carson ever has.\n\nConservatives were equally dismissive of the Rev. Jesse Jackson when he sought the presidency in 1984 and 1988. In 1988, George Will famously asked Jackson a ridiculously esoteric question on ABC's This Week\u2014whether he would support something known as the Louvre Accord\u2014which seemed conspicuously designed to make Jackson look both ignorant and unqualified.\n\nJackson, at least, had been involved in public life since the early 1960s. Carson has almost no record of prior involvement as a political participant, let alone an activist. Nor, until recently, did he venture into punditry.\n\nHe also has no editing experience. He has no journalism experience. But that didn\u2019t stop the right-leaning Washington Times from appointing Carson as the publisher of a new online magazine for black conservatives\u2014and giving him a weekly op-ed column. It was inevitable when the Fox News Channel\u2014which likes to have prospective Republican presidential candidates on its roster of paid analysts--put Carson under contract.\n\nI\u2019ve read all of Carson\u2019s Washington Times op-eds since his column debuted in July 2013. He strikes me as a pedestrian thinker. He has none of the subtlety and nuance of black conservative academics such as Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams.\n\nInstead, Carson tends to alternate between inflammatory arguments and threadbare truisms. His April 22 op-ed argued that the \u201cmassive show of force\u201d by the government against rancher Cliven Bundy foreshadowed the \u201ctotalitarian regime\u201d that awaits Americans if they do not safeguard their precious freedoms, particularly the Second Amendment. The depiction of Bundy as a brave, if slightly zealous, victim of government authority was published one day before the New York Times quoted his racist rant that \u201cthe Negro\u201d was better off during slavery. Carson offered no subsequent condemnation.\n\nHe also has a rather skewed perspective on slavery. Carson has called Obamacare the \u201cworst thing that has happened in this country since slavery.\u201d This is the kind of inversion of history that conservatives attack when perpetrated by the left. It is the moral equivalent of Jesse Jackson saying that the Tea Party \u201cis the resurrection of the Confederacy.\u201d\n\nBut the theme Carson harps on again and again is that the nation has fallen prey to quasi-fascist forces of \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d leaving Americans frightened of dissent from liberal orthodoxy.\n\nCarson recently said on Breitbart TV\u2014after wowing a gathering of conservatives in Manhattan\u2014that rampant political correctness has turned the United States of America into something like Nazi Germany. \u201cI mean, [we are] very much like Nazi Germany. And I know you\u2019re not supposed to say \u2018Nazi Germany,\u2019 but I don\u2019t care about political correctness. You know, you had a government using its tools to intimidate the population. We now live in a society where people are afraid to say what they actually believe.\u201d\n\nWhy would conservatives embrace someone who makes the argument\u2014long a staple of the left\u2014that creeping fascism is engulfing this country? And just who exactly is being silenced by political correctness? Carson himself certainly does not lack for platforms.\n\nThe term \u201cwhite guilt,\u201d which is now part of the vernacular, connotes a liberal who is so wracked by past injustices that he reflexively overlooks or apologizes for abominable conduct by individual African-Americans\u2014or he tacitly accepts the soft bigotry of the official language of \u201cinner-city pathologies.\u201d\n\nBut Ben Carson is a different case-study: He demonstrates that conservatives can also be remarkably patronizing toward blacks\u2014especially those who, no matter how vapid or tendentious, lean rightward.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:35.875+0000"}
{"entityId": 1811, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "In November 2012, U.S. voter turnout was 58 percent. And on Saturday, Afghan turnout was about the same\u2014in the face of dire threats and violence. What does that say about our democracy?\n\nWhat would you be willing to risk in order to vote? Would you cast a ballot if it meant your finger might be cut off? Would you head to the polls if there were a credible threat that terrorists were going to blow up your polling station? Would you even leave your house on Election Day if terrorists threatened to kill people who voted?\n\nI doubt I would risk that much. But those were the dangers the people of Afghanistan faced as they went to the polls Saturday to determine who would succeed President Hamid Karzai.\n\nWhat do you think the voter turnout was in Saturday\u2019s election in Afghanistan? But before you answer, let me give you a bit more information about what the Afghan people endured in the run-up to the vote.\n\nThe Taliban ordered 39 suicide bombings in the two months leading up to the election. The Taliban also circulated letters warning Afghans that if they voted, they could have a finger chopped off or even be killed.\n\nJust three days before the election, a Taliban suicide bomber killed seven people. And on Tuesday, a candidate for a provincial office and nine of his supporters were kidnapped and killed by the Taliban.\n\nAli Soufan, a former FBI agent and CEO of The Soufan Group, called the Taliban\u2019s actions a concerted effort to derail the elections. And in case you think the media were exaggerating the threats against the Afghan people, a U.S. Army officer who recently returned from Afghanistan told me, \u201cThe people out there are scared as hell of the Taliban.\u201d\n\nSo now, keeping all that in mind, how many Afghans do you think risked life and limb to cast their ballot? Keep in mind that in our 2012 presidential election, we had a 58 percent voter turnout.\n\nEarly estimates are that 7 million courageous Afghans voted, a number that represents a 58 percent voter turnout. That\u2019s considerably higher than the 4.5 million Afghans who voted in their last election, in 2009.\n\nThe high voter turnout in Afghanistan tells me two things. First, despite what many on the right will tell you, there are people in the Muslim world who embrace democracy. While Muslims are in no way monolithic, clearly the 7 million Afghans who risked their lives to vote are a shining example of people who very much want democracy. As a side note, anyone who tells you all Muslims think a certain way on any issue understands nothing about Muslims. When you see those people on Fox \u201cNews,\u201d change the channel because they are making you dumber.\n\nMy second takeaway is that our voter turnout is pathetic. The Afghans voted despite the Taliban\u2019s threats of murder. What\u2019s the biggest thing we risk to vote? Maybe missing an episode of The Big Bang Theory or Keeping Up with the Kardashians?\n\nYet in our 2010 midterm elections, in which we elected all 435 members of the House, 37 U.S. senators, and local officials around the country, voter turnout was just 41 percent. Worse still, Texas had an anemic 32 percent turnout and Tennessee was close behind at 34 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s right\u2014in 2010 so few people voted that we were in danger of not even being a democracy.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that we will see an even lower turnout in this November\u2019s midterm elections. And don\u2019t be surprised if the numbers keep trending downward in the years to come.\n\nThere\u2019s an overall sense that voting is meaningless, thanks in large part to the conservative justices on the U.S. Supreme Court who over the past few years, including last week, have rendered decisions that give the wealthy and large corporations much more influence in our elections. As I wrote last week, these court rulings have made an increasing number of Americans distrust our government; alarmingly, 26 percent of those polled in a 2012 study by the Brennan Center for Justice said they were less likely to vote.\n\nAdd to that the push by some Republican officials to curtail early voting and enact voter ID laws that studies say will reduce voter turnout further. Republicans claim these laws are to protect the \u201cintegrity\u201d of our elections. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s their concern, just as the conservative Supreme Court justices who invalidated campaign finance laws did so to protect the average American\u2019s right to participate in our democracy by giving the rich and big business even more influence in elections.\n\nIn Afghanistan, the 2014 election is over but the fight for democracy continues. On Sunday, two election workers were killed by a roadside bomb that also destroyed some ballots. But in six weeks, the Afghan people will have the results of an election that was truly a profile in courage.\n\nIn our case, however, questions remain. Can we find a way to inspire people to vote and engage in our democracy? If not and voter turnout keeps falling, at what point will we no longer be able to say with a straight face that we are a democracy?", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:36.733+0000"}
{"entityId": 1812, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Chicago\u2019s mayor allegedly blew up when he was asked why he closed clinics. Looks like \u2018Rahmbo\u2019 is back.\n\nThey say old Rahm Emanuel came out last night\u2014or maybe it was the real one hiding in plain sight all the time: a sneering, aggressive pol who went \u201cnose-to-nose\u201d with a mental-health advocate demanding, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna respect me!\u201d\n\nThe alleged exchange took place off-camera between Chicago\u2019s mayor and Matt Ginsberg-Jaeckle, a member of Mental Health Movement, a group that has been fighting the mayor over the closure of six mental health clinics across the city. Behind a door that separated the mayor from a roomful of constituents at a campaign stop in the Wicker Park neighborhood, Ginsberg-Jaeckle says, he got Rahmbo\u2019d.\n\n\u201cThis is the Real Rahm,\u201d Ginsberg-Jaeckle wrote on Facebook. \u201cCalm and collected in public, raging angry and self-defensive behind closed doors.\u201d\n\nBut Emanuel's campaign, while not directly refuting the mayor's alleged call for respect, said the exchange was more cordial than Ginsberg-Jaeckle's version of events. The mayor's office has reached out Ginsberg-Jaeckle and Delgado to address their concerns, campaign spokesman Steve Mayberry said in a statement.\n\n\"The mayor was eager to get to the substance of the residents' concerns,\" Mayberry said via email. \"After respectfully listening to the residents, he asked that they respectfully listen to his point of view. As a result, the meeting ended cordially and the mayor is working with health officials to address the residents' needs.\"\n\n\n\nDebbie Delgado, another member of the group, interrupted Emanuel, prompting the behind-closed-doors altercation.\n\n\u201cShe told of losing her son to gun violence,\u201d Ginsberg-Jaeckle wrote. \u201cShe told [Emanuel] how her other son was holding him as he died. She told about how the city's Northwest Mental Health Clinic in Logan Square saved their lives, helped her and her son deal with the PTSD and depression. Then she asked why he took that clinic away from her.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s said that Rahm went DeNiro in The Untouchables on the people who had opposed them. \u201cDead!\u201d he screamed while plunging a steak knife into a table.\n\nRahm said he would speak with the pair, and Ginsberg-Jaeckle said they then left the room for a private conversation. That\u2019s when Emanuel allegedly shouted: \u201cYou\u2019re gonna respect me!\u201d\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office wouldn\u2019t address the supposed angry exchange.\n\n\u201cSince it was a non-city event there were no city people there to witness it,\u201d said Chloe Rasmas, a spokesperson for the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nRasmas said that, because the event was for Rahm\u2019s re-election campaign, now in run-off mode, the mayor\u2019s office wouldn\u2019t comment on what happened behind closed doors. Apparently there is an official distinction to be made between Mayor Rahm and Candidate Rahm.\n\nEmanuel\u2019s temper is notorious. In 1992, he was Bill Clinton\u2019s chief fundraiser. After Bubba won the White House, it\u2019s said that Rahm went DeNiro in The Untouchables on the people who had opposed them. \u201cDead!\u201d Rahm screamed while plunging a steak knife into a table. ''Nat Landow! Dead! Cliff Jackson! Dead! Bill Schaefer! Dead!'' Rahm\u2019s rage-fueled drive later propelled him to a seat in Congress and the position of White House chief of staff under President Obama.\n\nThe toughest political fight of Rahmbo\u2019s career though is winning a second term as mayor. Emanuel is facing an April run-off against Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia after the failing to secure more than 50 percent of the vote in last month\u2019s Democratic primary.. Among the contentious issues consuming Chicago politics are the mayor\u2019s decision to close several public schools, install controversial red-light cameras, fail to stamp out gun violence and, for some like Ginsberg-Jaeckle, closing of six mental-health clinics.\n\nFor years Ginsberg-Jaeckle, Debbie Delgado and other members of the group have been trying to meet with Rahm. First, to convince him not to close the six mental health clinics that were eventually shut down. Then it was to re-open the clinics, which provide services Ginsberg-Jaeckle and Delgado say are badly needed in neighborhoods plagued by violence and poverty. The closures created enemies for the mayor, the members of Mental Health Movement among them.\n\nAs longtime pain-in-Rahm\u2019s-ass Ben Joravsky puts it, the mayor might be better off running for the \u201cmost unlikeable man in Chicago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been trying since he was campaigning the first time to meet with him on the mental health issue,\u201d Ginsberg-Jaeckle said.\n\nAnd failing. Ginsberg-Jaeckle and Delgaod finally got their moment Wednesday night, after the pair interrupted an otherwise outing campaign stop in Wicker Park.\n\n\u201cI found it to be inappropriate,\u201d said Ronda Locke of Rahm\u2019s response. Locke, a former city council candidate, snapped a photo during the exchange. In her campaign for first ward alderwoman, Locke advocated for keeping the clinics open, but said she attended the meeting Wednesday night only as a resident of the area.\n\n\u201cI thought, initially, he handled it very well,\u201d Locke said of the interruption prompted by Ginsberg-Jaeckle and Delgado. \u201cBut as (Rahm) was leaving the room, he said something to the effect of \u2018Please excuse my special guests.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Rahm was making a play on the word special, or was just being a smart-ass, Locke said. Either way he came off smarmy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking in some poorly thought out way he was just attempting to be cute, but it came out in a way that diminished their cause and diminished their efforts,\u201d Locke said of Ginsberg-Jaeckle and Delgado.\n\nLocke speculated that Rahm\u2019s attempt to put on a smooth public face was the result of a new, more cuddly, campaign strategy. But it just didn\u2019t work very well Wednesday night. And it doesn\u2019t really matter how nice the mayor is in public if, behind closed doors, he\u2019s screaming at people and getting in their faces. Then again, this is Chicago, home of former mayor Richard Daley\u2019s infamous \u2014 or famous, depending on your political preference\u2014machine.\n\nGinsberg-Jaeckle said he feels he\u2019s outside that machinery, although he noted that the last Mayor Daley kept the clinics open after Mental Health Movement and others \u201cmade their wheels squeaky enough\u201d for the mayor to grease them. The group hasn\u2019t had the same luck with Rahm, and Wednesday night\u2019s interruption was an act of desperation resulting from years of closed doors and unanswered phone calls, Ginsberg-Jaeckle said.\n\n\u201cWe delivered 10,000 letters to the mayor\u2019s office in October 2012. They didn\u2019t respond. So, we started sending one email a week. No response. We held forums and protests. The day before a vote on the budget we did a sit-in outside the mayor\u2019s office, and they forced us out by cutting off any access bathrooms,\u201d Ginsberg-Jaeckle said, running down years\u2019 worth of attempts to talk with the mayor.\n\n\u201cI could go play by play, but long story short we could not get through to this man. Finally, the extreme we reached was crashing his events.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what they did Wednesday night, not expecting much other than to be escorted out. Locke said Rahm told police to hold off when Ginsberg-Jaeckle and Delgado rose from their front-row chairs to confront the mayor. It was all cordial, until the trio left the room.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:37.217+0000"}

Enough were there, however, to show a party at war with itself.\n\nTo the right of the entrance inside the exhibit hall at the Republican Leadership Conference, a semi-annual gathering of conservative activists in New Orleans, is a shooting range. To the left is a T-shirt stand.\n\nThe gun range is nothing alarming\u2014a plastic contraption with a toy pistol aiming at a series of targets a few feet away. It is there to drum up interest in a political polling business setting up shop in the hall and seems to be fulfilling its purpose. On the first afternoon of the three-day confab, as guests are still strolling in, the booth already has attracted a crowd.\n\n\u201cPretend they\u2019re Democrats, Margaret!\u201d one man shouts to his wife, who is decked out in a red cowboy hat and American flag scarf.\n\nAcross the way, the T-shirt booth seems to be doing fine, too, selling tops with slogans like \u201cWhen Is It My Turn to Be Offended?\u201d and \u201cNEVER Apologize for Being an American.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that wonderful?\u201d says Jan Hamming, a 70-year-old tax administrator from western Michigan, holding up a black tank top bearing the image of an assault rife and the words \u201cI don\u2019t call 9/11.\u201d\n\nSmall and slight, she looks nothing like the media\u2019s idea of a gun nut but says she grew up on farm in Michigan and is a lifetime member of the NRA. And she has driven, with her husband, 1,100 miles to be here. \u201cThe situation with our government has just gotten so bad,\u201d she says. The RLC advertises itself as the first stop on the road to 2016, and Hamming is here to be appealed to. She likes Donald Trump, \u201ca conservative, Christian family man,\u201d but wants to hear more from everyone.\n\n\u201cI work in a good, family-oriented, Christian company,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it works. Everybody who is there wants to be there.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo unions!\u201d her husband chimes in.\n\nAsked why 1,500 conservative activists are hunkering down in the basement ballrooms of the Riverside Hilton for the event, Hamming says, \u201cTo rally the troops.\u201d\n\nOn and on it went, for hours on end, one side urging conservatives to throw the impure out of the temple, the other advocating for a bigger tent to defeat the Democrats.\n\nIt is as good an answer as any. Although the RLC, which ran May 29-31, sees itself as the 2016 campaign\u2019s first stop, most of the GOP\u2019s heavy hitters for 2016 kept their distance. There was no Jeb Bush, no Rand Paul, no Marco Rubio, no Scott Walker, no Paul Ryan, no Chris Christie, no Mike Huckabee. There were a few legitimate contenders, such as Rick Perry and Ted Cruz, but the roster was filled mostly with the fringes of even the conservative movement.\n\nPhil Robertson, the patriarch of the Duck Dynasty family and franchise, who became a hero to the right after he was nearly drummed off the air for wondering aloud about the relative merits of homosexual versus heterosexual sex, was honored with a keynote speaking slot. Indicted author Dinesh D\u2019Souza was a \u201cSurprise Guest.\u201d Shaun McCutcheon, the businessman who sued in order to rip apart the last vestiges of the campaign finance system, served as an MC. Members of Congress including Allan West, Louie Gohmert, and Steve King\u2014who made the case that Hillary Clinton lied about Benghazi\u2014were there, too, as were ghosts of presidential races, such as Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, and Herman Cain, who hinted that he was looking to run again after his last race cratered so spectacularly. Michele Bachmann, a soon-to-be ex-member of Congress and a failed presidential candidate in her own right, bailed out at the last minute.\n\nPart of the confusion was perhaps baked in. The Republican Leadership Conference was at one time the Southern Republican Leadership Conference. It dropped the geographic distinction, I was told by a conference official, in order to avoid seeming like a party of the old, white and narrow-minded, and also to avoid leaving its home base of New Orleans and rotate locations around the South. Another group had then booted up under the old name, leading to confusion about which southern conservative get-together was which.\n\nBut if the origins were unclear, so was much of the point of the gathering.\n\n\u201cI will let you know when I found out,\u201d said Johnnie Williams, 68, a retired Army vet who fled Louisiana for Florida after Katrina, when asked why he was attending. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s because I was invited.\u201d\n\nThe gathering arrived at a time when the conservative movement is as unsure of itself as it has been in at least the last five years, and perhaps even longer. The Tea Party, at least as an electoral force, seems to have run its course, tallying up a string of defeats from Oregon to New Jersey. In some cases, Tea Partiers have upended establishment opponents only to embarrass themselves, and conservatives, on a bigger stage.\n\nNext door, in Mississippi, the Tea Party is trying to make a last stand by knocking off Thad Cochran, a genteel 76-year-old incumbent, with Chris McDaniel, a conservative commentator three decades Cochran\u2019s junior who all but promised to bring the U.S. Senate to its knees. Closer to home, in Louisiana, Rep. Bill Cassidy seemed to have a decent chance of defeating Democrat Mary Landrieu in November\u2019s Senate race. A pesky state lawmaker named Rob Maness, however, has refused to drop out of the primary, despite entreaties from no less a party statesman than Trump, who was prowling around the Hilton for part of the RLC. \u201cMy advice is, prior to the election, you gotta get these people together. You can\u2019t have somebody taking 8 percent of the vote who\u2019s a conservative,\u201d Trump told the press. \u201cI know you think you\u2019re going to take that 8 percent and win an election, but that\u2019s not what history shows.\u201d\n\nStill Maness soldiered on, appearing with Sarah Palin just as the convention was getting started, in an upstairs room at the hotel at a rally, where he began to get weepy as he described a nation that was without the red state/blue state divide\u2014a notion that was, of course, popularized by Barack Obama, but one that also, on this occasion at least, got Palin crying, too.\n\nIt was hard not to get mixed messages from the rostrum, too. One minute Republican National Committee chairman Reince Preibus would be on stage, lamenting that the party had split in two\u2014\u201cWe have a midterm party that doesn\u2019t lose, and we have a presidential party that\u2019s having a hard time winning\u201d\u2014and calling the series of debates in 2012 that helped launched Bachmann and Cain \u201ca traveling circus.\u201d\n\nThe next minute, Bobby Jindal would come on stage, accusing President Obama of an \u201cassault on religious liberty,\u201d comparing the Common Core education standards to New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg\u2019s attempted soda ban, and calling Obama a redistributionist whose policies would create \u201can American nightmare.\u201d\n\nThen it would be Phil Robertson\u2019s turn, haranguing the audience to get right with God and urging that the Bible be taught in schools to bring down the crime rate. Ron Johnson, a one-time Tea Party senator from Wisconsin, would come next, sounding like he had seen the light.\n\n\u201cI think the conservative movement may just be maturing a little bit. You can be very doctrinaire, you can demand purity, but in the end if you want to advance policy that you want enacted, you have to win elections,\u201d he said, adding what sounded like a slight dig at the Duck family: \u201cIf you start out bombastic, if you start out with conspiracies, they aren\u2019t going to listen to you.\u201d\n\nOn and on it went, for hours on end, one side urging conservatives to throw the impure out of the temple, the other advocating for a bigger tent to defeat the Democrats.\n\nIn the evening, there would be a brief d\u00e9tente.

{"entityId": 1814, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "From gay rights to voter-ID laws, this attorney general became the man to fight the way the president couldn\u2019t. Yet his liberal voice was too often silenced on War on Terror issues.\n\nEric Holder has been a historic attorney general. Not only is he the first African American to hold the position, but he is the fourth-longest-serving attorney general in our nation\u2019s history, behind only William Wirt (1817-1829), Janet Reno (1993-2001), and Homer Cummings (1933-1939).\n\nA product of the civil-rights era, Holder has consistently been one of the most liberal voices in the Obama administration. From voting rights to gay rights to the rights of people accused of a crime, Holder hasn\u2019t hesitated to advance progressive positions in a White House that has sometimes been reluctant to do so for fear of inciting ever-more-vitriolic attacks by right-wing pundits and politicians. Holder has also frequently spoken out publicly about racial issues in our nation with a boldness that often was not politically realistic for the president. In so doing, Holder has made important contributions to public discourse and public understanding on matters that cut to the very heart of American democracy.\n\nIn the voting-rights arena, Eric Holder has been the most effective attorney general in decades. He has filed multiple lawsuits challenging the legality of both state redistricting plans and state voter-ID laws that were clearly designed to disenfranchise millions of minority voters. Condemning such laws as reminiscent of the era of Jim Crow, Holder pledged \u201cto honor the generations\u201d of Americans who took \u201cextraordinary risks\u201d to win the right to vote. Along similar lines, Holder also substantially revitalized the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, which had been largely gutted under President George W. Bush.\n\nIn the realm of equal rights for gays and lesbians, Holder announced in early 2011 that the Justice Department would no longer defend the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a course of action he had strongly advocated to the president. Holder had concluded, as the Supreme Court did two years later, that the Defense of Marriage Act could not be squared with the commands of the United States Constitution. Moreover, under Eric Holder the Justice Department has vigorously enforced the landmark Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, and moved quickly to implement the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision in Windsor v. United States, making federal marriage benefits available to same-sex couples who are legally married under state law.\n\nAs the Human Rights Campaign has observed, \u201cSome attorneys general wait for history, others make history happen. Attorney General Holder has made history for the LGBT community.\u201d He has been, the HRC declared, \u201cour Robert F. Kennedy, lightening the burden of every American who faces legal discrimination and social oppression.\u201d\n\nOn issues relating to the War of Terror, though, Eric Holder\u2019s positions have often disappointed his civil-libertarian friends and allies. On some of these issues, Holder has taken forceful pro-civil-libertarian positions, condemning the Bush administration\u2019s use of torture, strongly supporting the closing of Guantanamo Bay, and advocating the prosecution of suspected terrorists in civilian rather than military courts.\n\nMuch of this has been pure, or more accurately, impure, political theater. Republicans have inexcusably held him in contempt of Congress\u2014the first time in American history that Congress has ever held an attorney general in contempt.\n\nOn a range of other terrorism-related issues, however, Holder has defended the legality of programs and positions that civil libertarians deplore. These include, among others, approval of investigations and prosecutions of government employees and contractors who leak classified information, approval of the issuance of subpoenas directed at journalists who publish leaked classified information, approval of the use of drones to kill suspected terrorists (including an American citizen), approval of the NSA\u2019s telephone metadata program, approval of the use of the state-secrets privilege to shield the secrecy of classified national-security programs, and approval of presidential authority to engage in military actions without congressional consent.\n\nOn issues like these, Holder has no doubt found himself torn between his natural civil-libertarian inclinations and the awesome responsibility of keeping our nation safe from a terrorist attack. Perhaps the central question here is whether Holder has put in place the necessary safeguards to review, reconsider, and reevaluate these programs on an ongoing basis after they were initially instituted. On this score, my sense from having served as a member of the President\u2019s Review Group\u2014which was charged with evaluating at least some of these programs\u2014is that the oversight mechanisms were good, but could and should have been better. As a result, at least some programs have been approved that should at the very least have been more carefully narrowed.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Attorney General Holder, like the president he serves, has been the target of indefensible and unprecedented attacks by Republican members of Congress. Much of this has been pure, or more accurately, impure, political theater. Republicans have inexcusably held him in contempt of Congress\u2014the first time in American history that Congress has ever held an attorney general in contempt. Moreover, without any credible justification, they have even gone so far as to call for impeachment proceedings against him. Through it all, though, Holder has maintained his composure and remained focused on his legal and constitutional responsibilities.\n\nAt a meeting several years ago with Attorney General Holder, I was struck that he had prominently displayed in the Attorney General\u2019s Conference Room a magnificent portrait of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. I reflected at the time that this might be because Holder hoped that, like RFK, he would be able to use his authority to advance the cause of freedom, justice, and equality during his tenure.

We cannot let it continue,\u201d Trump said, adding that if he were elected president, \u201cwe will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with winning.\u201d\n\nIt was a study of the contrasts that would emerge in a race between Clinton and Trump: substance versus style.\n\nHillary\u2019s speech, given hours before the rally, might as well have been on a different planet.\n\n\u201cOnly in an Orwellian Obama world full of sprinkly fairy dust blown from atop a unicorn as he\u2019s peeking through a really pretty pink kaleidoscope would he ever see victory or safety for America or Israel in this treaty.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile Palin and Trump talked unicorns and winning, Clinton spoke to a think tank crowd about the need for the next president to deepen the United States\u2019s commitment to Israel, sustain a robust military presence in the Middle East, expand sanctions against Iran for terrorism and build a coalition to counter Iranian influence.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that it accomplishes the major goals we set out to achieve. It blocks every pathway for Iran to get a bomb, and it gives us better tools for verification and inspection and to compel rigorous compliance,\u201d the 2016 Democratic hopeful argued.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the Capitol, the push to block the deal was quickly losing steam as House Republicans struggled to find the cohesiveness and support needed to advance a resolution rejecting the Iran deal.\n\nThe House was expected to begin the process of considering a resolution to reject the White House deal, but conservatives in the House revolted, arguing that the Obama administration had not produced \u201csecret deals\u201d made between the International Atomic Energy Agency and Iran.\n\nIn the Senate, the effort to block the Iran deal also looked stuck. Soft support for the measure meant that Democratic allies of President Obama could feasibly filibuster it, preventing a vote on the matter. In order to overcome procedural hurdles in the Senate, 60 senators must vote to advance debate, and it is in doubt whether opponents of the Iran deal have the numbers.\n\n\u201cThe Senate appears stuck and House GOP members are fired up about the secret IAEA side deals. They don\u2019t think Obama has complied with [a bill requiring the administration present all documents related to the Iran deal].

But the Texas Senator has got some disclosure issues of his own to fess up to.\n\nLast week, would-be Republican presidential nominee Ted Cruz tore in to Hillary Clinton for having sacrificed America\u2019s national security while the Clinton Foundation was reportedly benefiting from millions in foreign largesse. Yet, Cruz\u2019s stridency belies the fact that Cruz has his own foreign money and transparency problems, and that his campaign has refused to respond to inquiries from The Daily Beast about his business dealings. Like the Bonnie and Clyde of Little Rock, it appears that Cruz too has a penchant for crony capitalism and foreign money, and a disdain for disclosure.\n\nUnderstandably, Cruz has no interest about talking about his own brushes with the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, his own spotty financial, his ties to Caribbean Equity Partners Limited, a Caribbean investment vehicle, or to CEP\u2019s principal, David Panton. You see, as a Senate candidate in 2012, Cruz was required by law to come clean publicly about his holdings and finances\u2014except that, according to a report in Time magazine, he didn\u2019t, or at least not immediately\u2014that is, not until Time forced Cruz\u2019s hand.\n\nFor the record, Cruz did not initially own up to the fact that CEP owed him money, and then further messed up by failing to make a complete disclosure about CEP\u2019s indebtedness, according to Time\u2019s review of Cruz\u2019s congressional filings. Indeed, in an October 21, 2013 letter to the Secretary of the Senate, Cruz acknowledged that his 2012 financial disclosures \u201cinadvertently omitted certain financial information.\u201d (PDF)\n\nBut for Cruz, all that is just so yesterday. Panton, who was Cruz\u2019s best man at his wedding, is now a driving force of a Cruz super-PAC, named Stand for Principle. Panton described his relationship with Cruz this way to the Jamaica Observer: \u201cI speak with and see Ted frequently as a close friend, but deliberately do not discuss his campaign strategy.\u201d Panton added, \u201cAs an active supporter of a super-Pac that supports him, I am not able to discuss campaign strategy with him.\u201d\n\nAll this would be interesting enough, except for the fact that Panton is the son of the late Keith Panton, a Jamaican cabinet officer who was also the former head of Alcan Jamaica. And it gets even better. David Panton was a member of the Jamaican Senate until he resigned in 2004 to pursue a career in finance in the United States, and the Panton family was tight with Jamaica\u2019s former Prime Minister, Edward Seaga, and with the Jamaican Labor Party, which had its own issues and ties to drugs and violence. Traditional family values, indeed.\n\nSo how did Cruz come to know the Pantons, what exactly was CEP, and how much did Cruz actually profit? Cruz first met David Panton at Princeton, where the pair were roommates and members of the school\u2019s debating team. As Panton told The Daily Beast two years ago, \u201cUnlike what others may say, I consider Ted to be very kind. He is a very, very gentle-hearted person \u2026 He took me under his wing and was a mentor to me. He was very kind to me. I am a much smarter and much better person today because of Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Cruz, a dual- national until he got called-out, sees no parallel to Hillary when he looks into the mirror.\n\nThe two would then move on to Harvard Law School, where Panton would be the second African American to be elected president of the Harvard Law Review. Like Cruz\u2019s father, Panton\u2019s father was also a minister, albeit in the Anglican Church.\n\nAs for CEP, it was established in 1998, and Cruz was one of CEP\u2019s founding directors and shareholders, according to Time. Cruz had invested $6,000 in CEP, but watched that sum grow to $100,000 when he cashed out in November 2002 (PDF). For his troubles, Cruz received $25,000 up front, and a $75,000 IOU from Panton\u2019s firm, CEP Investments Holdings Limited, Kingston, Jamaica, which is presently valued by Cruz to be worth between $100,000 and $250,000 (PDF), once a \u201creasonable rate of interest\u201d is factored in to the equation (PDF), according to Cruz\u2019s congressional financial disclosures, made available at the Open Secrets web site.\n\nStill, for his part, Cruz would like the world to believe that CEP was just another private equity fund. Except CEP wasn\u2019t any old private equity fund. Heck, to the untrained eye, CEP looks awfully like Hillary Clinton\u2019s old cattle futures investment, where she parlayed $1,000 into $99,540, courtesy of James Blair, a Clinton crony and the top lawyer of Arkansas-based Tysons Foods, America\u2019s largest poultry company.\n\nHere\u2019s what I mean. CEP seemed to be about as crony-capitalist an arrangement as it could get. For all intents and purposes, CEP could have been called Jamaica\u2019s version of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. CEP managed an investment fund established by the Jamaican government, which received investment backing from the Caribbean Development Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, according to The Gleaner, a Jamaican newspaper.\n\nAlso according to The Gleaner, in 2000 CEP and \u201cCaribbean Basin Investors Limited (CBIL) \u2026 recently formed the Caribbean Investment Fund to make investments in the 14 member countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \u2026 Caribbean Equity Partners will manage the Fund on behalf of CBIL and the Fund\u2019s investors.\u201d Oh, and while CEP was doing its thing in the Caribbean, Cruz was working on the 2000 Bush campaign, and would be rewarded for his troubles with appointments at the Department of Justice as Associate Deputy Attorney General, and then at the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nTo be clear, there was nothing illegal about CEP managing the fund. But for Cruz, who was a Bush political appointee at DOJ and the FTC, to simultaneously hold an interest in an offshore semi-sovereign investment vehicle raises questions, especially when he was there at the fund\u2019s genesis. Indeed, when Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi Nelson Cruz, joined Treasury, both she and Cruz were forced to offload their holdings because they could have given rise to a conflict of interest, and CEP was one of those holdings, according to Time.\n\nWhether Cruz is proud of profiting from a crony capitalist venture is not known, as his campaign has declined to comment to The Daily Beast. But one thing\u2019s for sure, he despises it in others, or at least when the game is played north of Jamaica. At CPAC 2014 Cruz announced, \u201cWashington is corrupt. There is a corrupt and inter-locking system of lobbyists and lawyers and consultants that are suckling off Washington \u2026 We need to end the corruption. We need to end corporate welfare and crony capitalism.\u201d\n\nThen just last week, Cruz told Breitbart, \u201cHillary Clinton embodies the culture of corruption in Washington, where politicians enrich themselves and expand their own power\u2014Washington only gets more and more powerful\u2014and the lives of hardworking Americans get harder and harder and harder. Of course, Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation should return the money they received from foreign nations particularly when she was Secretary of State.\u201d\n\nCruz is spot-on when he takes Clinton to task.

I haven\u2019t seen it in person, but a quick perusal of Google Images confirms the BMO Harris Bradley Center looks like it was built as an homage to maximum-security prisons.\n\nSo the Bucks are getting a new arena, thanks to a deal the state\u2019s legislature recently approved. And Governor Scott Walker has committed to signing it\u2014a move that has the potential to raise questions on the campaign trail, both because of who the deal directly benefits (a major Hillary Clinton donor) and what it costs taxpayers (at least a cool $250 million ).\n\nWalker has consistently defended the deal, arguing that it\u2019s a net gain for taxpayers because it will protect revenues that would have been lost had the team left for another state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical not only for those who love sports, but the main reason I got into it was because it protected state revenues,\u201d Walker said, per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . \u201cThat just creates a big hole for everything else...This was really about protecting the taxpayers of the state.\u201d Laurel Patrick, a spokeswoman for his office, emailed that taxpayers will get $3 in income tax revenue for every dollar the state spends.\n\nBut fiscal conservatives loathe the project, and feel it undermines Walker\u2019s cost-cutting, debt-slashing, big-government-special-interest-upstanding-to bona fides. \u201cGovernment shouldn\u2019t be in the business of financing private sports stadiums,\u201d a former director of the Wisconsin chapter of the Walker-supporting and Koch Brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity told Time magazine last month .\n\nFormer Heritage Institute economist Ronald Utt told The Daily Beast he found Walker\u2019s support for the taxpayer-funded stadium \u201cbizarre\u201d and out of character for the governor. And Nick Novak, a spokesman for the Madison-based conservative MacIver Institute think tank, which typically supports Walker\u2019s policies, said the deal \u201cprobably is not a win for taxpayers,\u201d especially when you factor in interest payments that could balloon the original costs.\n\n\u201cThis is going to cost over $400 million in taxpayer investments, and they\u2019re going to see very little of that money coming back to them,\u201d he said.\n\nSo there\u2019s some debate as to whether the deal will benefit taxpayers. But there\u2019s little question as to who it will benefit: the Bucks\u2019s two owners, one of whom is an avid Hillary Clinton supporter.\n\nMarc Lasry, a co-owner of the Bucks, is no buddy of Walker\u2019s. Just months after he and another hedge fund billionaire bought the team from former Democratic Senator Herb Kohl, Lasry greeted President Obama at the airport when he arrived in Wisconsin to campaign for the governor\u2019s Democratic challenger in 2014. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , Lasry held a $40,000-per-person event at his home for the president a few months before the 2012 election, and his son is \u201ca former White House aide.\u201d\n\nLasry\u2019s political connections even made Wisconsin\u2019s Republican speaker of the house, Robin Vos, a little worried about the fate of the arena deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough sell when you're asking for millions of dollars,\u201d he said last fall.\n\nIn the end, the hard sell got sold. With Lasry, his co-owner, and Kohl pledging to pick up the other half of the estimated $500 million tab, the Bucks are just a Scott Walker signature away from a new arena that (maybe) won\u2019t look like a metal turd. But now Lasry\u2019s close relationship with Hillary could spell another round of trouble for Walker. After Clinton announced her presidential bid in April, Lasry, who has been unequivocal in his support for the likely Democratic nominee, told Bloomberg Politics that he was looking raise $270,000 for her campaign in its first week.\n\nLasry\u2019s firm, Avenue Capital Group, also gave Clinton a round-trip ride in their plane during her 2006 New York Senate reelection campaign for a mere $408, per Bloomberg . And, according to The New York Times , the firm also gave Chelsea Clinton one of her first jobs.\n\n\u201cThis is going to cost over $400 million in taxpayer investments, and they\u2019re going to see very little of that money coming back to them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just in the family. Jennifer Palmieri, Hillary for America\u2019s communications director, crashed at Lasry\u2019s Manhattan pad for a few nights as the Clinton campaign was coming together.\n\n\u201cWe have five children, so we are used to having a lot of people around, and we\u2019re happy to put up folks from the campaign,\u201d Lasry told The New York Times.\n\nGiven Walker\u2019s current standing in national polls\u2014 which thus far has largely evaded the drubbing other conservative candidates have taken from Trumpapalooza\u2014it remains to be seen if Republican primary state voters will get incensed about a massive taxpayer-funded deal from which a Clinton-loving billionaire stands to benefit.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s perhaps important to emphasize how ugly the Bucks current arena truly is. \u201cIt looks like the fucking architect realized last minute there were no fucking windows in his original design, so he decided to compensate by fucking gluing a smaller building to it that is only windows,\u201d a Reddit user called UncleStosh said, accurately, in a popular post begging Dwight Howard to play for the team.\n\n\u201cWE COULD LITERALLY PAINT A MURAL TO YOU ON 90% OF THE BUILDING,\u201d UncleStosh continued. \u201cLITERALLY.

{"entityId": 1818, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Quietly but persistently, Obama and the Democratic Party have won approval for federal judicial nominees at a rate that outdoes either of Obama\u2019s predecessors.\n\nLast month, the Senate confirmed Harvard law professor David Barron to be a federal judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit by a contested vote of 53-45. The Barron nomination received plenty of attention because of Barron\u2019s role in producing Justice Department memoranda defending the constitutionality of using drones to kill an American citizen affiliated with al Qaeda. What was lost in the coverage about the important drone issue, though, is something equally important: the Barron confirmation is the latest sign that after decades of lethargy, the Democratic Party has recently become much more passionate about\u2014and much more successful at\u2014getting their candidates confirmed to federal judgeships.\n\nFederal appellate and district courts are enormously important in our legal system. More than 99 percent of federal cases are never decided by the Supreme Court and are resolved at the final stage by these other federal courts. The conventional wisdom in Washington is that these courts might be important, but Democratic presidents cannot get their nominees confirmed to these courts.\n\nSince December 2012, when President Barack Obama started the nominations work of his second term, that narrative needs to be dramatically changed. In his first term, Obama had fewer than than four judges confirmed every month. Since December 2012, that rate approaches five judges a month, an increase of nearly 30 percent. During the similar period in his second term, President Bill Clinton saw a roughly 25 percent drop in the number of his nominees successfully confirmed.\n\nOver the course of his entire presidency, Obama has succeeded in having more federal judges confirmed than did President George W. Bush, who put a lot of work into transforming the federal courts. When President Bush left office, ten of the 13 federal appellate courts had a majority of judges nominated by Republican presidents, two had an equal ratio of Republican and Democratic nominees, and one had a majority of judges nominated by Democratic presidents. Now, nine have a majority of judges nominated by Democratic presidents, while four have a majority of judges nominated by Republican presidents.\n\nAs I have written elsewhere, who these judges are can matter just as much\u2014if not more\u2014than how many of them there are. Obama\u2019s record on nominating a diverse bench is historically unprecedented. Consider, for instance, that 42 percent of his nominees are women, compared to 22 percent for the second President Bush and 29 percent for President Clinton. Eight percent of his nominees are Asian-Americans and Pacific-Islanders, and the best any president could do before that was 1 percent.\n\nSecond presidential terms are about policies, but they are also about legacies.\n\n\n\nAppointing younger judges also has important ramifications. Younger judges can exert their influence for decades, and can even be candidates for later Supreme Court vacancies. During his first term, particularly in his first few nominations, Obama almost exclusively nominated older judges. Since his re-election, the average age of his confirmed nominees has fallen by several years. Michelle Friedland, confirmed in April to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the Western United States, is currently the youngest federal appellate court judge on any court in the country.\n\nFederal judges might all have one vote, but their influence can vary widely. Some of the best judges might write judicial opinions so compelling that other judges rely on them and all lawyers and law students feel like they should read them. Judges can exert influence by using their professional networks to hire the best law students as law clerks and then propel those law clerks to later professional success in the legal and political arenas.\n\nThe judges that Obama has had confirmed in the past 18 months can rival the quality of judges confirmed during any 18 month period in the recent past. Barron will be exceptionally important, which is another reason why Republican senators tried to block his confirmation. Friedland will be equally important. And several of Obama\u2019s confirmed judges for the district courts, from Christopher Cooper in the District of Columbia to Jesse Furman and Allison Nathan in New York City, will also be superstars.\n\nJust as important as the quantity and quality of the judges that Obama has had confirmed is what these confirmations represent: stakeholders in the Democratic Party who are willing to push aggressively to have their judges confirmed.\n\nFor decades, judicial confirmations were seen as a Republican issue. In the Supreme Court, Republicans lost many cases dear to their hearts in the last half of the 20th century, cases like Roe v. Wade. Their jurisprudential superstar, Robert Bork, was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan, and rejected by a Democratic Senate. The sting of losing in the courts mobilized Republicans to create an infrastructure that worked on judicial nominations (such as the Federalist Society). Because of all of this, every Republican candidate for president has to deliver impassioned speeches about the federal courts.\n\nBy contrast, with the comfort of many victories in the courts over many years, Democratic presidents have historically not cared as much about these issues. President Jimmy Carter and President Clinton left a minimal imprint on the federal courts, and after his first few years many thought the same would be true of Obama.\n\nBut the recent uptick in the quality and quantity of confirmed federal judges is just one indication that the Democratic Party might care more about judicial nominations more\u2014and care more effectively\u2014than it has in a long time. The president appeared last year with several of his nominees in the Rose Garden, a strong sign that the White House cared about judicial nominations. And in the Senate, following Republican efforts to block Obama nominees, Democrats led the effort to change the filibuster rule to ease the process of confirming Obama\u2019s nominees\u2014particularly judicial nominees.\n\nThe interest groups affiliated with the Democratic Party have also shown they can exercise some muscle when it comes to actual or potential nominees who do not satisfy them. For many years, frustrated Democrats highlighted the example of Harriet Miers\u2014the second President Bush\u2019s failed nominee to the Supreme Court\u2014as an example of what they wish could happen on the political left, but never did. Bush withdrew the Miers nomination when it became clear that conservative interest groups and senators did not support her, even though a president of their party had nominated her. By contrast, it would have been hard to do that with a Supreme Court nominee offered by a Democratic president. Interest groups would have had a hard time convincing a Democratic White House to withdraw a nominee. But that could change. Currently interest groups on the left are strongly resisting a nominee for a federal district court seat in Georgia based on their opposition to positions the nominee held while serving the Georgia state legislature, and Senator Al Franken has announced he will vote against the nominee. Another potential Obama nominee in Pennsylvania was never put forward because of interest group opposition.\n\nSecond presidential terms are about policies, but they are also about legacies. The judges that Obama has had confirmed in the past 18 months will be a central part of his legacy, as will the new politics of judicial confirmations that these judges represent. We could be entering a brave new era, an era when both parties care passionately about who wears the robes on our federal courts.\n\nDavid Fontana is an associate professor of law at George Washington University School of Law.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:39.785+0000"}

That's going to happen to blacks and youth the senator hopes to court.\n\nRand Paul believes he can win the White House by attracting new voters to the Republican Party, but Bill Maher demonstrates why this is a fantasy.\n\nThe libertarian-leaning Republican is basing his likely presidential candidacy in large part on his ability to reach out to voters who don't traditionally cast their ballot for the GOP.\n\n\u201cRand is positioned to be the conservative who can build a bigger, more inclusive Republican Party so we can win in 2016,\u201d one of his advisers recently told Politico.\n\nPaul's support for reforming America's drug laws and his staunch opposition to government surveillance will inspire young voters and African Americans to vote for him, the argument goes, while Paul's non-interventionist foreign policy will sell his candidacy to liberals who oppose President Obama's continuation of George W. Bush's war on terror.\n\nTo demonstrate the appeal of his message to young Americans, Paul traveled to the liberal hotbed of Berkeley, California earlier this year to speak to students at the University of California. According to reports, he received several standing ovations by railing against the government's surveillance programs. Last week he met with black leaders in Ferguson, Missouri two months after he called for the police there and across the country to be demilitarized.\n\nBut the reality is that Paul won't to be able to get Woodstock-sized loads of liberal Berkeley students into his coalition, in the unlikely event he actually wins the GOP nomination. While they may be attracted to his tirades against government spying, they are likely to be turned off by other aspects of his record.\n\nJust look at comedian Bill Maher's short-lived flirtation with Paul. Maher isn\u2019t a college liberal, but he is the type of left-winger Paul hopes to win over. Indeed, Maher even said he would consider voting for Paul if the 2016 presidential race came down to one between Hillary Clinton and the senator.\n\nThe reality is that Paul won't to be able to get Woodstock-sized loads of liberal Berkeley students into his coalition.\n\nBut in an interview with Salon published last week, Maher said he recently had drinks with Paul and that while he likes Paul\u2019s foreign policy instincts, he now doesn't think he could vote for Paul because of his views on environmental issues.\n\n\u201cWell, his answer on the environment was wholly unsatisfactory to me,\u201d Maher said about the meeting. \u201cSo, right on that issue, he would lose my vote.\u201d\n\nAnd so it will be with the other constituencies Paul supposedly appeals to on an issue or two.\n\nWhile some outside the Republican tent on may cheer Paul's steps to ramp down the war on drugs, many of those very people will be turned off by Paul's vision for pairing down government spending.\n\nTake those young Berkeley liberals. They like Paul\u2019s stance on civil liberties, but how do you think they will react when they, like Maher, learn about Paul\u2019s stance on environmental issues, like global warming? Or, better yet, how do you think they will respond to the inevitable Democratic attack ad tying Paul's father\u2019s bigoted newsletters to Paul's philosophical musings opposing part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to his hiring of a top staffer who famously wore a Confederate flag mas and celebrated the assassin of Abraham Lincoln in his past life as a radio shock jock?\n\nI don't for a minute think Paul is racist. There is no reason he should be held liable for his father's newsletters and Paul's comments on the Civil Rights Act on MSNBC when he was an unpolished Senate candidate were philosophically consistent with a libertarian view of what the government should and should not be involved in. But politics is a tough business. It doesn't do nuance very well. These data points, along with his hiring of the \"Southern Avenger,\" will help Democrats make Paul toxic to the very constituencies Paul has been nobly trying to bring into the Republican tent, such as young voters and African Americans.\n\nPaul deserves a lot of credit for pushing the GOP in the right direction on issues like drug reform and for reaching out to minority communities too often ignored by the GOP.

{"entityId": 1820, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "With a Republican victory in the Senate looking increasingly likely, the President\u2019s ability to appoint federal judges is about to be curtailed. And that matters a lot.\n\nAs we approach Election Day, you might wonder why everyone is fussing so much over whether the Democrats or the Republicans will control the Senate for the next two years. After all, with the Democrats in control of the White House and the Republicans in control of the House of Representatives, why does it matter who controls the Senate?\n\nEven if the Republicans control both the House and the Senate, they can\u2019t enact any laws without the President\u2019s approval, and even if the Democrats control both the Senate and the White House, they can\u2019t enact any laws without the approval of the House. In short, no matter who wins the Senate, we have gridlock.\n\nThere is at least one respect in which control of the Senate is truly critical, though. This concerns judicial appointments.\n\nBecause a majority of senators can block a nomination, control of the Senate becomes critical. If the Democrats retain their majority, they can continue to confirm President Obama\u2019s nominees. If the Republicans gain control of the Senate, however, they will be able to block his nominees\u2014and there is little doubt that they will do so with a vengeance.\n\nMost people pay attention to this only in regards the Supreme Court, but the lower courts are also critically important.\n\nSince taking office, Obama has had approximately 280 federal judicial nominees confirmed. This represents roughly one-third of the federal judiciary. This has had a profound impact on our legal system in at least two very important respects.\n\nFirst, Obama\u2019s appointments have added substantial diversity to the federal bench. Forty-two percent of Obama\u2019s judicial appointments have been women, as compared to only 22 percent of President George W. Bush\u2019s nominees. Thirty-six percent of Obama\u2019s judicial appointments have been minorities, as compared to only 18 percent of Bush\u2019s judicial appointees.\n\nThe nation must care deeply about a president\u2019s federal judicial appointments, because they will shape the meaning of federal law for decades to come.\n\nSecond, although Obama has generally been much less ideological in his judicial nominations than Bush, there is no doubt he has appointed much more liberal judges than his predecessor, and the addition of almost 280 Obama-appointed judges has had a dramatic effect on the overall ideological disposition of the federal judiciary.\n\nIndeed, for the first time in more than a decade, judges appointed by Democratic presidents now substantially outnumber judges appointed by Republican presidents. These judges now hold a majority of seats of nine of the 13 United States Courts of Appeals. In 2008, Republican-appointed judges held a majority on 12 of the 13 Courts of Appeals. The shift is dramatic, and it is important.\n\nAcross a broad range of issues, such as the rights of persons accused of crime, abortion, the environment, immigration, affirmative action, gun control, religious liberty, campaign finance, women\u2019s rights, the rights of corporations, and the right to vote, judges appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents tend to take very different positions.\n\nThus, who controls the Senate will determine the fate of as many as 90 federal judicial appointments that are likely to arise in the final two years of Obama\u2019s presidency. If the Democrats control the Senate, the Republicans, no longer able to invoke the filibuster, will have only limited ability to block the President\u2019s nominees. If the Republicans control the Senate, you can be sure that many fewer Obama nominees will be confirmed, and that those who do win confirmation will be much less progressive than the judges this White House has managed to appoint in its first six years. This will have a lasting and important impact on the federal judiciary for decades to come.\n\nAs President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Attorney General Edwin Meese once observed, the nation must care deeply about a president\u2019s federal judicial appointments, because they will shape the meaning of federal law for decades to come, \u201cno matter what happens in future presidential elections.\u201d\n\nDoes it matter who wins the Senate?

It\u2019s the animal that gave us the cowboy\u2014symbol of the American spirit. And, of course, their meat and milk make up a prodigious portion of our diet.\n\nThe cow\u2019s outsized role is the subject of a new book, Cowed: The Hidden Impact of 93 Million Cows on America\u2019s Health, Economy, Politics, Culture, and Environment by Denis Hayes, the coordinator of the first Earth Day and a former Carter administration official, and his wife, Gail Boyer Hayes.\n\n\n\nThe books covers much of the ground tread in its acclaimed predecessors such as Christopher Leonard\u2019s The Meat Racket, Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s Eating Animals, and Michael Pollan\u2019s The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma, and his documentary, Food, Inc.\n\nThe Hayes\u2019s book talks about the horrors of the meat industry and what they mean for the planet (the production of methane, for instance), for humans (the industry pollutes by dumping bovine waste in water), for the economy (corn subsidies), and the cows themselves (when the stunning of a cow for slaughter \u201cis flubbed, the poor creature may be skinned and disassembled while still alive and conscious\u201d). The purpose of the book, the authors write, is to get people to eat less meat, as that\u2019s the only practical solution to the challenges raised.\n\n\n\nWhat is fascinating about the book is that it is emblematic of an environmental movement that has largely found itself stuck in the American political sphere.\n\nBut none of this is new to anybody who has come across this issue even tangentially.\n\nInstead, what is fascinating about the book is that it is emblematic of an environmental movement that has largely found itself stuck in the American political sphere. Half the electorate and two branches of government are unsympathetic if not outright hostile, and the party that it supports (Democrats) often takes it for granted.\n\n\n\nThings have gotten so bad that the most interesting issue talked about politically when it comes to environmentalists is what they can learn from the uber successful gay rights movement.\n\nAs the authors note throughout the book, they face opposition from conservatives on a lot of core issues. Yet when it comes to the nitty-gritty of political maneuvering, and how the environmental movement could make headway there, the authors seem to be living in an alternate reality. The 300-odd-page book is essentially a giant preaching to the choir.\n\nThere is, for instance, the part where the authors write, \u201cIf Congress ever places a price on carbon, as would be required by Senator Maria Cantwell\u2019s CLEAR Act, market forces would make cow power economical without voluntary subsidies.\u201d Even left-wing Think Progress labeled this idea \u201cneither politically nor environmentally viable.\u201d Or there\u2019s the part when they lament that Representative Louise Slaughter\u2019s proposed Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act \u201chas been endorsed by 368 worthy organizations but by none of her Republican colleagues.\u201d How is this shocking? Furthermore, how will a book catering only to people who care about those organizations move the dial?\n\nThe message is diluted by a lot of rants, akin to that well-meaning aunt or uncle who watched Current TV and just can\u2019t stay on the topic at hand. (Essentially the left\u2019s version of John Slattery\u2019s character on 30 Rock). It might get a lot of amens from the authors\u2019s friends, but it\u2019s unlikely to sway libertarians who might be sympathetic to their priorities on corn. Instead, the authors pop off about whether or not corporations are people. Or whether or not milk \u201cis an ideal transmitting agent for biological terrorism.\u201d Or debating the minutiae on raw milk, perennials, and till farming. None of these screeds really contribute to the end goal, which is convincing people to eat less meat.\n\nAlso, if we want something to appeal to the mainstream, how about we don\u2019t even bring up Malthus? \u201cAmmonium nitrate fertilizer revolutionized agriculture, winning a temporary respite in Malthus\u2019s race between human population growth and food limits,\u201d the Hayeses write. \u201cThe world\u2019s population today might be a third smaller but for the extra food made possible by this fertilizer.\u201d Paging the academy.\n\n\n\nThen there is the bizarre propaganda aspect of Cowed. Hedge-fund billionaire and Democratic mega-donor Tom Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor, have an ode written to them in the book. The Hayes couple describes these underwriters of the environmental movement as \u201chardworking perfectionists who aren\u2019t easily intimidated\u201d and then ends the section with what can only be read as an advertisement for the billionaire\u2019s farm\u2019s product: \u201cLeftCoast GrassFed Beef is 100 percent grass-fed and grass-finished. The cows are given no hormones or antibiotics.\u201d And so on.\n\nAll of this is unfortunate, because the Hayes couple both have led praise-worthy careers and are fighting for a just cause\u2014to keep our planet healthy. But their book is just another reminder of how far the environmentalist movement has to go until their methods get the kind of traction necessary to foment actual action, and not just by the executive branch.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:40.754+0000"}
{"entityId": 1822, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "We have been conditioned to believe that the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision ceded control of American politics to the rich. But is that really so?\n\nOne day I want to write a dystopian political novel set in the not-too-distant future. The novel\u2019s premise would be that America has become a country where nothing works, or is made, or runs on its own. The only remaining economic engine is electioneering\u2014the so-called \u201cendless campaign\u201d will have become truly endless. With the rest of the economy off-shored or robot-ized, politics will have become a vampire squid like Wall Street or Silicon Valley. Karl Rove and David Axelrod will be figures of Gatesian wealth, and stale pizza the latest artisanal food craze.\n\nBut, as is so often the case, fantasy is soon to be outstripped by events. Or so it seems to me after reading Big Money, Politico reporter Kenneth P. Vogel\u2019s lively take on the world of campaign finance in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United ruling that ripped away whatever minimal constraints there were to prevent a full-scale takeover of politics by the 1 percent of the 1 percent.\n\nThe political super-rich are not just different from you or me. They are even different from the merely rich who can spare, say, $1,000 for a favored candidate or cause (a sum so miniscule, Vogel makes clear, as to be hardly worth the postage necessary to solicit it). They have much, much more money, and they apparently have the muscle to keep you away from their parties, as Vogel finds out in some of the book\u2019s most entertaining set pieces.\n\nThere is the Koch Brothers soiree at the Renaissance Esmeralda Resort in the California desert, which, after Vogel is 86\u2019d, he receives a suspicious phone call at his hotel and finds out that his rental car is reported stolen. There is the Democracy Alliance\u2014a mostly secretive group of big money progressive donors\u2014party at the D.C. Mandarin, where Vogel is ushered out by an off-duty cop and an Alliance spokeswoman who insists to Vogel that anyone he happened to spot there was strictly off-the-record (a stipulation that Vogel quite amusingly ignores.)\n\nBut who are these people? They are not, our suspicions to the contrary notwithstanding, much interested in bending elections their way in order to pad their wallets (megadonors are almost exclusively male). Hiring a few high priced lobbyists is a much cheaper and more effective way to convince regulators to look the other way. Rather, they are political junkies. Whether it\u2019s the Koch Brothers\u2019 Americans for Prosperity, or the liberal Democracy Alliance, or Karl Rove\u2019s Crossroads GPS, the major organizations treat their contributors like hedge fund clients, complete with glossy briefing books and power point presentations about the latest polling data or TV ad buy. It\u2019s fantasy camp for wanna-be political operatives, and with not much more of a buy-in than Sotheby\u2019s requires. The difference, of course, is that with auction houses or expensive wines, you more or less get what you pay for.\n\nDemocratic donors yearn for the return of the Clintons, who at least know how to make multi-millionaires feel special.\n\nVogel spins a story of a political culture becoming slowly unbound by previous constraints like party loyalty or seniority. Instead, after Citizens United, the mega donors set up their own shadow parties. They make their own ads, run their own canvassing efforts, and have even started recruiting their own candidates. The results, needless to say, have been mixed, often laughable, rarely dangerous\u2014think of that clown car GOP primary season in the last presidential election. One week at the New York Yankees fantasy camp does not mean you can stand in against Roger Clemens.\n\nAn odd side note to all of this is how much better at it Democrats have been than Republicans. The conservative ranks are so flush with outsiders and fringe groups that they end up tripping over one another. Part of the reason for this, Vogel suggests, is that Republicans have never much cared for campaign finance issues, and so are much more comfortable simply throwing their money at the Super PAC wall to see what sticks.\n\nDemocrats, by contrast, are still sheepish about playing the big money game, and when they do pony up, they do so with a sigh, mumbling some half-baked metaphor about not fighting with one hand tied behind their back or some such. One is even tempted to admire President Obama, who Vogel calls a hypocrite for decrying the proliferation of big money in politics even as he raises gargantuan sums himself. But at least Obama does seem to genuinely loathe the sucking up required to grease the wheels. Meanwhile, according to Vogel, Democratic donors yearn for the return of the Clintons, who at least know how to make multi-millionaires feel special.\n\nBig Money is a good guide to the players and places in all this, but ultimately Vogel left me hungry. As he tells it, this is a story without much context and with very little past. Reading Big Money, you might get the idea that campaign contributions began with George Soros or the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. How were political campaigns funded in the \u201960s, let alone during the Gilded Age? I don\u2019t know, and I didn\u2019t learn it here.\n\nBut the biggest question left unexplored is what all of this dough accomplishes. Vogel details some of the quick fortunes top campaign aides have made in this era of big money, but he doesn\u2019t really explain how the bucks corrupt the political process. If the mega-donors aren\u2019t funding political campaigns in the hopes of seeing some kind of payback, what do they want? Why do they bother? And is politics really cleaner when stringent restrictions are put into place?\n\nVogel\u2019s book focuses on the post-Citizens United landscape, and the implication is that things changed drastically in the wake of that court decision. But really, what changed? that court decision really changed norms more than it changed the rules. There is very little campaign finance that happens now that could not have happened back in 2008, it just didn\u2019t, mainly out of fear by the donor class of running afoul of vague rules and laws. Money infused the political bloodstream long before 2010, and conservatives who howl that they have every right to buy TV ads so long as left leaning outlets like The New York Times get to endorse candidates have a point. Distasteful those ads might be, but restrictions on political speech should be exercised with great deliberation and caution.\n\nIn the end though, big money doesn\u2019t seem to matter that much. The cash that the Kochs or the Democratic duo of Steve and Amber Mostyn give to politicians is of little concern to the donors and lets a few old political hands in Washington buy bigger houses. But the real takeaway is that all this cash apparently has little influence on who wins or loses elections. In a TiVo age, who watches political ads anyway, no matter how specious or bombastic? The Kochtapus takeover is an alarming image, and one Democrats have used with great effectiveness to separate their own partisans from their money, but it still was not enough to even unseat a mildly unpopular president in a bad economic year.\n\nThe endless fundraising becomes like an itch that the more the money class scratches, the more they need to. Just a few thousand here, and a few more there, for this devastating TV ad or that new Get Out the Vote Effort, and our takeover will be at last complete. And the whole huge machinery of it all\u2014the consultants and ad makers and eye buyers and pollsters and the men and women in little black coats catering the fundraiser\u2014grows ever larger, its endless appetite never sated. Try bringing that up at the next confab at the Renaissance Esmeralda, if you really want to be shown the door.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:41.041+0000"}

But even the dovish side of the GOP now acknowledges the election was a win for their party\u2019s hawks.\n\nThe Republican victory in the 2014 midterms is less than 24 hours old. But already, the hawkish wing of the GOP is planning an ambitious battle plan to revamp American foreign policy: everything from arming Ukraine\u2019s military to reviewing the ISIS war to investigating the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s role in warming relations with Iran.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday, Sen. John McCain, the incoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he has already discussed a new national-security agenda with fellow Republicans Bob Corker and Richard Burr, the likely incoming chairmen of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\n\u201cBurr and Corker and I will be working closely together on everything,\u201d McCain said. \u201cFor example, arms for Ukraine\u2019s [government], examination of our strategy in the Middle East, our assets with regard to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin in the region, China\u2019s continued encroachment in the South China Sea.\u201d\n\nYou could call it the neoconservatives\u2019 revenge or the year of the hawks. But it has produced an interesting moment in Washington, where even the dovish side of the Republican Party now acknowledges the midterms were a win for their party\u2019s American exceptionalists.\n\nAs Ron Paul, the isolationist father of Sen. Rand Paul, tweeted Tuesday evening: \u201cRepublican control of the Senate = expanded neocon wars in Syria and Iraq. Boots on the ground are coming!\u201d William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, was in rare agreement with the elder Paul. \u201cI think Ron Paul told the truth,\u201d Kristol told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnd the truth is that his son had a bad election season and the Republicans who were elected are various species of hawks and not Rand Paul-like doves.\u201d\n\nThose hawks include some new faces in the Senate like Tom Cotton, the Republican from Arkansas whose campaign was boosted in its final month with ad buys from Kristol\u2019s Emergency Committee for Israel.\n\nOther hawks like McCain have been around for years, but are now back in control of the powerful committees that exercise oversight of the Executive Branch\u2019s foreign policy and war fighting.\n\nMcCain said his first order of business as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee will be to end the budget rule known as sequestration, which requires the U.S. military to cut its budget across the board. \u201cI want to start an examination of our policies in the world and then find out whether we have the capability to meet these expectations,\u201d McCain said. McCain also said he would use his chairmanship to root out overspending at the Pentagon, but he emphasized his desire to reverse sequestration.\n\n\u201cThere is going to be real scrutiny from the House and Senate in what\u2019s taken place on the entire Obama administration\u2019s tenure dealing with the Iranians.\u201d\n\nAnother major issue for the new Republicans will be a potential Iran deal. President Obama was circumspect Wednesday at a press conference on the current nuclear negotiations between Iran and six major powers that are set to expire in November.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes, the Republican likely to replace Rep. Mike Rogers as the next chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told The Daily Beast Wednesday that he would like to begin digging into the administration\u2019s Iran talks\u2014in particular, the role played in those talks by the U.S. intelligence community.\n\n\u201cThere is going to be real scrutiny from the House and Senate in what\u2019s taken place on the entire Obama administration\u2019s tenure dealing with the Iranians,\u201d Nunes said. Nunes said he was interested in following up on why U.S. intelligence officials who briefed his committee did not acknowledge their role in negotiations with Iran when asked by the committee\u2019s chairman, Mike Rogers, earlier this year.\n\nNunes would not get much more specific. The Republicans will not likely choose committee chairmen in the House until next week. But the interest of Nunes, who is currently a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in the role of U.S. spies in Iran talks is significant.\n\nFor years the CIA and the State Department have relied on interlocutors as channels to Iran\u2019s powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps. In 2007, 2008, and 2009, the U.S. intelligence community participated in talks led by the U.S. embassy in Baghdad with representatives of Qassem Suleimani, the commander of Iran\u2019s Quds Force and the man reported to be helping lead Iraq\u2019s ground campaign against ISIS.\n\nTo date, much of the details of the diplomacy and even the interim deal between Iran and the West are shrouded in secrecy. Before November 2013, when the current talks were announced, the State Department and the White House kept from the press the private discussions with Iranian counterparts taking place in Oman.\n\nGary Samore, who served as the White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction in Obama\u2019s first term, said the Oman discussions were kept quiet at the request of the Iranians. \u201cWe were happy to have this be an open meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cMeaning that it would be public knowledge that it would take place. The Iranians insisted on secrecy, for them the sensitivity about meeting bilaterally with Americans is very acute.\u201d\n\nIf Nunes pushes further on the details and extent of the Iran talks as chairman of the House intelligence panel, he will be taking a very different tack from some of his colleagues.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats this year tried to pass new sanctions on Iran aimed at taking effect after talks expire if Iran does not dismantle its nuclear program. The White House was able to kill the sanctions bill this year and persuade key Senate Democrats like Sen. Robert Menendez, the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to hold off on pushing for a vote.\n\nRecent reports say the United States would be willing to allow Iran to keep thousands of its centrifuges in place, if the machines were disconnected and incapable of producing a cascade of enriched nuclear fuel.\n\nNunes said he thinks the deal being contemplated could lead to disaster.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t the Congress be concerned about the Iranians getting a nuclear weapon,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are going to be close to getting a nuclear weapon because of this deal, this should matter to the American people.\u201d\n\nMcCain said he, Corker, and Burr are also interested in pursuing more vigorous oversight of the Iran deal as well. \u201cThe Iranians are helping [Syrian dictator] Bashar Assad,\u201d McCain added. \u201cThey are the ones that got the 5,000 Hezbollah guys into the fight [against Syria\u2019s rebels], they are gaining more and more influence in Baghdad. And we somehow believe we make a nuclear deal with them and that will lead to other areas of cooperation.\u201d\n\nOne silver lining for Obama may be on the issue of a new congressional authorization for war against ISIS. Earlier this year, when Obama began bombing targets in Syria, his administration said the legal authority for the new war stemmed from the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) that specifically targeted the people, groups, and states responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Many legal scholars found the rationale for the war specious because while ISIS was at one point a franchise of al Qaeda, it has for nearly a year been in open warfare with al Qaeda\u2019s franchise in Syria.\n\nOn Wednesday Obama said he would ask Congress to vote on the new war against ISIS during the lame-duck session of Congress that starts in December.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time for an AUMF, I do,\u201d McCain said. \u201cThe one passed after 9/11 specifically talks about the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks and ISIS has exceeded that definition.\u201d", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:41.342+0000"}

The presence of obscure spoiler Thomas Carey who grabbed 1.6% of the vote in this razor-tight primary was just enough to force Magnolia State Republicans to head to the polls all over again on June 24.\n\nThe Senate race was one of the dirtiest, grimiest, strangest campaigns in recent political history. The low point came when a blogger named Clayton Kelly broke into the nursing home of Cochran\u2019s wife, Rose, who suffers from severe dementia and is bedridden, in an attempt to somehow aid McDaniel.\n\nWhile the McDaniel campaign has disclaimed any connection to the break-in, three other men have since been arrested for helping Kelly, including Mark Mayfield, a McDaniel volunteer and prominent Tea Party activist, and John Mary, who co-hosted a radio show with McDaniel. The logic apparently was to somehow aid McDaniel by helping push a story that 76-year-old Cochran was having an affair with a longtime aide from whom he rented an apartment in Washington. While rumors of septuagenarian senators having affairs with staff members are not unusual, this is believed to be the first time that the staff member who was the subject of gossip was older than the senator involved.\n\nRegardless of the political aims of Kelly\u2019s strategy, it boomeranged on McDaniel. His campaign was thrown on the defensive as the race escalated from what was already a ferociously aggressive campaign into one that was increasingly bizarre. By the end, McDaniel\u2019s campaign was going out of its way to keep reporters from events while Cochran, fighting his first serious campaign since the Carter administration, struggled on the stump. SuperPACs from both sides spent millions on the race as Mississippi\u2019s airwaves were jam-packed with political ads.\n\nThe result of this fiercely contested race was a higher turnout than anticipated. It approached 300,000, far higher than the 250,000 figure bandied by the Cochran campaign as the minimum that they needed to have a chance. While the map looked much as pundits predicted\u2014-with Cochran winning in the Mississippi Delta and the state capital, Jackson, while McDaniel racked up huge margins in his native turf in southeast Mississippi\u2019s Pinebelt (including a huge surge in turnout in his native Jones County, where he won 85% of the vote)\u2014-there were surprises. Cochran\u2019s vote collapsed in the Memphis suburbs of DeSoto County, while he managed to do better than expected in northeast Mississippi. The one ace in the hole for the incumbent senator was the intervention of Democrats who crossed over to vote for him in the state\u2019s open primary. Turnout in Lafayette County, home of the University of Mississippi and a liberal bastion by the Magnolia State\u2019s standards, was 50% higher than in the state\u2019s 2011 gubernatorial primary.\n\nOn election night, Cochran didn\u2019t address the crowd although his campaign gamely spun the result as an act of remarkable survival against the out-of-state groups who had spent $5 million to take him down. In contrast, McDaniel addressed a jubilant crowd at a campaign rally in Hattiesburg, proclaiming \u201cThis is a historic moment in this state\u2019s history\u201d and predicting that \u201cwhether it\u2019s tomorrow or whether it is three weeks from tonight we will stand victorious in this race.\u201d\n\nThe Tea Party state senator then darkly warned, \u201cIn the long history of the world, only a handful of generations have ever had the chance and granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum peril. Your responsibilities are intense. We must not stop fighting. This government is worth your defense. This Constitution worth your restoration.\u201d After wrapping his remarks and bringing his family on to the stage, McDaniel returned to the microphone to remind the crowd, \u201cWe owe everything that happened tonight to Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, he is in control.\u201d\n\nBoth campaigns are worn out from their all-out battle. Their war chests are empty.\n\nWith no knowledge of the divine will, however, it is always difficult to predict the outcome of a runoff. U.S. senators from Mississippi have traditionally enjoyed greater job security than hereditary monarchs and Cochran is only the third person to be elected for a full term in his Senate seat since the passage of the 17th Amendment. Both campaigns are worn out from their all-out battle. Their war chests are empty, their volunteers and staff are exhausted. With a runoff likely to have lower turnout than the primary (with anyone who voted in the Democratic primary prohibited from participating), the electorate is likely to be more conservative than Tuesday\u2019s. But the runoff won\u2019t be the last competitive election for the Senate seat this year.\n\nWhile Mississippi looms in the popular imagination as a Republican stronghold, the state\u2019s congressional delegation was majority Democratic as recently as 2010 and the GOP only took full control of the state legislature in 2011. The state is also one where Obama won 44% of the vote in 2012 buoyed by high African-American turnout.\n\nThe Democratic nominee who will face the eventual runoff winner is former Rep. Travis Childers. He won a conservative district in a 2007 special election and managed to hold on in 2008 before going down in the GOP wave of 2010. If McDaniel wins the nomination, Childers would be well positioned to harness the votes of disaffected establishment Republicans and traditional conservative Democrats. A Democrat running statewide only needs about 25%-30% of the white vote in the Magnolia State and Childers, a credible pro-life, pro-guns candidate, epitomizes the type of Democrat who wins at a local level in the state. He also may find unexpected support from inside the Beltway. After all, a Democratic pickup in Mississippi would mark the third consecutive cycle that a Tea Party primary caused the GOP to squander an otherwise safe Senate seat and it would only strengthen the establishment case in the ongoing internecine conflict within the Republican Party. But even the most optimistic advocate for Childers still only sees him having a 50/50 chance against McDaniel. In contrast, if Cochran wins the runoff, it\u2019s debatable whether Childers will even take the time to march in parades this summer. In the meantime, before the runoff, it\u2019s likely that the Democratic candidate, who has barely raised money and has a barebones website, will start gearing up his campaign apparatus.\n\nDespite the looming specter of Childers, McDaniel still has a significant edge in the runoff. Incumbents forced into runoffs rarely fare well in any situation, let alone after serving six terms with minimal intraparty opposition. But, in a campaign defined by a blogger breaking into a nursing home, stranger things have happened.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:41.599+0000"}

At Commentary, Noah Rothman wrote that the billionaire\u2019s proposal could mark the GOP \u201cwith the stain of Trumpist nativism.\u201d At Reason, Nick Gillespie made a libertarian critique, charging Trump\u2019s proposal would grow the surveillance state. And at the New York Post, Republican strategist Liz Mair argued that Trump\u2019s pro-mass-deportation stance was not only bad policy, but also bad politics in the Republican presidential primary.\n\nBut as quickly as Trump\u2019s detractors materialized, so did his defenders, which included groups that have been dubbed as nativist and, in some cases, flagged by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League as out-and-out hateful.\n\nIn particular, three groups that sang Donald\u2019s praise\u2014the Center for Immigration Studies, the Foundation for American Immigration Reform, and NumbersUSA\u2014have ideological roots in a population control movement that many find detestable.\n\nMark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies told Breitbart that besides Rick Santorum, no other candidate \u201chas as sound and as well thought-through an immigration plan.\u201d FAIR spokesperson Ira Mehlman praised the plan to CNN, saying it \u201cprovides meaningful penalties for those who are not deterred [from violating the law].\u201d And NumbersUSA president Roy Beck praised Trump for questioning the value of high legal immigration levels.\n\n\u201cThey want to reduce the size of the U.S. population, and they see immigration as the key to doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important outcome of Trump's plans may be pressure for all candidates\u2014including Trump\u2014to be asked what level of legal immigration they support,\u201d he wrote on the group\u2019s site.\n\nAs The New York Times reported in 2011, all three groups share a founding father, John Tanton. Tanton, a Michigan ophthalmologist, worked to stop population growth, and looked to build a cross-ideological coalition that would bring together law-and-order right-wingers and C0 2 -conscious environmentalists to fight the overpopulation of the United States.\n\nBut the groups faced a tough PR problem when news emerged that FAIR had taken money from a racist group. And the paper notes that Tanton was a booster of the work of white supremacist Jared Taylor and supported eugenics.\n\n\u201cDo we leave it to individuals to decide that they are the intelligent ones who should have more kids?\u201d he once wrote, per the Times. \u201cAnd more troublesome, what about the less intelligent, who logically should have less. Who is going to break the bad news to them?\u201d\n\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, Tanton also started a group called the Society for Genetic Education and mourned that Hitler gave eugenics a bad name. The ADL said these ties give politicians cause to distance themselves from the groups Tanton helped start.\n\n\u201cA close examination of the history of the movement reveals another reason for politicians to distance themselves: key members of the anti-immigrant movement have promoted eugenics\u2013the practice of selective breeding with the aim of \u2018race betterment,\u2019 a policy practiced by the Nazis,\u201d reads a post on ADL\u2019s site.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center says the three Tanton-started groups are at \u201cthe nexus of the American nativist movement.\u201d It designated FAIR as a hate group because of \u201cits acceptance of $1.2 million from the Pioneer Fund, a group founded to promote the genes of white colonials that funds studies of race, intelligence and genetics. FAIR has also hired as key officials men who also joined white supremacist groups. It has board members who regularly write for hate publications. It promotes racist conspiracy theories about Latinos. And it has produced television programming featuring white nationalists.\u201d\n\nAll three groups have offered praise for Trump\u2019s immigration proposal, which calls for mandatory deportation of criminal undocumented immigrants and the tougher requirements for legal immigration. And some on the right say this should give conservatives pause.\n\n\u201cWhy are conservatives listening to groups who actively promote the idea that the U.S. is overpopulated, that we can\u2019t have more people in the U.S. because it causes environmental harm, that they contribute to global warming?\u201d said Alfonso Aguilar, the director of American Principles in Action\u2019s Latino Partnership, and former head of the U.S. Office of Citizenship under George W. Bush.\n\nAnd Linda Chavez\u2014president of the Becoming American Institute and chairman of the National Commission on Migrant Education under President George H.W. Bush\u2014said she wasn\u2019t surprised the groups favor Trump\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cThese groups are radical population control groups,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to reduce the size of the U.S. population, and they see immigration as the key to doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think many conservatives are simply ignorant of the groups\u2019 ties, ignorant of their history,\u201d she added.\n\nThe groups defend themselves, and charge that Aguilar and Chavez\u2019s criticisms amount to little more than guilt by association.\n\n\u201cPersonally, myself, I think the guy\u2019s something of a circus clown,\u201d Krikorian said of Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a bloviating megalomaniac. Nevertheless, no one else has offered as concrete and sound an immigration proposal as Trump has, so you\u2019ve gotta give credit where credit is due.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really is a sign of how bankrupt the supporters of mass immigration are that this is all they\u2019ve got,\u201d he added. \u201cLinda and Alfonso and the rest of them are Alinskyite conservatives.\u201d\n\nRoy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, made a similar defense.\n\n\u201cAlfonso Aguilar and other activists who are unwilling to set any limits on the number of immigrants that enter the U.S. hurl insults as a substitute for debate,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cNumbersUSA is a nonpartisan organization that favors an immigration policy that includes spouses, minor children, fair share of refugees, people with extraordinary skills and gives preferential treatment to American workers and those that come here legally. Mr. Aguilar resorts to false accusations because this is not a good year to argue for his policies to help some rich people get richer.\u201d\n\nAnd Bob Dane, communications director for FAIR, said charges of nativism are \u201csimply a propaganda tool to discredit groups with whom other groups disagree.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just a crude, transparent tactic to stop the debate,\u201d he added.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:41.878+0000"}
{"entityId": 1826, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Why the Catholic convert\u2019s willingness to talk theology in front of an evangelical audience is a big deal.\n\nEvangelicals aren\u2019t typically the target audience for Roman Catholic theology talk. Low-church Protestants from the Bible Belt have historically been hostile to Catholicism, even sometimes fearing that Catholics\u2019 devotion to the pope will lead to one-world government, and that their political clout in the United States presages the end times.\n\nSo it was perhaps a little surprising when Jeb Bush, who converted to his wife\u2019s Catholicism, launched into an emotional testimony before a predominantly evangelical audience on Friday about the joy he felt when he left Protestantism.\n\nCatholics and Evangelicals haven\u2019t always played well together. In 2008, Rev. John Hagee\u2014a Texas pastor and one of the country\u2019s most powerful evangelical leaders\u2014apologized to Bill Donohue of the Catholic League for intimating that the Catholic church was the \u201cgreat whore\u201d of Revelation, and for telegraphing the kind of anti-Catholic rhetoric typically associated with 19th-century nativists. (Among Southern Baptists, in particular, there\u2019s long been a flamboyantly anti-Catholic strain of thought and rhetoric.) And while conservative Catholics and evangelical Protestants are simpatico when it comes to certain public policy goals, they usually avoid public discussions about areas of theological disagreement.\n\nBut here in a ballroom in a hotel in D.C.\u2019s Woodley Park neighborhood, Bush decided that courting the country\u2019s leading social conservative activists could entail discussing one of the elements of Catholic theology that\u2019s least amenable to evangelicals\u2014namely the blessed sacraments, which include confession and communion.\n\n\u201cI converted to the Catholic Church\u2014Christ came into my life a little earlier, but I converted to being Catholic in honor of my wife and because I believe in the blessed sacraments and they give me great comfort,\u201d he said at the beginning of his speech before the Faith and Freedom Coalition. \u201cOn Easter Sabbath of 1995, I had lost an election in 1994 and found a total serenity and solace in the RCIA class, and converted to being a Catholic and it\u2019s been an organizing part of my architecture, if you will, as a person and certainly as an elected official.\u201d\n\nRCIA stands for Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults, and refers to the catechesis process that would-be Catholic converts go through before entering the Church.\n\nEvangelicals, needless to say, do not see the act of leaving Protestantism as something that should necessarily be a source of \u201ctotal serenity and solace.\u201d\n\nEvangelicals, needless to say, do not see the act of leaving Protestantism as something that should necessarily be a source of \u201ctotal serenity and solace.\u201d And sometimes, as in Hagee\u2019s case, their leaders show outright hostility to those who jump ship. So Bush\u2019s willingness to talk explicitly about his decision to leave behind the Protestantism that galvanizes so many members of the Faith and Freedom Coalition audience reflects an important shift in the way social conservatives talk to each other.\n\nYes, the two groups have long been political allies\u2014the evangelical George W. Bush handily won Catholics in 2004, and the stalwart Catholic Rick Santorum was kept afloat in the 2012 GOP primary by Southern evangelicals. But increasingly, evangelical Christians and conservative Roman Catholics are finding common ground not just in their shared political concerns but also in a shared language about personal devotion to faith.\n\nAnd that shared devotion played heavily in Bush\u2019s speech, as he reiterated his support for the Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of Catholic nuns embroiled in a fight with the federal government over contraceptive coverage, and his repulsion with Hillary Clinton\u2019s comment that \u201creligious beliefs\u2026have to be changed.\u201d Clinton\u2019s camp hasn\u2019t clarified which specific religious beliefs she thinks must change, but conservatives like Bush have taken the comment as a direct attack on their pro-life convictions. Bush\u2019s criticism of Clinton\u2019s comment drew warm applause from the crowd.\n\nPenny Nance, an evangelical Christian who heads the conservative Concerned Women for America, said those comments reflect growing unity and cooperation between conservative Catholics and evangelicals.\n\n\u201cWe are more united than we have been in my lifetime, certainly,\u201d she said. \u201cCatholics and evangelicals have certainly linked arms and will continue to link arms over the issue of life and marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeb embracing his Catholicism is not a problem for evangelicals,\u201d she added.\n\nNance would know\u2014she wrote a Fox News op-ed in February of 2012 titled \u201c We are all Catholics now\u201d. And Patricia Miller of Salon argued in March of this year that white Catholics\u2019 increasing affinity for the GOP could become a problem for the Democratic party.\n\n\u201c[F]or the first time, white Catholics are more Republican than the voting group usually considered the ultimate Republicans: white Protestants,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIt\u2019s just one more indicator that despite a fraught history, Protestant Evangelicals and conservative Catholics have become a cohesive political unit. As the two groups become more and more closely allied on public policy issues, and as they both increasingly adopt a defensive posture in the culture wars, conservative Catholic candidates like Bush will feel more comfortable talking about their faith in more explicit ways before Evangelical audiences.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:42.167+0000"}

But with his poor poll numbers and no longer golden establishment ties, he\u2019s not the most formidable.\n\nAs we know, the search for an \u201cestablishment\u201d candidate has been on in the GOP for a while now, a savior who can rescue the party from Rand Paul or Ted Cruz. That man, of course, is Jeb Bush. Last week on Hardball, Kathleen Parker said he is definitely running. She\u2019s a conservative columnist but not a wacko, has establishment GOP credentials and Florida ties to boot. And she spoke with the air of someone who had had this nugget leaked to her specifically so that she would go out on national TV and blurt it out.\n\nSo take the idea of a Bush candidacy seriously. He\u2019ll get many of the biggest donors and most plugged-in operatives, and he\u2019ll immediately be spoken of by the media as a, if not the, GOP front-runner.\n\nSo far, so normal. But here\u2019s where things get interesting. Historically, \u201cestablishment\u201d in this context also basically means \u201cmost formidable\u201d and \u201cmost electable.\u201d Look at the track record. Mitt Romney was the establishment candidate in 2012, John McCain in 2008, Jeb\u2019s brother in 2000. Two of these three never became president, but there\u2019s no doubt that all three were the best the GOP had to offer in their given years. Who would have run better than McCain in 2008? Maybe, possibly Romney himself. But not Mike Huckabee or Ron Paul. And 2012\u2019s lineup besides Romney was comic relief. Any one of them couldn\u2019t have topped 200 electoral votes. And Dubya, of course, won. (Well, \u201cwon,\u201d but that\u2019s a different column.)\n\nIt\u2019s an iron law of presidential politics: The establishment candidate is, almost by definition, the most formidable candidate. Well, I guess iron ain\u2019t what it used to be, because here\u2019s the funny thing: Jeb Bush is not any stronger against Hillary Clinton than any of the rest of them. Establishment no longer means most formidable.\n\nLast week\u2019s NBC/Wall Street Journal poll was only the most recent survey to affirm it\u2014Jeb Bush just isn\u2019t very popular, and as for his presidential prospects, a lot of Americans seem to agree with his mother. The numbers are just hideous for him. He\u2019s viewed more negatively than positively by 31 to 21 percent (just 21 percent positive!); he\u2019s minus-7 on that question among independents. Some other polls in recent months have shown Jeb Bush to be seen less favorably than he was a couple of years ago\u2014that is, as presidential chatter has increased, he\u2019s dropped.\n\nIn general, he appears to fare no better against Clinton than any of the other Republicans, and in some polls worse. Look at some of the numbers amassed at the Real Clear Politics site. In a recent Colorado poll, Bush did worse against Clinton than Paul, Mike Huckabee, and Chris Christie. (Paul even led Clinton by five points in this poll, suggesting that the libertarians stoners are all in for him.) In a Wisconsin survey, Clinton led Huckabee by 12 and Bush and Paul both by 11. In a national Marist poll from April 15, Clinton led Paul Ryan by eight, Christie by 11, Huckabee by 13, Paul by 14, Cruz by 15, and Bush by 16. That\u2019s right\u2014dead last. Behind Cruz. Yes, we\u2019re talking margin of error stuff here, but still, when they crunched the numbers, Bush was dead last.\n\nIn almost every head-to-head poll against Clinton you look at Bush is down there with the pack\u2014a couple of points better than Marco Rubio, a couple worse than Christie, and so on. All of them are typically anywhere from eight to 15 points behind her.\n\nBush doesn\u2019t have problems just against Clinton. The NBC/Journal survey found that among \u201canimated partisans,\u201d 58 percent liked Paul and only 44 percent viewed Bush favorably. A WMUR New Hampshire poll recently found Bush in a distant fourth place behind Paul, Christie, and Ryan. More typically in GOP primary polling, Bush is in the first tier\u2014but he is never clearly in front, the way an establishment candidate is supposed to be.\n\nHe\u2019s ham-handed, and he\u2019s been terrible at generating any positive attention for himself in the last couple of years.\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem? For one thing, Bush has real liabilities. He hasn\u2019t been in office for eight years. He\u2019s simply a little out of practice. His interventions over the past year\u2014his book, for example\u2014just haven\u2019t done for his profile what he hoped. That statement about undocumented immigrants coming to America illegally as an \u201cact of love\u201d was all right by me, but I\u2019m not a GOP primary voter. And even I thought that was kind of an odd way to put it. He\u2019s ham-handed, and he\u2019s been terrible at generating any positive attention for himself in the last couple of years. For a rich guy who doesn\u2019t have to work, that shouldn\u2019t be so hard. Remember how back in the mid-2000s, GOP operatives speaking on background used to drop quotes in the press averring that he was \u201cthe smart one\u201d? Well, lately I\u2019ve been thinking maybe George was the smart one.\n\nSo that\u2019s the part of the problem that has to do with Bush himself. But the other part of his problem has to do with the party. As I\u2019ve written before, the GOP has almost always nominated the establishment guy. But this might be a different GOP\u2014a party in which the establishment paladins just might not be in control of things the way they once were. And if Christie is not indicted or tarnished and does run, then they\u2019ll have two establishment candidates splitting the big donors and the non-radical voters. That would grease Paul\u2019s path like nothing else.\n\nSo if Kathleen Parker is right and Bush does jump in, as you read all those stories crowning him the new favorite because he\u2019s the establishment, just remember that while he may be the establishment choice, in this GOP, that doesn\u2019t count for much.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:42.663+0000"}

We watched the most frightening terrorist group ever imagined massacring and raping its way through the Middle East.

It is one of the reasons we elected him in the first place. His constant failure to say anything inspiring or original or memorable is one of the most obvious disappointments of his presidency.

But the White House is using a series of maneuvers to make sure that never happens.\n\nIn recent days, leading lawmakers in both parties have been talking tough about forcing the Obama administration to devise and then reveal its strategy to \u201cdegrade and destroy\u201d ISIS, as President Obama has promised. There have been public calls for hearings and votes on whether Congress should formally give Obama the authority to do what he\u2019s already doing in Iraq and what he might soon want to do in Syria.\n\nBut behind the scenes, there\u2019s no clear plan for Congress to exert its will or even make its wishes known. Lawmakers, staffers, and officials told The Daily Beast that the administration\u2019s refusal to tell anyone its strategy and work with Congress on a bill to authorize military action means the task of passing such a bill is a Sisyphean effort likely to fail. The Hill may not even be able to muster a vote, they say.\n\n\u201cMembers will certainly have discussions about the path forward on [ISIS] when they return next week, but how could Congress vote to authorize some action when the president hasn\u2019t even made a compelling case to the American people about what our national objective and strategy should be?\u201d a senior House GOP aide told The Daily Beast.\n\nThere\u2019s widespread frustration in both chambers and both parties about President Obama\u2019s admission that \u201cwe don\u2019t have a strategy yet\u201d to deal with ISIS in Iraq and Syria. But now the lack of strategy is actually protecting Obama from oversight because Congress can\u2019t authorize or reject what it can\u2019t understand.\n\nIn fact, the White House has been totally mum on how it plans to legally justify the air war in Iraq after the temporary authority granted to it in the War Powers Resolution expires. According to the 1973 law, the president must report to Congress when he uses U.S. military force in a hostile environment; Congress must then specifically authorize such action within 60 days or the president has to stop. The president can invoke a one-time, 30-day extension.\n\nBut, so far, there have been no substantial consultations with Congress about such an authorization. The White House declined to say whether it even cared if Congress acts or not.\n\n\u201cHow could Congress vote to authorize some action when the president hasn\u2019t even made a compelling case to the American people about what our national objective and strategy should be?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe administration will continue to consult with the Congress on the way forward in Iraq and our efforts against [ISIS], and we will continue to provide appropriate reports to the Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution. Beyond that, I don\u2019t have anything to announce. Thanks!\u201d Caitlin Hayden, press secretary for the National Security Council, told The Daily Beast.\n\nThe administration has now reported to Congress three times under the War Powers Resolution about U.S. military force in Iraq; the first report was filed Aug. 8 and the most recent was filed Sept. 1. The reports notified Congress that the U.S. was waging war in Iraq for four distinct reasons: to protect American personnel in Erbil; to save the Yazidi minorities trapped on Mount Sinjar; to protect the Mosul Dam; and to save the people of the Shiite town of Amirli.\n\nThe War Powers clock expires Oct. 8, with a possible extension to Nov. 8. But the administration could argue that each new notification resets the clock and gives the president ongoing authority to attack in Iraq. To most in Congress, that\u2019s disingenuous at best, because the strikes are all part of the same operation and are all against the same foe in the same country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called the War Powers Act, not the Single Attack Powers Act. Technically you are not restarting the 60-day clock,\u201d said a senior Senate aide involved in the debate.\n\nDuring Obama\u2019s war on Libya in 2011, he used military strikes well past the 60- or even 90-day deadline. Then he tried to claim there were no \u201chostilities\u201d in Libya, to nullify the War Powers Resolution. This time around, Obama\u2019s lawyers were more clever.\n\n\u201cThe Libya episode taught him the lesson you can trust on 60 to 90 days, so instead they are trying to press the reset button on the clock,\u201d the aide said. \u201cIn the end, the administration wants to hang this on the president\u2019s authority under Article 2 (of the Constitution). The problem is, some of these strikes don\u2019t fall under Article 2.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a legal shell game,\u201d a senior GOP senate aide said. \u201cBut more than that, it\u2019s an ad hoc reaction to a threat. And so, the legal rationale that flows from that is minimal because what he\u2019s doing is minimal.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a growing consensus in both parties that the president has to do more to combat the growing ISIS threat and come to Congress for some kind of legal endorsement. Even GOP doves like Sen. Rand Paul have changed their tune recently and pledged to grant Obama permission to strike the terror group.\n\n\u201cI think we all agree that having a national strategy for defeating the Islamic terrorist state is imperative,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner told his caucus on a conference call Wednesday, according to a source on the call. \u201cAmerica is at risk of another 9/11 unless we confront and defeat this terrorist threat. The safety and security of the American people, and that of our allies, is at stake.\u201d\n\nBut with only two weeks in September to legislate, there\u2019s little to no chance Congress will act before its next recess, which means the issue will be punted to the post-election lame duck session. During that session, several senators will try to add amendments authorizing Obama\u2019s ISIS war to the National Defense Authorization Act\u2014the bill that sets policies for the Pentagon\u2014which is seen on Capitol Hill as a must-pass.\n\nSen. Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, has drafted legislation that would authorize the president to use military force against ISIS, and is conferring with Senate colleagues about what changes would be required to gather bipartisan support.\n\n\"The only way to get the House to change their mind would be either the Senate sends a strong bipartisan message by passing an AUMF [Authorization of Military Force], or by passing an amendment to the NDAA,\" said Donelle Harder, an Inhofe aide.\n\nSenator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, has also drafted legislation that would specifically authorize Obama to strike ISIS inside Syria, where Florida-born journalist Steven Sotloff was murdered this week. Nelson wants to add his legislation to the Defense Authorization bill as well, his spokesman Ryan Brown said.\n\n\u201cThis will ensure there\u2019s no question that the president has the legal authority he needs to use airstrikes in Syria,\u201d Nelson said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cLet there be no doubt, we must go after ISIS right away because the U.S. is the only one that can put together a coalition to stop this group that\u2019s intent on barbaric cruelty.\u201d\n\nSenate Foreign Relations heads Bob Menendez and Bob Corker are sure to want to fight for jurisdiction over any authorization of military force, which would traditionally fall under their committee. But they haven\u2019t weighed in yet. For a long time, they have been trying to repeal and replace the original 2001 AUMF that authorizes the president to go after al Qaeda. That effort could potentially be connected to the ISIS war. But for now, the path forward is uncertain.\n\nMenendez and Corker are trying to schedule a hearing on Iraq this month with Secretary of State John Kerry. Earlier this year, Kerry cancelled scheduled appearances before his old committee multiple times and there is still bad blood over what senators felt was disrespect on Kerry\u2019s part.\n\nMany lawmakers still feel burned from the episode last year when Obama pushed them to vote for a strike against Syria, only to cancel the strike last minute and leave them hanging. For some, weighing in on Obama\u2019s ISIS war now would just give the president political cover for a policy they think is incomplete, striking ISIS one truck at a time in Iraq and ignoring them in Syria. If senators vote for that, they would be agreeing to share the blame if and when that strategy fails.\n\n\u201cIf you are going to come to Congress, come to Congress to ask for a real authority to take on something that is a direct threat to the national interests of the United States and link that authority to an overall strategy. You could get congressional support or something like that,\u201d said another senior GOP Senate aide. \u201cThe president has to be the prime mover. He has to come to Congress and say, \u2018Look, guys, here\u2019s what we need to do and here\u2019s what we need to do it.\u2019 And that hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d\n\n\u2014 with additional reporting by Tim Mak", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:42.971+0000"}
{"entityId": 1830, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The American people didn\u2019t demand that we torture detainees and embark on permanent war after 9/11. Our politicians and pundits did.\n\n\u201cThe American people were demanding that the government do anything necessary to keep the country safe.\u201d That has become a talking point exonerating American torture after 9/11, which a Congressional investigation has recently recently detailed. It is a convenient story: the government was faithfully obeying the people, and the people were shocked by events, freshly aware that the world is a dangerous place. Understandably, mistakes were made.\n\nThis story is almost criminally wrong. The 9/11 attacks were shocking and frightening, of course. They did just what terrorism aims to do: shattered the unthinking, complacent security of a peaceful country, and revealed the fragility of things.\n\nIt was also a hugely open, uncertain moment. People were scared but, just as much, confused. We had no mental category for such an attack. I vividly recall, that day and the weeks afterward, people groping for a decent way forward. Should we cancel gatherings, reunions, excursions, or throw ourselves into them with even more gratitude for one another? Should we stay away from cities or flood into them? Nothing was obvious.\n\nMost of all, it was not obvious that the government would soon throw itself into kinds of violence and surveillance that had been almost unimaginable during my post-Vietnam lifetime. There was no spontaneous call for torture\u2014nor, for that matter, for war in two countries, only one of them even arguably connected with the attacks. The policies that followed were not serving democratic demands.\n\nInstead, politicians and pundits rushed to tell the public what the events meant. George W. Bush\u2019s \u201caxis of evil\u201d and \u201cwar on terror\u201d militarized national consciousness and drove political language far from pragmatism and nuance toward black-and-white absolutes. Centrist pundits like Thomas Friedman said war was justified to show American resolve and set Arab countries back on their heels\u2014telling them to \u201csuck on this,\u201d as Friedman put it. Fear and belligerence ran together.\n\nA certain kind of intellectual loves to show that he (usually he) is no pussy, that he can stand up with the toughest tough guys \u2013 usually by sending the actual tough guys, soldiers and CIA operatives, on life-threatening and destructive missions.\n\nAt the same time, pundits began normalizing talk of torture, which for decades had been beyond the pale. Alan Dershowitz wrote in 2001 that torture should simply require a warrant. This was ostensibly to extend the rule of law by guaranteeing due process, but the real effect was to corrupt law and morality by bending them to make torture seem normal and lawful. Five years later, after the first revelations of \u201cblack sites\u201d and \u201cextreme rendition,\u201d Charles Krauthammer was still arguing that \u201cIt would be a gross dereliction of duty for any government not to keep Khalid Sheikh Mohammed isolated, disoriented, alone, despairing, cold and sleepless, in some godforsaken hidden location.\u201d He did not mention rectal feeding, but perhaps he was not fully briefed.\n\nArguments for torture tended to start with the \u201cticking time bomb\u201d scenario, the hypothetical in which a bomb is about to go off and only the torture victim knows how to defuse it. But this was just the opening move. The real effect of constant fear-mongering, whether for political gain or to promote wars whose advocates thought they would be geopolitically constructive, was to make everyday life feel like the ticking-bomb scenario, to make fear an ordinary emotion, and no-holds-barred violence an ordinary response.\n\nIt was also an occasion for voluptuary displays of tough-mindedness. A certain kind of intellectual loves to show that he (usually he) is no pussy, that he can stand up with the toughest tough guys\u2014usually by sending the actual tough guys, soldiers and CIA operatives, on life-threatening and destructive missions. Disgustingly, this testosterone-injected preening was a major note, sometimes the dominant one, in political leadership for seven years after 9/11.\n\nThe eventual public revulsion at the wars and the torture shows a deep and abiding potential for decency, which reasserted itself in the face of huge pressure to embrace state violence, big and small, as the new normal. Turning now to blame the American people for that violence is especially repellent for this reason.\n\nMoreover, no one\u2019s hands are clean here, and blame shifting tends to dissolve the issue when what we really need is a reckoning. It\u2019s true that the country went along too easily with fear and violence. It is also true\u2014and this is inconvenient\u2014that the US had not been innocent in the decades leading up to 9/11. Our proxies in Latin America, from Pinochet\u2019s Chile to the death squads of El Salvador, tortured their countrymen, often for advocating democracy. When torture became US policy, it was a kind of terrible homecoming; but no one in the countries where our proxy wars were fought could imagine that the US had much innocence to lose.\n\nHere at home, though, we did. It is a clich\u00e9 that war tests a country; but it is at least as true, and much easier to overlook, that a people has to be worthy of civilian life. A world of peace, personal freedom, and social fairness, a world centered on the ordinary life of family, work, and neighborhood, is a precious achievement that deserves defense. Defending it properly means preserving its values\u2014principles of decency and humanitarianism\u2014not putting up a fence of violence and fear around it.\n\nThe race to torture and war after 9/11 betrayed the principles of civilian life. Maybe there is some connection between that betrayal and the fearful violence we have tolerated in mass incarceration and excessive, unresponsive policing. Maybe the movement now growing around police violence and the racial inequities of the criminal justice system is, in some oblique way, an attempt to take back and extend the civilian value of shared peace and decency that fell from our grasp after 9/11. If so, we still have a long way to go in overcoming the consequences of permanent war, the policy\u2014and the national story\u2014that the country adopted after the attacks.\n\nEither way, we Americans have plenty to answer for and reckon with. But demanding torture and war is not on that list. Leaders with political and intellectual responsibilities conjured up those evils, and the results are on their hands.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:44.556+0000"}
{"entityId": 1831, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Wendy Davis\u2019 abortion revelations raise the question: Can abortion be the most compassionate choice? Some religious leaders say yes.\n\nWhen news broke that Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis had previously terminated two pregnancies for medical reasons, she received words of compassion from a surprising source. A spokesperson for Texas Right to Life called \u201cthe value of life precious\u201d but nevertheless also stated, \u201cOur heart goes out for the decision she had to make.\u201d Part of what has struck a chord about Davis\u2019 story is that it serves as a potent reminder that the factors that go into the decision of whether to have an abortion are rarely as black and white as public political debates pretend they are.\n\nHer story highlights the moral, ethical, and spiritual uncertainty that many Americans feel on the issue of abortion, particularly when confronted with the harrowing details of real women\u2019s stories. In Davis\u2019 case, one pregnancy was a danger to her own health, thus necessitating termination. But in another her fetus, if she survived birth, would have emerged deaf, blind, with a deformed brain, and in a permanent vegetative state.\n\nDavis makes it clear this was a pregnancy that was greeted with joy, and that the aftermath caused great sorrow. But she expressed no regrets mainly because of her concerns about how much her fetus suffered before termination. Her candid confession gets at the heart of the debate for many over the issue of abortion, particularly people of faith: Can abortion sometimes be the most compassionate choice? More pointedly, can supporting abortion rights be compatible with Christianity?\n\nSince the Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion nationally, efforts to criminalize it have been led in large part by high-profile religious leaders, religious groups, and activists whose politics are defined in large part by their religious identity. In the 41 years since Roe, the Religious Right, (sometimes called the Christian Right), has become a major force in national politics, with each Republican president since Ronald Reagan owing his election to its key players, among them Pat Robertson, the late Jerry Falwell, and others. Their influence in politics and ubiquity in the media created the impression that being religious, particularly identifying as a Christian, means opposing abortion.\n\nBut interviews with various clergy members and religious scholars indicate that there is far from a consensus that \u201cChristian\u201d = \u201copposed to abortion.\u201d Rev. Jacqui Lewis, who holds a PhD in psychology and religion, wrote in an email, \u201cI am a practicing Christian and I am pro-choice. Those are compatible.\u201d She elaborated, \u201cI am a Christian, a pastor, a counselor and I know from counseling that when women make this decision, it is a painful one, often a heart breaking one. But personally, I believe it is their right to decide, in conversation with their partner or spouse, their family, their spiritual leader and their God.\u201d\n\nPenny Nance, President of Concerned Women for America, one of the most influential conservative women\u2019s groups in the nation, disagreed strongly. Concerned Women for America describes its mission as \u201cto protect and promote Biblical values among all citizens,\u201d and Nance considers a core part of that work advocating the end of legalized abortion. In an email, Nance wrote: \u201cPeople who truly believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God and have actually read it cannot honestly conclude that abortion is not a sin that damages a woman\u2019s soul and stains her conscience.\u201d Despite being a survivor of an assault and attempted rape, Nance has remained steadfast in her belief that abortion is the taking of a life and therefore not compatible with being a devout Christian, even though she did stress she believes in forgiveness and redemption. \u201cIt is not enough to make abortion illegal,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe strive to make it unthinkable.\u201d\n\nPriests who try to bully those who are pro-choice out of taking a communion are behaving in a \u201cdisgraceful\u201d manner using the sacrament as a \u201cpolitical football.\u201d\n\nThis interpretation of the Bible is shared by Dr. Corne J. Bekker, who cited a number of scriptures that he believes make the position of the church on abortion clear. Bekker, chairman of Biblical Studies and Christian Ministry at Regent University, which was founded by Pat Robertson, pointed most notably to the commandment against murder. He also cited a passage in Exodus 21:22 that reads, \u201cWhen men strive together and hit a pregnant woman, so that her children come out, but there is no harm, the one who hit her shall surely be fined, as the woman\u2019s husband shall impose on him, and he shall pay as the judges determine. But if there is harm, then you shall pay life for life.\u201d He concluded, \u201cIt is my opinion that Christians should be united in their opposition of all forms of abortion, with the one exception of an urgent medical condition where both the mother and the unborn baby would die unless a termination of the pregnancy would occur.\u201d\n\nYet there are four primary complications for many Christians when it comes to defining their positions on abortion. The first is the unresolved debate within Christianity regarding the extent to which our modern-day actions should be governed by Old Testament law. In addition to the passage from Exodus cited above, there are all sorts of directives about sacrificing bulls and turtledoves that are no longer held to ironclad interpretation and practice by 21st-century Christians and clergy.\n\nThe next complication is the lack of scientific and religious clarity over how to define when life begins. The third issue for debate among devout Christians regarding abortion rights, and one of the most important, is determining whether something that one may believe morally to be wrong or even a sin should be legislated. But perhaps the greatest complication of all is this: What if an action you would normally interpret as constituting a sin results in an outcome that appears more compassionate for all involved, such as in Wendy Davis\u2019 case?\n\nTom Davis (no relation to Wendy) is very clear in his perspective on this. Davis is a former chaplain and associate professor of religion at Skidmore College. During his time there, Davis counseled students seeking abortions. In some instances he would refer women in need to doctors he knew who performed them before the procedure became legal. In 1967 Davis joined the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion, a network of 1,400 members of the clergy who helped women access safe abortions nationwide in the days before Roe v. Wade.\n\nDavis would play a key role in opening the nation\u2019s first legal abortion clinic in New York when the procedure became legal there more than a year before Roe. In a phone interview Davis said there are texts for some religions that address abortion specifically, such as in ancient Babylonia, but this is not the case in Christianity: \u201cThere is no law against abortion in the Bible. There is no law about birth control in the Bible. So when you don\u2019t have a specific guidance on something, you look at what is the most human thing to do in a situation, what is most helpful and sometimes abortion is indicated.\u201d\n\nAsked for an example of abortion being a more humane choice he recalled a situation from his days as a counselor when a woman came to him crushed because her husband had been killed. Though they had planned her third pregnancy, she was now barely able to support the two children they had before his death. Blaming sexism for much of the organized opposition to abortion among religious leaders, he said, \u201cThere are many reasons why a woman needs an abortion. Sometimes rape, sometimes because she says \u2018I can\u2019t be responsible for this child and can\u2019t bring a child into this world I can\u2019t care for.\u2019\u201d He also said from a compassionate standpoint as a Christian if one knows women could face injury and death while trying to obtain illegal abortions, then standing in the way is willfully contributing to tragedy.\n\nJon O\u2019Brien, a devout Catholic and president of Catholics for Choice, explained that Catholicism values the expertise of the faith\u2019s great scholars, and that among them, Saint Augustine and Saint Aquinas did not consider a fetus in the earliest stages of pregnancy to be a person. The Catholic faith is rooted in emphasizing the importance of following one\u2019s conscience, he said, and for some women that will mean choosing to terminate a pregnancy because that is what is best as they see it. Priests who try to bully those who are pro-choice out of taking communion are behaving in a \u201cdisgraceful\u201d manner and are using the sacrament as a \u201cpolitical football,\u201d he said. He also accused the Catholic hierarchy of being \u201cstuck in the pelvic zone.\u201d He concluded, \u201cWe do respect them, but it doesn\u2019t mean they are always right. And on issues of sexuality they are profoundly wrong.\u201d\n\nGloria Feldt, the former president of Planned Parenthood, recalled that one of the co-founders of the Planned Parenthood of Arizona chapter was a former Catholic priest who became an Episcopal priest because he saw the impact that a lack of access to birth control and abortion had on the lives of women, particularly poor women in the community. Feldt, who now runs Take the Lead, a group devoted to increasing gender parity in leadership positions, predicted women\u2019s leadership may ultimately play a defining role in where faith and reproductive rights intersect in the future. \u201cIf you think about the underlying misogyny in the history of most major religions, it\u2019s not surprising we\u2019ve been dealing with these issues [reproductive rights] in those terms,\u201d she said. \u201cI do believe that the ascent of more women in the clergy, at least in the mainstream religions at this point, is going to make a huge difference. They simply see the world through a different lens.\u201d\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:45.303+0000"}

That changes things, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nFor a lot of people, actually no, it doesn\u2019t. Progressives in the grip of one of their signature moral crusades routinely embrace money in politics for me, but not for thee.\n\nBarack Obama set the tone in 2008, when he became the first presidential candidate in history to reject public funds\u2014the better to combat money in politics, of course. In a video he taped to explain the move, Obama vowed that only fire could fight fire. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy decision, and especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections. But the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken, and we face opponents who\u2019ve become masters at gaming this broken system.\u201d\n\nThen, in 2013, Obama sent a wave of horror through his own party by launching Organizing for Action, a political pressure group that refused to share money with the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThe group helped set the pattern Bloomberg is using to lend his intimidating campaign some moral heft. Out to raise \u201cunlimited amounts of cash,\u201d Organizing for Action would hammer on \u201ccurbing gun violence,\u201d among other \u201ctop issues\u201d for the president, all while remaining technically \u201cnonpartisan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means the group might find itself opposing not just Republicans but also Democrats,\u201d McClatchy dutifully observed, \u201cincluding the more conservative members of the party on gun control.\u201d\n\nConfronted with enduring fears among leading Democrats that his $50 million initiative will throw control of the Senate to Republicans, Bloomberg\u2019s response embraced the president\u2019s logic: claim to transcend partisan politics, and you\u2019ll legitimize the fear you sow among your opponents. \u201cYou can tell me all you want that the Republicans would be worse in the Senate than the Democrats,\u201d Bloomberg told the New York Times. \u201cMaybe they would. But that\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d\n\nAlthough any hot-button issue can lay bare the way fear fuels money in politics, the gun issue does it best. Guns reach to the heart of how we Americans view ourselves as a people. Ask us what we think about guns, and we\u2019ll tell you what we think about our society\u2014and our country, and the human condition.\n\nAsk us what we think about guns, and we\u2019ll tell you what we think about our society\u2014and our country, and the human condition.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s new gun-control group is already showing how. Everytown for Gun Safety, as it\u2019s known, is the culmination of a political agenda that began in the wake of the Newtown shootings. There, America\u2019s contemporary fear of guns came into sharp relief.\n\nNot that long ago, the gun issue was predominantly viewed through the lens of law and order. In the 1970s, when crime in New York City became a symbol of national malaise, urban neoconservatives who felt \u201cmugged by reality\u201d joined forces with Americans who feared a real-life mugging, or worse. Criminals and gangs were thought to be motivated by a debased sense of honor or a simple desire to seize property.\n\nThe first-wave neocons may have been comfortable with secularism, but for most Americans who associated gun violence with increasing crime and lawlessness, the problem cohered with a Biblical view of disorder. The wages of sins like pride and greed, after all, were death.\n\nIn the current anti-gun climate that Bloomberg seeks to lead, that religious view has given way to something much different. Over the past several decades, but especially after Newtown, our fear of guns has shifted away from a fear of sinful people to a fear of sick ones. Blaming Marilyn Manson for school massacres is out. Blaming mental disorders and untreated illness is in.\n\nIronically, the old religious view made room for a not particularly pious variety of macho \u201cjustice\u201d-seeking. Today\u2019s more secular view, by contrast, tends to privilege women\u2019s attitudes, especially mothers. Bloomberg's crew has developed their political strategy accordingly. \u201cThe key to whether they can be effective,\u201d the mayor and his advisers told the Times, \u201cwill be turning out female voters, the sought-after swing bloc that has been pivotal in recent elections.\u201d Their goal is to mobilize women who see guns as the most terrifying way cruel fate sends death to shockingly ruin our lives.\n\nThat\u2019s not a bad-faith approach. It squares with our growing sense that God doesn\u2019t care if your child accidentally shoots off her own face, or if your boy is gunned down in class by a soulless, disturbed loner. It squares with our existential horror over watching \u201ca mother\u2019s worst nightmare\u201d played out over and over again on cable TV.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much that we privilege maternal love, although we probably still do. It\u2019s that more and more of us have stopped believing that providence oversees our destiny. In the absence of faith, the fear of fate flows in. Instead of purpose, however painful or sorrow-stricken, we see randomness\u2014blind, uncaring, brutal accident\u2014irrupt into our fragile lives.\n\nUnder the strain of that feeling, many single men through the ages have adopted a devil-may-care attitude. Fewer mothers have. In the most emotionally accurate moment in Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Noah, Jennifer Connelly\u2019s Naameh turns with heartbroken fury on her husband, insisting he is badly mistaken that God wants him to kill off their own grandchildren.\n\nToday, however, Americans often don\u2019t scream at God or the faithful when children are slain with guns. We scream at how senseless the violence seems, how meaninglessness the tragedy. And for that reason, we scream at government. We scream about the laws. There is nowhere else to turn.\n\nGiven our current stage of social development, that may make all the sense in the world. But it stands as a gruesome reminder of why politics is becoming the place we go to answer the question, \u201cWho should I fear today?\u201d\n\nFrom that perspective, it\u2019s no surprise progressives throw vast sums into politics, even though it often dismays them to do so.\n\nHowever hypocritical, they\u2019re willing to do what it takes to prove Thomas Hobbes right. Hundreds of years ago, the author of Leviathan warned that the only just, sane, and safe world is one where we don\u2019t fear each other because the government overawes us all.\n\nAs so many of our other venerable social dreams die around us, Hobbes\u2019s utopia may be well the last to go.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:45.581+0000"}
{"entityId": 1833, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "They\u2019ve accused the senator of shape-shifting before, but now they\u2019re positively apoplectic he signed the GOP\u2019s Iran letter\u2014and one of his biggest defenders says it\u2019s \u2018the last straw.\u2019\n\nOn a Saturday afternoon in mid-January, Brett H. Pojunis, the chairman of the Nevada Libertarian Party, stood outside his office on Flamingo Road in Las Vegas, ashing a cigarette and dissing Rand Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re the Libertarian Party,\u201d he told me, dramatically stretching out the word in his New York accent. Paul, a member of the Republican Party, was in town for a visit ahead of formally launching his bid for the White House, and Pojunis didn\u2019t particularly care.\n\n\u201cLibertarian,\u201d he said, is now just \u201ca buzzword\u201d for Republicans like the Kentucky senator. If Paul was really so libertarian, Pojunis had some advice for him: \u201cWell, OK then\u2014join the Libertarian Party!\u201d\n\nPojunis led me inside past some staffers hunched over a computer trying to select a new party logo. \u201cIs this too swastika-y?\u201d he asked, pointing to an image closely resembling the Nazi insignia. We walked past a room cluttered with memorabilia from Baywatch, the 1990s TV show featuring bikini-clad lifeguards, and Pojunis explained that it was the personal office of Michael Burke, the creator of the show and a possible Libertarian Party candidate. \u201cHe literally has a key to the Playboy Mansion,\u201d Pojunis said.\n\nAnecdotally, when I\u2019ve talked to Libertarians who identify as Paul supporters\u2014particularly those who campaigned for his father, former congressman and two-time presidential candidate Ron Paul\u2014they acknowledge the reality that Rand Paul may be the best ambassador to the mainstream political world they will ever get. In other words, the senator is not the ideal libertarian (an oxymoronic phrase, given the amount of infighting among libertarians about what exactly that is), but he comes close enough, and certainly closer than any other likely presidential candidate.\n\nBut Pojunis and his aides said those Paul supporters were fools. Libertarians who back Paul, he said, are \u201cgetting all the downside of compromise and none of the upside.\u201d\n\nTwo months ago, there was little reason to think that Nevada\u2019s Libertarian Party, which is considered slightly off the rails even among fellow libertarians, represented anyone other than its own 12,000 members. But some of Paul\u2019s recent foreign policy pronouncements have some libertarians, especially those who gravitated to his father for his steadfast opposition to the war in Iraq and George W. Bush\u2019s hyper-hawkishness, sounding like Pojunis and his fellow Nevada radicals.\n\nThe breaking point came on March 9, when Paul was faced with one of the most challenging decisions of his political career.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) penned an open letter to \u201cthe leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d The letter stated, rather condescendingly, that Iranian leaders \u201cdo not fully understand our constitutional system.\u201d Soon a new president would be in office, Cotton wrote, and that president could (if Republican, would) \u201crevoke\u201d any executive agreement President Obama signs.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re compromising and then you\u2019re going to lose anyway, why are you compromising to begin with? Then you lose your whole base.\u201d\n\nCotton, a neoconservative beloved by Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, one of the most influential organs that supported the invasion of Iraq, opposes U.S. engagement with Iran, and he has previously expressed a desire to halt any dialogue between the two countries over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cThe end of these negotiations isn\u2019t an unintended consequence of congressional action,\u201d Cotton told the Heritage Foundation in January. \u201cIt is very much an intended consequence. A feature, not a bug, so to speak.\u201d\n\nPaul has historically favored the negotiations Cotton seeks to stop. In 2012, he objected to new sanctions on Iran. In January, as his likely Republican primary competitors Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio warned of the threat of a nuclear Iran, Paul appeared skeptical. \u201cAre you ready to send ground troops to Iran?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you ready to bomb them? Are you ready to send 100,000 troops? I\u2019m a big fan of trying to exert and trying the diplomatic option as long as we can. If it fails, I will vote to resume sanctions and I would vote to have new sanctions\u2026 But if you do it in the middle of negotiations, you\u2019re ruining it.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s position on Iran has always been closer to Obama\u2019s than to that of his fellow Senate Republicans\u2014until March 9, when he joined 47 of his fellow Senate Republicans in signing the letter.\n\n\u201cThis is more than a flip-flop. This is a backflip,\u201d Justin Raimondo, the editorial director of Antiwar.com, told me on Wednesday. \u201cThis was the last straw. I\u2019ve put up with a lot from that guy! I\u2019ve had to defend him like a Jesuit. I\u2019m done. Let somebody else do it.\u201d\n\nTo say Raimondo was a supporter of Paul wouldn\u2019t quite be correct. Raimondo has acted like Paul\u2019s personal bodyguard on the Internet. More often than not, any comment that could be perceived as being remotely critical of the senator was met with a response from Raimondo that was so vitriolic it veered toward cyber-bullying. (When I wrote an article in July making the case that Ron Paul might pose a political problem for Rand Paul, Raimondo called me a \u201cprofessional sleaze-ologist.\u201d Other times when he was unhappy with my coverage of Paul, he criticized my appearance.)\n\nNow Raimondo acknowledges that he was much like many of the other Paul supporters I\u2019ve spoken to: not entirely satisfied with the senator but willing to tolerate him if it meant hearing some of what Raimondo believed expressed on the national stage. \u201cI thought he was going to start a real debate about foreign policy in this country, and I thought he was a reasonably principled yet pragmatic politician,\u201d Raimondo said. \u201cAnd now, apparently he\u2019s just a panderer who would do anything to please people who hate him anyway and will continue to hate him no matter what he does\u2014even if he changes his last name.\u201d\n\nRaimondo said he believes the rarified confines of the Senate and the media spotlight Paul has been cooking under have made him lose touch with reality. \u201cHe is taking his base for granted,\u201d Raimondo complained. \u201cHere is somebody who is an eye doctor who is suddenly elevated to the Senate. It\u2019s turned him into kind of a megalomaniac.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s counting on the organizational muscle of the Ron Paul groups like the Campaign for Liberty [and] Young Americans for Liberty\u2014but these are libertarians! They don\u2019t take orders from the central committee! It\u2019s like herding cats anyway,\u201d Raimondo said.\n\nThe senator claimed he signed the letter to help Obama position himself better during negotiations and to reinforce his position that Congress should have the final say over whether such an agreement with Iran is made. (Paul is a co-sponsor of the so-called Corker bill, which would give Congress the opportunity to vote on the matter.) Paul\u2019s explanation, of course, ignores Cotton\u2019s stated objectives: to kill those negotiations; and to remind the Obama administration that what it does doesn\u2019t matter, because when a new, Republican administration struts into office, it will just undo it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s curious,\u201d Christopher Preble, the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said of Paul\u2019s decision. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain level of disappointment and surprise,\u201d he said, but \u201cit\u2019s not unique to libertarians.\u201d The letter as a whole \u201creveals within the party kind of a departure of the wise and prudent foreign policy of, say, the George Bush 41 administration.\u201d (Paul often cites George H.W. Bush as a major inspiration for his own foreign policy.) Overall, Preblo said, the Iran letter is \u201cjust sort of embarrassing.\u201d\n\nRaimondo suggested that Paul\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t just vaguely related to 2016 but to the support of one influential donor in particular: \u201cI don\u2019t want to imply anything,\u201d he said, but, \u201cprior to this, he did meet with Sheldon Adelson\u2026\u201d\n\nOn March 4, Paul had a private meeting with the Las Vegas-based casino billionaire, who was visiting Washington to attend the congressional address by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, of whom Adelson is a fervent supporter. Adelson\u2019s hobby is toying with presidential politics: During the 2012 election, he spent $93 million on super PACs. His financial backing is so vital that he once got the tough-talking Chris Christie to apologize for offending him at a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition. (The New Jersey governor had referred to \u201cthe occupied territories,\u201d a widely used term for the Palestinian areas of the West Bank that are under Israeli control but one that Adelson finds offensive.) It was not helpful to Paul when The New York Times reported that Adelson was so turned off by Paul\u2019s foreign policy views that he told his associates he might finance a campaign to defeat Paul if the senator catches fire in the Republican primaries. After the early March meeting, Paul assured a Jewish radio program that rumors of Adelson\u2019s hatred of him were untrue.\n\nI asked Doug Stafford, a senior adviser to Paul, whether the meeting with Adelson had any impact on Paul\u2019s decision to sign the letter five days later. \u201cNo,\u201d Stafford insisted. \u201cWhat impacted his decision to sign the letter was he felt it reinforced his co-sponsorship of the Corker bill.\u201d\n\nStafford maintained that Paul hadn\u2019t flip-flopped or back-flipped. \u201cRand\u2019s foreign policy doesn\u2019t fit in boxes,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to label him as something, people want to put him in boxes, they try to assign these things. He just doesn\u2019t fit them.\u201d\n\nJack Hunter, a reliable Paul defender and co-author of his first book, told me: \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with him signing the letter. I guess he has his reasons.\u201d He acknowledged the letter was \u201cperhaps\u201d a departure from the senator\u2019s pro-negotiation position.\n\nWhatever nonsensical thing Paul may say about why he signed the letter, it\u2019s probably true that neglecting to do so would have had serious repercussions in the Republican presidential primary campaign. \u201cIt would be very difficult for any of the candidates to avoid signing onto it,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a Republican consultant. \u201cEven somebody like Paul, who knows his dad\u2019s lists are still going to fund a lot of his operation,\u201d Wilson said, knows \u201cit\u2019s a political reality that no one in the Republican Party right now is going to bless\u201d the Obama administration\u2019s position on Iran. Wilson said the debate over the letter would soon pass. \u201cI think the brouhaha is completely centered in the Acela corridor. It\u2019s a media frenzy. This is a D.C.-New York bullshit, circle-jerk process story.\u201d\n\nBullshit or not, it feels like the Nevada Libertarians were onto something back in January when they warned that Paul\u2019s shape-shifting positions, often too subtle to be branded flip-flopping but nonetheless unsettling to hardcore supporters, would ultimately nudge his libertarian base into a depressive state. \u201cIt sounds reasonable [to compromise] in order to win,\u201d said Jason Weinman, the party\u2019s outreach director. \u201cBut if you\u2019re compromising and then you\u2019re going to lose anyway, why are you compromising to begin with? Then you lose your whole base.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:45.965+0000"}
{"entityId": 1834, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Majorities disapprove of Obama\u2019s immigration move and still see Democrats as being against them. And most Democrats still don\u2019t get it.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 upstairs-downstairs coalition is fraying. Just ask Sen. Chuck Schumer; he\u2019ll tell you. Last week, Schumer announced that the Democrats had lost touch with Middle America, and that Barack Obama\u2019s agenda was out of sync with middle-class needs and expectations. For Schumer\u2014the third-ranking Senate Democrat and his caucus\u2019s chief message-crafter\u2014to go on the record like that, things must really be bad. Apparently, 2016 is not shaping up as a Democratic slam dunk.\n\nAt the moment, the public\u2019s discontent is palpable. The numbers show an America disdainful of the President\u2019s signature achievements. Absolute majorities disapprove of Obama\u2019s unilateral move on immigration, as well as the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd Obama\u2019s slide is having repercussions. Hillary Clinton now polls under 50 percent when pitted against all prospective Republican challengers, including firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz, and is tied in head-to-head matchups with Mitt Romney and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nOn one level, Schumer\u2019s analysis was granular. He argued that Obama wrongly rammed Obamacare through Congress, despite the fact that most Americans cared more about jobs and wages than about healthcare in the midst of the Great Recession. According to Schumer, Obama and his administration had misinterpreted their 2008 electoral mandate. New York\u2019s senior senator also pegged the ACA as the political equivalent of a fool\u2019s errand, noting that \u201conly a third of the uninsured are even registered to vote . . . only 5% of the electorate.\u201d\n\nFor the Democrats to win as the Government Party, activist government must demonstrate that it both works and is trustworthy.\n\nOn another level Schumer went large, and drew a critical distinction between the two parties. He owned up to the fact that the Democrats were the Government Party. Yet, this may prove to be the Democrats\u2019 bigger problem as they attempt to get out from under November\u2019s wreckage. For the Democrats to win as the Government Party, activist government must demonstrate that it both works and is trustworthy.\n\nRight now, however, government is perceived as failing on both scores. The rollout of Obamacare was a disaster, and the President\u2019s promise that if you liked your insurance you could keep it was false from the start. To top it off, it now turns out Jonathan Gruber, an Obamacare architect, was busy deriding Americans as stupid, even while pushing for cuts to healthcare for the elderly and glomming millions of dollars from government contracts.\n\nBut these days, government doesn\u2019t just seem untrustworthy; it looks downright malevolent to many. Remember Lois Lerner? The missing and presumed destroyed Internal Revenue Service emails have finally been recovered\u2014about 30,000 emails to be exact\u2014no thanks to the IRS. Even worse for fans of activist government, taxpayer information may have been shared by the taxman with the White House. Not surprisingly, Schumer, who also sits on the Senate Finance Committee, which has direct jurisdiction over the IRS, has had little to say about the IRS having gone rogue, other than to have earlier goaded the IRS to go after the Tea Party.\n\nThe reality is that federal civil servants act like Democratic Party adjuncts, and so trust in government won\u2019t come easy anytime soon. Department of Justice and IRS employees collectively donated nearly $140,000 to Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns. On the other hand, Mitt Romney netted approximately $28,000 from both DOJ and IRS employees, and McCain cobbled together little more than a paltry $5,200. By contrast, in 2012, the military vote split down the middle between Obama and Romney, according to exit polls.\n\nIf the Democrats are to get to past the Republican takeover of the Senate, they will need to again start talking about jobs, wages, and upward mobility; get beyond the politics of grievance and identity, and reach out to middle-income voters who are not public employees. That task, however, is easier said than done, with the culture gap underlying both parties\u2019 strategies of capturing an electoral majority.\n\nFor the Democrats, George McGovern\u2019s Coalition of the Ascendant has supplanted FDR\u2019s New Deal Coalition. The Democrats have gone from a party of Southern whites, urban ethnics, and minorities to a high-end-low-end amalgam of coastal and cultural elites sitting atop of a minority base, with the former providing the cash that drives campaigns and the latter bloc providing the votes. In the process, the Democrats have become more diverse, but also less tied to middle-income voters. Indeed, a majority of Democratic voters will be minority voters shortly after the next census is taken.\n\nAs the 2010 and 2014 midterms showed, the Democrats\u2019 strategy has is limits. Young voters, single women, and minorities may be enough to get a Democrat elected and re-elected as president, but they are an insufficient by themselves to act as an effective governing bloc. The rest of America matters, particularly when the rest of America is expected to pick up the tab for the Democrats\u2019 wish-list.\n\nFor the moment, Schumer is being treated as a truth-teller. One thing he\u2019s not, though, is a profile in courage or another Daniel Patrick Moynihan, New York\u2019s late senator and former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Back in the day, Moynihan was a candid critic of the Health Security Act or Hillarycare, the brainchild of the then-First Lady and 2016 Democratic frontrunner.\n\nIn early 1994, Moynihan observed, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a health care crisis in America. We have a welfare crisis.\u201d Moynihan also noted that \u201canyone who thinks [the Clinton health care plan] can work in the real world as presently written isn\u2019t living in it.\u201d The Clintons paid little mind to Moynihan\u2019s take on things. By the end of that year, Hillarycare was history, and the Republicans had recaptured the Congress. Schumer should have spoken up much sooner.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:46.419+0000"}

At a rally for over 700 people in the town of Independence, the Ohio governor said of his New Jersey counterpart that, \u201camong all the governors, he\u2019s my best friend.\u201d The audience let out a collective \u201cawww.\u201d The two were shown the next day on the front of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, shoulder-to-shoulder, beaming.\n\nA few weeks later, Christie was back in the Midwest, this time campaigning for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who was locked in a tight re-election battle.\n\nThis time though, the reaction was more \u201cooooooh,\u201d rather than \u201cawwww.\u201d\n\n\u201cChris is coming because he asked if he could come,\u201d Walker said when asked about the visit. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to say no. We\u2019re not looking for surrogates.\u201d\n\nThe Republican race for the GOP nomination is in its earliest days. And for the most part, the candidates have observed Ronald Reagan\u2019s 11th Commandment: \u201cThou Shall Not Speak Ill of Any Republican.\u201d\n\nThat is, except for Walker.\n\nFour days after winning re-election last November, Walker took shots at Kasich, who had bucked conservative orthodoxy by pushing through a Medicaid expansion, citing St. Peter and his Christian faith.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not fair to ask the son of a preacher to use biblical metaphors. My reading of the Bible finds plenty of reminders that it\u2019s better to teach someone to fish than to give them fish if they\u2019re able,\u201d Walker said at the time. \u201cCaring for the poor isn\u2019t the same as taking money from the federal government to lock more people into Medicaid.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans see Walker\u2019s willingness to throw elbows as the natural outgrowth of someone who has been climbing up the greasy political pole since he was 22, first as an assemblyman, then as Milwaukee County executive and governor.\n\nWalker has been busy tossing these types of bricks for a while now. When asked about Jeb Bush, for example, he told a New Hampshire interviewer, \u201cTo beat a name from the past, we need a name from the future.\u201d At CPAC, Walker told the crowd how he, \u201cthe son of a small-town preacher,\u201d visited Independence Hall in Philadelphia as an adult because he never had a chance to go as a kid. \u201cThat was a double-knock on Bush, the son and brother of former presidents, who once chaired the National Constitution Center\u2014down the street from Independence Hall,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\nIn fact, Walker has been knocking his fellow Republicans for years. During the 2012 campaign, he regularly criticized Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign, saying that Romney was too cautious and needed to show \u201cfire in the belly.\u201d Back in 2013, he was publicly suggesting that the next Republican nominee should be a governor before Congressman Paul Ryan, his fellow Wisconsinite and Romney\u2019s running mate, had announced whether he would run.\n\nAs his polls showed his own re-election a toss-up, Walker and his allies went public with criticism that the Republican Governors Association was failing to send enough donations to Wisconsin\u2014even though the RGA, which Christie chaired, had spent $8 million on his re-election, on top of nearly $9 million the group had spent two years before to help him fend off a recall.\n\n\u201c[Walker] is always in campaign mode\u2014always,\u201d said one Ohio Republican political operative, who added that some Walker allies were reaching out to political operatives in Ohio even before the midterms were over.\n\nAn aide to another Republican governor said, \u201cThe Republican class of governors in 2010, I always felt like we were already pretty much working together and on the same team. Walker seemed to view everybody else as a potential adversary.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans see Walker\u2019s willingness to throw elbows as the natural outgrowth of someone who has been climbing up the greasy political pole since he was 22, first as an assemblyman, then as Milwaukee County executive and governor.\n\n\u201cHe is an aggressive politician, I don\u2019t think there is any doubt about that,\u201d said Jeff Mayers, editor of WisPolitics.com, which covers the state\u2019s political scene. \u201cIf there is an opening, he is not afraid to go in there and fill it.\u201d\n\nMayers said he noted a shift in Walker after he prevailed in his fight with the public-sector unions and then became the first governor in history to survive a recall. Those battles, he said, \u201chardened his edge. He has always been aggressive, but I think he saw then that he could succeed without getting much more than 50 percent of the vote.\u201d\n\nBut other Wisconsin politicos say that Walker has long operated at his own political speed.\n\nDavid Riemer ran against Walker when he sought re-election as Milwaukee County executive in 2004. In that race, the Walker campaign ran ads accusing Riemer of engineering a city pension settlement that cost taxpayers millions of dollars. The pension settlement actually saved the county some $20 million, Riemer said, a fact that the city comptroller and city attorney backed up. According to a newspaper account at the time, Walker refused to pull the spots, even as \u201che again conceded that the ad\u2019s assertion is not correct as stated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of person admits that they are wrong but won\u2019t change what they are doing,\u201d asked Riemer when reached by phone this week. \u201cHis main goal has been to get into higher office and then use that to get into even higher office.\u201d\n\nOther candidates have much been more hesitant to go on the attack. When Jeb Bush was asked, for example, about Walker\u2019s recent flip-flops on immigration, he deflected and deflected until reporters followed him out of a campaign stop and told him that Walker had admitted changing his opinion on the issue.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s changed his views on immigration, yes,\u201d Bush, said, concurring with Walker\u2019s own opinion.\n\nWhen Marco Rubio was asked about Bush, he declined to criticize him, calling him \u201ca very credible candidate\u201d and praising his fundraising abilities. When Rand Paul entered the presidential race, Ted Cruz called him \u201ca good friend\u201d whose entry into the race will \u201chelp make us all stronger.\u201d Mike Huckabee is on the record with high praise for Rick Perry and one-time candidate Mitt Romney.\n\nIf any of the GOP contenders seem willing to push back Walker\u2019s comments so far, it is Kasich, who, while he may not be the son of a preacher like Walker, wanted to be a priest when he was a boy and whose parents were killed in car accident by a drunk driver in 1987. Often in profiles, Kasich is portrayed as growing most animated when he is compared to the Midwestern governor, who has shot far ahead of him in early state polls.\n\nWhen, for example, a New York Times reporter mentioned that many people think Walker is more conservative, Kasich \u201cbolted upright. \u2018I think I have the right to define what conservatism is,\u2019\u201d he roared, launching an 11-minute defense of his record. And days after Walker\u2019s biblical comments, Kasich tore into Walker while on stage beside him at an RGA event in Washington, D.C.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much all of this matters, whether Walker will have a head start in defining his rivals or whether he will be seen as a petulant elbow-thrower.\n\nIf his rivals don\u2019t like it, though, Dave Carney, a former adviser to Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich, said they should \u201cbuy a helmet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the amount of money in this primary, we aren\u2019t going to just see elbows being thrown but knees, fists, and probably ballistic missiles at some point,\u201d he said.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:48.303+0000"}
{"entityId": 1837, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Why the Donald\u2019s comments about John McCain\u2019s war record are unlikely to sink him.\n\nThe conventional wisdom of course is that Trump cooked his goose with that John McCain comment, and every so often the c.w. turns out to be right, as it might in this case. Republican base voters love their war heroes, provided they didn\u2019t come home and oppose the war and throw their medal over a fence, in which case it\u2019s OK to lie about them and smear their reputation; otherwise it\u2019s always been kind of an accepted chestnut that you don\u2019t talk smack about the military to Republicans.\n\nSo maybe he stepped in the quicksand here. But I think it\u2019s worth wondering: What if he didn\u2019t? What if, that is, he doesn\u2019t plummet in the polls? What if the near-universal presumption in the political media that this is the beginning of the end winds up being more about media presumptions about how the GOP base thinks than, you know, how that base actually thinks? I believe there\u2019s a sporting enough chance that this is the case that it\u2019s certainly worth a column, so here I go.\n\nLet\u2019s start here. What\u2019s brought Trump to the top of the GOP heap? Obviously, it\u2019s his relentless and unhinged caterwauling about immigration. Some punditry I\u2019ve noticed has tried to sugarcoat this, or note Trump\u2019s universal name recognition. But he had universal name recognition when he was at 5 percent. Two weeks of talk about Mexican rapists and this alleged plot of the Mexican government to \u201csend us\u201d all their criminals has vaulted him to the top of the Republican field. As I write this, in fact, the new ABC/Washington Post poll , which was taken Thursday through Sunday, has Trump with 24 percent of the vote, compared to 13 percent for Walker and 12 percent for Bush.\n\nThere is no mystery here. Conservative Republican base voters hate undocumented immigration as much as they hate anything. So many hot buttons get pushed. So Trump couldn\u2019t have chosen a better issue. But it hasn\u2019t been just the issue; it\u2019s the blunt way he talks about it. Because he is being so flagrantly and (to the base\u2019s eyes) delightfully anti-politically correct. He\u2019s rubbing the shit in everybody\u2019s face, right up into their nostrils. They love this.\n\nSo that\u2019s that. But now this primal urge collides head on with another one, the deep pro-military bias among these kinds of voters. This ardor is longer held, and it is more easily and widely understood by, oh, political reporters, for example. But is it definitely stronger than the anti-immigrant ardor?\n\nThe answer is, we don\u2019t know. I would argue that fear and loathing are generally better motivators in politics than love and enthusiasm, so I\u2019d say yes, anti-immigrant anger probably trumps, so to speak, pro-military passion.\n\nSo here\u2019s my prediction, and if I\u2019m wrong, it won\u2019t be the first time or the last, but: I think Trump will lose about three points over this.\n\nBut let\u2019s say I\u2019m wrong about that for the sake of argument. Even so, the assumption that Trump\u2019s comment will kill him itself seems to rest on an assumption: that pro-military passion equals and is indistinguishable from pro-John McCain fervor. And that is what I\u2019m not sure is the case at all.\n\nNow, it might be the case that because of Trump\u2019s exact phrasing (\u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured\u201d) his statement can be universalized from McCain to every veteran who was captured. If it plays out like that, maybe Trump has big problems. But if this is just a Trump vs. McCain thing, it\u2019s not hard to see how Trump could skate through.\n\nFirst of all, McCain is yesterday\u2019s news. He\u2019s a month away from turning 80. He\u2019s certainly still relevant as a senator, but that isn\u2019t the question. The question is whether an attack on him incites the GOP base to rise up in his defense. A very open question. Remember, the base voters didn\u2019t like him much in 2008. He had to put Sarah Palin on his ticket to assuage them.\n\nIf Trump had disparaged Iraq war veterans as a group, or the U.S. military as a thing, then sure, he\u2019d probably be cooked. But that isn\u2019t what he did. He mocked a particular human being\u2014and, at that, a human being whose relationship to the base is complicated. Even now, McCain is already facing a declared primary challenge, assuming he seeks reelection in 2016, from a right-wing state senator who wants you to join her in \u201cnot just go[ing] along with the Beltway crowd.\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s my prediction, and if I\u2019m wrong, it won\u2019t be the first time or the last, but: I think Trump will lose about three points over this. And I think even that small diminution will happen less because \u201che attacked a war hero\u201d than because \u201che\u2019s an out-of-control person who really just isn\u2019t the kind of guy who ought to be a major-party presidential nominee.\u201d He is of course going to say more crazy things along these crazy lines, and eventually, as I\u2019ve written before, his act is going to get tired.\n\nBut I say it\u2019s going to take more than this for Trump to fall. The press underestimates the intensity of the conservative base\u2019s feelings on immigration, and it always has. Why isn\u2019t immigration reform law, after 68 senators voted for it (including 14 Republicans) in 2013, and given that we know almost to a certainty that it could have passed the House any day that John Boehner might have chosen to let it come to a vote? The answer: It isn\u2019t law because of the GOP base, period. The Judases who voted for it would all have received primary challenges, and Boehner would have been dumped as speaker.\n\nThe lessons here go beyond Trump. A poll of Latinos came out last week that was just terrible for Republicans. The strongest Republican against Hillary Clinton? Jeb Bush (yep, more than Marco Rubio, by a couple points). But let\u2019s make that \u201cstrongest,\u201d with irony quotes, because Jeb\u2019s number was 27 percent, which is exactly what Mitt Romney got in 2012.\n\nSo nothing in the GOP has changed, and Bush can speak Spanish exclusively for the next few months, and very little is going to change. The GOP\u2019s larger problem, then, isn\u2019t Trump. It\u2019s the people supporting him.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:48.551+0000"}

No, it\u2019s not an ancient curse\u2014it\u2019s the sound of the GOP\u2019s play-it-safers rallying the party faithful to the host city of the 2016 Republican National Convention.\n\nThere\u2019s an endless supply of anti-Cleveland jokes to choose from, so in one sense, Republicans have little to risk in prompting a couple more. But a party\u2019s choice of convention city rarely, if ever, moves the electoral needle, so let\u2019s not pretend this is all about winning Ohio.\n\nCleveland is indeed emblematic of the right\u2019s mainstream, only in all the wrong ways. It\u2019s a choice that hands the pom poms to those who deny that their party or their country needs fundamental change. And it especially strengthens those who look to meet massive challenges with little more than small-scale policy tinkering.\n\nIn that sense, the city of Cleveland makes a perfect setting for the marriage of establishmentarians and the wonky reformocons, the group of rising conservative policy intellectuals who advocate for a more appealing and wonky GOP.\n\nConfronting a Tea Party insurgency on the one hand and a libertarian moment on the other, the party\u2019s insiders need to prove they have a vision to govern. The respectable reformers, meanwhile, know how rare a chance 2016 is to decisively shape our national affairs. If Republicans lose the presidency again, the overhaul to come will leave a lot of white papers on the ash heap of electoral history.\n\nThere\u2019s much to be said for the great diligence and discernment the reformocons bring to their task. Unfortunately, they depend for their political relevance on figures the GOP would do well to put in their rear view, or at least in their rear guard.\n\nAnd just those establishmentarians are lining up to shower canned praise on Cleveland, a city that Americans from all regions have come to recognize for what it is.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited,\u201d GOP Chairman Reince Priebus says of Cleveland. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a city that\u2019s on the rise.\u201d\n\nFor Speaker John Boehner, the path to the White House \u201cwill start and end in Ohio.\u201d\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich, who abandoned his right-wing bona fides by fully embracing president Obama\u2019s Medicaid expansion, positively touts the ideological significance of the Cleveland pick. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to tell the country\u201d that \u201cwe have the right formula for helping the country,\u201d he raves. \u201cWe\u2019ve used it in Ohio, it works, now we can tell the country that what we do here works.\u201d\n\nFinally, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman\u2014the Romney-approved Bush-era insider who\u2019s floating a run of his own in \u201916\u2014calls the convention \u201ca unique opportunity to showcase the new Cleveland as one of America\u2019s great cities.\u201d\n\nThe establishment game plan is clear. It\u2019s not like Cleveland rocks. With apologies to William Ross Wallace, it\u2019s more like the hand that rocks the Cleveland is the hand that rules the world.\n\nSome might say Cleveland can never be as important as all that. A sitting senator, for instance, might be forgiven any enthusiasm for successfully lobbying his party\u2019s convention into his backyard. At the same time, it\u2019s not altogether clear that such a lenient and casual attitude will reward Republicans on the road to 2016. In fact, Portman himself is a striking example of why the opposite is more likely.\n\nConfronting a Tea Party insurgency on the one hand and a libertarian moment on the other, the party\u2019s insiders need to prove they have a vision to govern.\n\nCall it the new class, the crony class, the ruling class, or the lobbyist-industrial complex. Call it what you will. Its members\u2014whatever their party, whatever their morals, and whatever their taste for finely-reasoned policymaking\u2014are recognizable by their resumes. In Portman\u2019s case, his time as W.\u2019s budget director and his stint as a Patton Boggs heavyweight say far more to Americans than his invocations of \u201cthe heartland\u201d and \u201cthe party of ideas.\u201d\n\nRather than a yeoman or a political theorist, Portman is an operator\u2014a member of the political elite who understands the way policy chops can work as politics by other means: Win on \u201cresponsibility,\u201d win on \u201ccredibility,\u201d win on \u201csubstance,\u201d and then you get a shot at pulling away the scare quotes.\n\nYet the mood of the country is leading Americans away from the idea that these trust signifiers are to be trusted. Americans are starting to wonder if they\u2019re even usable anymore. Which is more responsible: too big to fail, or auditing the Fed? Which is more credible: calling for economic growth above 5 percent, or calling for an end to the Department of Homeland Security? Which is more substantive: chained CPI, or criminal justice reform?\n\nA good operator, of course, can change to accommodate the times. Paul Ryan, mainline wonk extraordinaire, has already shown a willingness to walk the walk on poverty reduction and minority outreach. It is another question, however, whether the times will change to accommodate its operators.\n\nMost Republicans blanch instinctively at the political rhetoric of \u201cthe new Cleveland.\u201d Many Americans will have the same reaction if the champions of the new Cleveland roll out \u201cthe new GOP.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:49.017+0000"}
{"entityId": 1839, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Warren hits Obama on Wall Street. Christie tells the right they\u2019ll have to live with him as is. Wish Clinton had a little of that moxie.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that despite the obstacle of Bridgegate on the one hand and the Hillary juggernaut on the other, rank-and-file voters across parties remain energized by the prospect of either Chris Christie or Elizabeth Warren running for president. In an era of politicians who are too cautious to take a bold stand on much of anything except for when it comes to the hyperbole of bashing the other party, Christie and Warren seem to be actual human beings\u2014most importantly, ones with actual convictions that they\u2019re willing to stand up for, even if it means standing against their own parties. The contrast is even more stark in the context of Hillary Clinton: Elizabeth Warren has populist policies, Chris Christie a populist personality, but Hillary Clinton has neither.\n\nIn a recent interview with Salon, Warren doubled down on her criticism of President Obama for letting Wall Street off the hook in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. After Wall Street reckless crashed the entire United States economy, costing millions of Americans their jobs, homes, and savings, the Obama Administration put forward only modest financial reform laws and didn\u2019t prosecute a single culpable bank executive.\n\n\u201c[W]hen the going got tough, his economic team picked Wall Street,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThey protected Wall Street. Not families who were losing their homes. Not people who lost their jobs. Not young people who were struggling to get an education. And it happened over and over and over.\u201d\n\nWarren echoed criticism she lobbed at President Obama in her book, A Fighting Chance, in which she cited Obama\u2019s lack of action on comprehensive financial reform as a significant \u201clost opportunity\u201d to hold Wall Street accountable and fix the structures of our economy to make it work for the middle class.\n\nMeanwhile, The New York Times published a story about Chris Christie\u2019s awkward courtship of evangelical Republicans. Christie actually siding with the Religious Right on a number of fundamental issues is somehow insufficient, the article accounts: \u201cAlthough they are drawn to Mr. Christie\u2019s bumptious style, and believe that his opposition to abortion, their chief priority, is deep-seated, they feel he has crossed them on pivotal issues and at key moments.\u201d\n\nIn other words, although anyone markedly more socially conservative than Christie stands no realistic chance of being elected President of the United States of America as the electorate becomes even more socially liberal, the right of the right is so damned determined to police the borders of its increasingly irrelevant influence that it is eschewing Christie for not being right wing enough.\n\nChristie\u2019s attitude? According to the Times, \u201cAsked about the depth of his conservatism this spring, Mr. Christie replied, \u2018I just act like myself and people take it or leave it, and I\u2019m completely content with that.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s the sort of attitude that, I\u2019ll confess, makes Christie hard to dislike\u2014in spite of all his anti-teacher, anti-gay, anti-woman policies. And it\u2019s the sort of attitude that has allowed him even still be toying with the presidency despite a year of seemingly disqualifying bad headlines.\n\nContrast both Warren and Christie with Clinton, the heir-apparent to the presidency as far as all the polls (PDF) so far are concerned. Clinton is cautious politically\u2014trying, for instance, in her rhetoric to nod to the economic populism of the day while maintaining her allegiances to Wall Street. Or talking tough on foreign policy while trying to obscure the depths of a pro-war hawkishness for which voters simply don\u2019t have an appetite.\n\nEvery sentence Clinton produces seems like a dehydrated piece of fruit that\u2019s then been chewed up and spit out by three focus groups.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t help that Clinton is also stylistically cautious\u2014that every sentence she produces seems like a dehydrated piece of fruit that\u2019s then been chewed up and spit out by three focus groups before being spoon fed in its final bland and listless form to the American public. Sure, it\u2019s easy to get excited about the idea of Hillary Clinton\u2014pioneering political figure who would break the ultimate glass ceiling if elected. But Hillary Clinton herself just ain\u2019t exciting.\n\nThe tide of politics would seem to be leaving a Clinton-type behind as we as a nation become more hyper-partisan and simultaneously more fixated on big personality-driven characters, from real housewives to TV anchors to the candidates for whom we vote. And yet just like Mitt Romney survived (for a while) by being the last guy standing, Clinton may win out through simple endurance in spite of all her counter-cultural downsides. Then again, Mitt Romney\u2019s primary opponents were perhaps a uniquely unqualified group of self-destructive yahoos.\n\nChristie and Warren are real threats to Clinton both in real political terms, as potential opponents, but also conceptually in that their political talent spotlights Clinton\u2019s deficiency. Odds are that Warren won\u2019t run in 2016, but that she will wisely use the enthusiasm around her gift for authentically connecting with the populist outrage of voters to push an agenda with both Obama and Clinton, hopefully successfully nudging both further to the left\u2014away from big business and Wall Street and toward middle class accountability.\n\nOn the other hand, Chris Christie will probably run\u2014and the fact is that if he manages to survive the Republican primary process, even though the majority of American would side with Hillary Clinton especially on social policy (Christie is indeed far to the right of most voters), he would still pose a significant challenge because of his more winning personality. Without any real challengers, Clinton may be able to pull off looking populist and popular enough\u2014but when the race gears up, the strengths of other candidates will simply emphasize her weaknesses.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:49.514+0000"}

It\u2019s a bold, politically risky move with the potential to change the debate forever.\n\nIndiana is in the midst of a horrific spike in HIV cases\u201479 cases have been recorded in one county alone\u2014and Governor Mike Pence is breaking with party tradition in his search for a solution. He has announced that the state will initiate an HIV and substance abuse treatment center that will include a short-term needle exchange program \u201cfor the sole purpose of containing the epidemic.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s decision to sanction a short-term needle-exchange program is a major step forward in drug reform\u2014and not just for the Hoosier State. Support from Pence, the former congressman and staunch conservative, could mean the tipping point in a debate that\u2019s plagued the U.S. for two decades.\n\n\u201cThese services are meant to keep people alive.\u201d\n\nDespite mounting scientific evidence that needle exchange programs are effective at reducing HIV among drug users, the federal ban on funding has been in place since 1980. If Pence can help sway others in his party to support the issue, there\u2019s a good chance the ban may be lifted all together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting. Great to show Gov. Pence showing leadership on this,\u201d Bill Piper, director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, told The Daily Beast. \u201cHis actions stand out as being more influential\u2014he has the ability to influence others.\u201d\n\nAt present, Pence\u2019s plan only allows the needle exchange to remain open for 30 days. If prior studies are any indication, Pence may want to extend it.\n\nExperts estimate that IV drug use accounts for 14 percent of cases of HIV among women and up to 11 percent among men\u2014an epidemic that newly infects 50,000 Americans every year. Needles, used to inject drugs into the bloodstream, make an ideal vehicle for HIV. The blood-borne infection can cling either to the needle itself or the drug inside of it. The result puts the 15.9 million people who inject drugs worldwide, 3 million of whom already have it, at great risk of infection.\n\nBut there is a simple remedy: clean needles.\n\nThe first federally funded evaluation of the efficacy of needle-exchange programs took place in New Haven, Connecticut, in late 1998. Using mathematical and statistical data (rather than self-reporting), the researchers found a 33 percent drop in the rate of HIV infections among participants. Since then, more than four dozen studies have been released showing similar results.\n\nThe list of agencies that support the practice is extensive. It includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nBut still, the ban on federal funding for needle-exchange programs lives on. First introduced amid AIDS panic of the 1980s, it was repealed once in 2009 by Democrats, but then quickly reinstated when Republicans took the House in 2011.\n\nCritics of the ban argue that needle-exchange programs not only promote drug use, but increase the likelihood that people will use drugs. Science begs to differ. Multiple reports from the CDC and the National Institute on Drug Abuse have concluded that syringe exchange programs do not increase the incidence of drug use. In 2008, the Surgeon General released a statement confirming this.\n\nKaiser Health estimates that there are at least 221 sterile syringe exchange programs nationwide across 33 states. The programs themselves are simple, providing a place for users to dispose of contaminated needles and obtain sterile syringes for later use.\n\n\u201cNo one is going to run out and do heroin just because they have a syringe,\u201d Piper says. \u201cThe reality is people who are going to use heroin are going to use it.

But now Obama is promising to send in hundreds of special operations forces based on a written promise that these soldiers will not be tried in Iraq\u2019s famously compromised courts for actions they are taking in defense of Baghdad.\n\nThe U.S. military and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel have opposed sending any special operations teams to Iraq until there is a written agreement from Iraq\u2019s government that they will not be prosecuted under Iraqi law. On Monday, the White House spokesman said those promises were provided in an exchange of diplomatic notes. The delay in getting that agreement is one of many reasons why the Pentagon and the White House were reluctant to support air strikes inside Iraq\u2014despite lobbying from Secretary of State John Kerry and his aides.\n\n\u201cWe remain confident that the military advisers will have the protections they need,\u201d said Bernadette Meehan, a spokesperson for the National Security Council. \u201cThey are going to Iraq with the full support of the Iraqi government. We are working through the mechanism for assurances and we hope to [have it] resolved soon.\u201d\n\nThe debate has echoes of 2011, when then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton favored keeping more troops in Iraq past 2011 than President Obama.\n\nAccording to multiple administration officials involved in the process, senior members of the State Department have argued internally that limited U.S. air strikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) are needed\u2014along with more direct assistance to the Baghdad government\u2014to push back the terrorist group.\n\nIf air strikes are going to be effective, however, they would require at least some U.S. forces to provide the intelligence on what individuals, equipment, and buildings should be targeted. At least some of the 300 special operators Obama is sending to Iraq are supposed to prepare those assessments of ISIS\u2014as well as evaluate the Iraqi military and what kind of gaps in it U.S. assistance may address.\n\nBut for now, those units will be protected against potential prosecution based on the promise of a beleagured government that is almost certain to change as Iraq's parliament chooses a new prime minister, president and speaker. The risks for U.S. soldiers are potentially high. In January 2011, Pakistani authorities jailed Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor and former U.S. soldier, after he killed two individuals in Lahore. Davis ultimately escaped Pakistani justice. At the time, the Obama administration argued that Davis was covered under the same legal protections as U.S. diplomats.\n\nIn Iraq, no such diplomatic immunity is on offer for the special operations teams, according to U.S. officials briefed on the negotiations. These sources say the special operations forces being sent to Iraq would not be covered under the diplomatic immunity provided to U.S. military personnel still attached to the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.\n\nBack in 2011, when the United States tried to negotiate for several thousand U.S. military personnel to stay in Iraq past the end of that year, the White House demanded Iraq\u2019s parliament approve modifications to what is known as a status of forces agreement (SOFA) that included these kinds of legal protections. This month, Colin Kahl, the senior Pentagon official in charge of Iraq policy at the time, explained why the White House insisted on Iraq\u2019s parliament approving the changes to the SOFA.\n\nHe wrote in Politico Magazine that in 2011 Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, \u201ctold U.S. negotiators that he was willing to sign an executive memorandum of understanding that included these legal protections.\u201d\n\nBut Kahl added, \u201cFor any agreement to be binding under the Iraqi constitution, it had to be approved by the Iraqi parliament. This was the judgment of every senior administration lawyer and Maliki\u2019s own legal adviser, and no senior U.S. military commander made the case that we should leave forces behind without these protections.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are pursuing something in writing. The secretary is absolutely committed to making sure that our troops have the legal protections. He would not do that on a nod and a wink.\u201d\n\nSince that time, Iraq\u2019s courts have become even more politicized than they were before. As U.S. forces were preparing to leave the country in 2011, a court convicted Iraq\u2019s highest-ranking Sunni politician, the vice president, Tariq al-Hashemi, of orchestrating terrorism against his own government. Maliki eventually issued an arrest warrant for Hashemi, forcing him into exile. In 2012, an Iraqi court dropped all charges against Ali Musa Daqduq, a Hezbollah military planner that U.S. forces accused of orchestrating a string of five murders of U.S. servicemen in 2007 outside of Karbala. In 2013, Human Rights Watch accused Iraq\u2019s judicial system of systematically relying on coerced confessions for convictions in major terrorism cases.\n\nYet this time around, Obama is willing to accept an agreement from Iraq\u2019s foreign ministry on U.S. forces in Iraq without a vote of Iraq\u2019s parliament. \u201cWe believe we need a separate set of assurances from the Iraqis,\u201d one senior U.S. defense official told The Daily Beast on Sunday. This official said this would likely be an agreement or exchange of diplomatic notes from the Iraq\u2019s foreign ministry. \u201cWe basically need a piece of paper from them,\u201d another U.S. official involved in the negotiations told The Daily Beast. The official didn\u2019t explain why the parliamentary vote, so crucial three years ago, was no longer needed.\n\nOf course, part of the problem in 2014 is that the United States doesn\u2019t have the time to wait for Iraq\u2019s parliament. To start, the Iraqi parliament is in the process of forming a new government. The parliament would have to choose a new prime minister, parliamentary speaker and president before reopening the politically sensitive issue of approving legal protections for the military that occupied the country between 2003 and 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, there are other forces that are also stepping in to fill the void. Last week, Iraq\u2019s leading Shi\u2019ite religious authority, Ayatollah Ali Sistani, called on Iraqis to pick up arms and fight the Sunni insurgency led by ISIS. The last time Sunni extremists threatened Iraq, in 2006 and 2007, Sistani used his voice to urge calm.\n\nIraq\u2019s powerful neighbor, Iran, has also offered its full support to Maliki to fight ISIS with no political conditions on the embattled prime minister. President Obama, on the other hand, has hinted that the Iraqi government would need to include a wider coalition of political parties in order to receive more aid.\n\nThe desperation of Iraq\u2019s government has led some in Obama\u2019s government\u2014especially in the State Department\u2014to push for a stronger military response. \u201cBy not taking more aggressive action we\u2019re giving the ground to ISIS\u2014anything less than very aggressive at this point is a drop in the bucket,\u201d one administration official sympathetic to the State Department\u2019s argument said. \u201cWe have a government in Baghdad that wants our help. It\u2019s the best of bad options.\u201d\n\nKerry last week also made the case for limited air strikes. \u201cThey [drones] are not the whole answer, but they may well be one of the options that are important to be able to stem the tide and stop the movement of people who are moving around in open convoys and trucks and terrorizing people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have people murdering, assassinating in these mass massacres, you have to stop that and you do what you need to do if you need to try to stop it from the air or otherwise.\u201d\n\nOn Monday when Kerry arrived in Iraq for talks with Iraq's leaders, he urged them to form a new government that is inclusive of the country's Sunni minority population.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:50.587+0000"}
{"entityId": 1842, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "It\u2019s not just the GOP frontrunner\u2014menophobia, or the fear of menstrual blood, goes all the way back to biblical times.\n\nBy now we have all been caught up in #Bloodgate. Donald Trump\u2019s chauvinistic gaffe about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly menstruating has (slightly) damaged his reputation among Republicans, leading to retracted invitations and the implausible explanation that he was referring to her nose. \u201cI cherish women,\u201d Trump later added.\n\nAs archaic and crass as The Donald is, he\u2019s not the first to see menstruation as a drain on a woman\u2019s intellect. Just this week the Daily Mail censored a picture of London marathon runner Kiran Gandhi, who dared to \u201cfree flow\u201d during the competition. Many of us grew up on menstruation jokes, the punch line of which was \u2018never trust an animal that bleeds for five days and doesn\u2019t die.\u2019 This is not some modern Western hang-up: menophobia (the fear of menstrual blood) is a cross-cultural phenomenon. The sociologist Emile Durkheim actually hypothesized that religion developed as a partial response to the \u201crepulsing action\u201d of menstruation.\n\nIn the Jewish religious imagination, blame for what is actually the primordial \u201ccurse\u201d is often placed squarely on Eve. Eve is seen as responsible for all of the unpleasantness of the reproductive process: menstruation and childbirth included.\n\nIn the ritual regulations that make up the book of Leviticus, menstrual blood turns out to be something of a problem. According to the book\u2019s priestly author, menstruation is a cause of ritual impurity. Not only is a menstruating woman impure for seven days, but anyone who touches her is unclean \u201cuntil the evening\u201d (Lev. 15:19). Sex is squarely out of the question (unless you want to bring seven days of impurity on yourself) and, in the meantime, everything she sits or lies on also becomes unclean. The impurity associated with menstruation\u2014much like the impurity associated with skin diseases or emissions of semen\u2014was communicable through touch.\n\nThe prohibition on contact with menstruating women is not found only in Judaism. The Koran prohibits intercourse during menses (2:222) and the Hindu Laws of Manu indicate that a woman becomes purified from menstruation when she bathes at the conclusion of her period (6:66). Bathing post-period appears to have been the cross-cultural cure-all, but until menses were over women were contagious. Until 2005, Hindu women in Nepal were forced to live in cowsheds during their period. To this day some traditional members of Orthodox Christianity abstain from receiving Holy Communion during menstruation.\n\nBut this is about more than either cleanliness or ritual purity. The idea that menstrual blood poses a health risk is evident in a variety of cultures. The ancient Jewish collection of rabbinic opinions known as the Talmud reads, \u201cIf a menstruant woman passes between two [men], if it is at the beginning of her menses, she will slay one of them, and if it is at the end of her menses, she will cause strife between them\u201d (b. Pesah\u0323. 111a). Watch out, Chris Wallace and Brett Baier.\n\nTrump may not have been one of the Republican nominees who paraded their Christianity around the arena in Cleveland, but there is a religious basis to (this part of) his misogyny.\n\nThe Talmud reads, \u201cIf a menstruant woman passes between two [men], if it is at the beginning of her menses, she will slay one of them \u2026 at the end of her menses, she will cause strife between them.\u201d Watch out, Chris Wallace and Brett Baier.\n\nAnd all of this anxiety about women\u2019s reproductive cycles leaves aside the old wives\u2019 tales about how menstruating women shouldn\u2019t attend funerals, bake bread, or pickle vegetables.\n\nBut why do we obsess over a biological process experienced by the majority of (although not all) women?\n\nPart of it is to do with the way that menstrual blood reminds us that the human body is not hermetically sealed from the world around it. To an extent, as UNC-Charlotte anthropologist Jon Marks told me, \u201cAll bodily fluids are symbolically charged\u2014phlegm, urine, etc. Probably the symbolic ambiguity is that they are both part of you and not part of you simultaneously. Mucus, ear wax, saliva.\u201d At the same time though, \u201cBlood\u2026is sort of in a class by itself, because it indicates so much, from valor, essence, and ancestry to illness and infertility.\u201d\n\nThis is not to say that menstruation does not have its advantages, even in religious contexts. Menstruating women can be exempted from the fasting that accompanies Ramadan and, in some cultures, are encouraged to avoid work. In her book Blood Magic: The Anthropology of Menstruation, anthropologist Alma Gottlieb describes how among the Beng people of Cote d\u2019Ivoire, menstruating women are released from work in the fields and instead cook a special sweet palm-nut sauce. The fact that members of the community prize this particular dish suggests that menstruation is not naturally or necessarily taboo.\n\nPerhaps Trump will take solace in the knowledge that, while he\u2019s a throwback to an earlier, Pre-Enlightenment age, he\u2019s hardly alone in finding women\u2019s bodily discharges repulsive. And who knows, perhaps there\u2019s a business opportunity here. Trump Red Tents does have a nice ring to it.

And they have no answers.\n\nAfter spending the last few years talking about \u201cwar on women\u201d issues like abortion laws, equal pay, and contraception, and with commentators lampooning Republican efforts to appeal to female voters, it was expected that the 2014 midterm elections would come down to the \u201cgender gap,\u201d the difference between how men and women vote in the election.\n\nWell, the pundits were right: the political \u201cgender gap\u201d would decide the fate of candidates in the 2014 midterms. But the decisive point wasn\u2019t that Republicans have a female voter problem. It was that Democrats have a male voter problem.\n\nContrary to popular belief, women are not always a solidly Democratic voting bloc, though they do tend to break slightly more Democratic than men do. In the 2010 midterms, Republicans actually did slightly better than Democrats among female voters nationwide, winning 49 percent of their votes for Congress. But certainly in the last presidential election, in the wake of awful comments about rape and birth control from a small handful of absolute morons, it wasn\u2019t hard to paint the entire GOP as anti-woman.\n\n\u201cPlease, oppressors, bring your male privilege to the polls for us\u201d isn\u2019t exactly a message that wins you hearts and minds.\n\nDuring this election, Democrats doubled-down on the strategy of bludgeoning Republicans with \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d scare tactics. They were aided by the national controversy around this summer\u2019s Supreme Court ruling that allowed Hobby Lobby, a privately owned company, to opt out of providing employees with insurance coverage for some forms of contraception. They were energized by the emergence of a figure like Wendy Davis in Texas, who rose to national prominence following her filibuster over a law increasing regulations on abortion clinics and prohibiting abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nCandidates like Mark Udall in Colorado made these issues a centerpiece of their campaigns, if not the primary rationale for why the Republican ought not be elected. In the Colorado example, by the time election day rolled around, Udall\u2019s own donors were openly criticizing the campaign\u2019s decision to pound the \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d theme as the only real message he had. Meanwhile, his Republican opponent Cory Gardner had come out as vocally pro-contraception and was eager to move on to other topics.\n\nOn election day, Mark Udall did win female voters by an eight-point margin. But he lost male voters by 17 points.\n\nIt was a pattern repeated nationwide. In Iowa, Republican candidate for Senate Joni Ernst\u2014the first woman Iowa has ever sent to Washington as an elected representative\u2014tied her opponent, Democrat Bruce Braley, among female voters. She won men by 18 points. Or take, for instance, the unexpectedly non-competitive race in Georgia, where a Republican man defeated a Democratic woman; the Democratic candidate won female voters by eight percentage points but lost men by a staggering 23 points.\n\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way first: it wasn\u2019t about abortion. In Colorado, where a \u201cpersonhood\u201d amendment was on the ballot that would have dramatically restricted abortion and certain forms of contraception, it failed with 63 percent of men and 66 percent of women voting \u201cno\u201d\u2014hardly a \u201cgender gap\u201d to be found.\n\nNo, instead, it turns out that when your message is very clearly aimed at pandering to or terrifying one slice of voters, the rest of the electorate says \u201cno thanks.\u201d \u201cPlease, oppressors, bring your male privilege to the polls for us\u201d isn\u2019t exactly a message that wins you hearts and minds, no matter how many Lena Dunham appeals you make. And with men seeing wages stagnate and economic opportunity drying up, hammering home a message about the \u201cwar on women\u201d is tone-deaf at best.\n\nRepublicans definitely have work to do at ensuring they can compete with female voters. The prospect of running against a potential first female President of the United States in two years should keep Republicans vigilant about the need to speak to women and win their votes.\n\nThere are ways to do it well without being divisive: Democratic policies like the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which was sold with a promise that it would give women \u201cequal pay for equal work,\u201d have done nothing to close the wage gap during Obama\u2019s presidency, and Republicans should call Democrats out on how their policies have failed to deliver. The best thing for women\u2019s economic standing\u2014as well as men\u2019s\u2014is a growing economy, and the gap closed significantly more during the 1980s and early 1990\u2019s under Reagan and the first President Bush than under any modern Democratic president.\n\nDemocrats have, in their attempts to rally one group of voters, failed to win over women in a serious way but have sent men the message that men are the problem or their economic concerns don\u2019t really matter.\n\nThere\u2019s a gender gap in politics, for sure. But it backfired on Democrats in the midterms. And in the process, it sent the youngest woman ever to Congress (a Republican) and the first female Senators from Iowa and West Virginia (both Republicans).\n\nNot such a bad night for women after all.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:51.202+0000"}

Ironically, when Panetta was chairman of the House Budget Committee in the early 1990s, he took the exact opposite position and pushed for huge cuts to the defense budget.\n\nPanetta likes to present himself an \u201chonest,\u201d \u201cstraight-talking,\u201d aw-shucks kind of guy\u2014the son of Italian immigrants who has lived the American Dream. But in reality he is the quintessential example of how Washington corrupts.\n\nFor Panetta, principles appear to be determined by wherever he happens to be sitting at any given moment.\n\nHowever, his irresponsible threat-mongering and his constant stream of gaffes and misstatements (like the claim that the US was in Iraq because of 9/11 and that the war was worth it) masked a stunningly narrow and parochial foreign policy vision. It wasn\u2019t just that Panetta was saying crazy things. As his new memoir shows, he apparently believed them.\n\nTake, for example, Panetta\u2019s now oft-repeated position on troop withdrawals from Iraq in 2011, a move that as Secretary of Defense he praised but now three years later labels a failure. While Panetta acknowledges that the adamant refusal of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to maintain a troop presence in Iraq was a key impediment, he has a brilliant after-the-fact solution: the US should have just turned up the heat on Maliki.\n\nAccording to Panetta, the US could have simply said that we would withdraw both reconstruction and military aid to Iraq until Maliki bent to America\u2019s will. That Panetta thinks that threatening and demeaning the Iraqi leader was a worthy step to make in order to maintain a US force that the Iraqis clearly didn\u2019t want is remarkably short-sighted. Panetta seems utterly uninterested in the question of what happens if Maliki called the US bluff or, if he said yes, how would that affect the long-term relationship between the US and Iraq. For Panetta, the only thing that mattered in 2011 was maintaining a residual US military force in the country, which he says\u2014without much in the way of evidence\u2014would have helped prevent the rise of ISIS.\n\nPanetta is fond of such retrospective certainty. He asserts that if the US had backed Syrian rebels militarily it would have built up a moderate counter-weight to ISIS. He also labels the president\u2019s failure to use force against Syria when it crossed Obama\u2019s \u201credline\u201d and used chemical weapons against his own people a damaging \u201cblow to American credibility.\u201d According to Panetta, \u201cthe power of the United States rests on its word, and clear signals are important both to deter adventurism and to reassure allies that we can be counted on.\u201d The implication is that if the US had merely bombed Assad, those clear signals would have been sent and received by enemies and allies alike.\n\nOf less concern to Panetta are not only the potential negative consequences from using force but also the actual diplomatic agreement negotiated by the US to completely destroy all of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. While he gives a perfunctory nod to this \u201cimportant accomplishment\u201d in his memoir, he complains that \u201chesitation and half-steps have consequences.\u201d\n\nAs for what those specific consequences are, other than vague platitudes about credibility and signals: your guess is as good as mine. For Panetta, the act of using force is seemingly more important than the actual tangible result achieved by using force.\n\nNowhere is this mindset of war as a presentational tool more evident than Panetta\u2019s discussion of the 2009 surge in Afghanistan. While Panetta says the focus on the Taliban, rather than al Qaeda, was misplaced and he complains that the military actively tried to box in Obama on troop levels \u2026 he says that there was no reason for the decision on the surge to have taken so long.\n\n\u201cFor him to defy his military advisers on a matter so central to the success of his foreign policy and so early in his presidency would have represented an almost impossible risk,\u201d says Panetta. Translation: the surge was a bad idea, but the politics of national security demanded that Obama send American troops to fight a war that Panetta in his memoir calls \u201cnot a ringing success.\u201d\n\nIronically, in his public appearances Panetta has been forcefully stating that a commander-in-chief must keep all options on the table\u2014an implicit criticism of Obama\u2019s refusal to put troops on the ground to fight ISIS. But in Afghanistan, the one option that Panetta appears to believe we should not have had on the table was defying the military and not surging, which is nothing if not an interesting twist on the principle of civilian control of the military. For Panetta, \u201call options\u201d means only one thing\u2014use of force.\n\nHere, Panetta could not be more explicit. He says President Obama was a \u201cstrong leader on security issues\u201d in his first term and cites as evidence Obama\u2019s support for CIA military operations and the fact that he was \u201ctough on terrorism.\u201d\n\nNow, however, Panetta believes that the president has \u201clost his way\u201d because since then because he\u2019s shown greater \u201cambivalence\u201d about using military force. If Obama is willing to \u201croll up his sleeves\u201d on ISIS he can restore that strong legacy. For Panetta, might always equals right.\n\nPanetta likes to present himself an \u201chonest,\u201d \u201cstraight-talking,\u201d aw-shucks kind of guy\u2014the son of Italian immigrants who has lived the American Dream. But in reality he is the quintessential example of how Washington corrupts. Principles are conditional and where you sit is where you stand; politics trumps policy, even bad policy that puts American lives at risk; military force is a magic elixir not only in solving international problems but in burnishing one\u2019s public image (though it appears for Panetta that this mainly applies to Democrats); it\u2019s also the most important criteria in how you judge a president\u2019s national security decision-making and his or her requisite strength.\n\nDuring a recent interview on CNN, Panetta took a break from bashing the president who appointed him to two Cabinet offices to offer one of those platitudes that long-time DC denizens love to state without a moment of introspection. \u201cLogic doesn\u2019t work in Washington,\u201d he said.\n\nYou can say that again.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:52.239+0000"}
{"entityId": 1847, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "These days behind every great man is a great think tank. And Scott Walker is no exception.\n\nThe 2011 protests against Governor Scott Walker\u2019s collective bargaining overhaul made for an emotionally challenging day for one intern.\n\nThe intern in question was working for a conservative think tank called the MacIver Institute, and his superiors sent him up to the capitol with a video camera to tape the protesters at their wackiest.\n\nWhen one protester spotted him and realized who he was with, he gave chase, yelling profanity.\n\n\u201cI felt bad,\u201d said Brett Healey, the president of the MacIver Institute, who relayed to me this tale\u2014noting the intern escaped unharmed and the protester apologized. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have to call his mom and say, \u2018Your son got into an altercation his first day.\u2019\u201d\n\nHis mom shouldn\u2019t have been surprised.\n\nAfter Democrats took full control of the state government in 2008, there was a Cambrian explosion of conservative organizations that have worked overtime to push the historically progressive state in a rapidly rightward direction.\n\nAnd while Walker\u2019s ascent on the national political scene (and, of course, in the Republican presidential sweepstakes) has been quick, dramatic, and seemingly inexorable, he couldn\u2019t have zipped to the top of the polls without the conservative groups that have propelled his rise and repelled his enemies.\n\nPerhaps more than any other candidate eyeing the Oval Office, Walker has benefitted from home-state organizers and funders who have mastered the art of defending conservatives and making their foes look like dopes. And the MacIver Institute has been right in the thick of it.\n\nMacIver, along with a host of other conservative groups, is backed in part by the Bradley Foundation, which has built a tiny empire in the Midwestern state and had substantial influence on Walker\u2019s conservative agenda.\n\nBradley-backed groups have helped expedite Walker\u2019s ascent to power, and their success shows just how much clout wealthy donors and strategic activists can have on the way a state gets governed.\n\nThis is a long story, so I\u2019ll try to be concise.\n\nIn 2008, Wisconsin Republicans got totally shellacked.\n\nBy the end of Election Night, Democratic Governor Jim Doyle had cruised to re-election and his party controlled both chambers of the state legislature. One Wisconsin Democratic consultant said his party had a sort of embarrassment of riches; they\u2019d had a great year in 2006 as well, so they found themselves with lots of power but (comparatively) little in the way of long-term strategy. Those were the salad days.\n\nThey didn\u2019t last.\n\nAround the time of the Tea Party wave, deep-pocketed Republicans started investing heavily in conservative infrastructure.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported in 2011, in an in-depth look at the organization , that the Bradley Foundation spent more than $350 million between 2001 and 2010 to support a host of philanthropic endeavors, including arts organizations and national policy groups. Recipients included the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and Reason magazine.\n\nConservative activists in Wisconsin have been beneficiaries of much of that largesse.\n\nIn the Badger State, the Bradley Foundation has helped fund MacIver, as well as Media Trackers\u2014a group that digs for dirt on Democrats\u2014and the Wisconsin Reporter, a conservative news site that is a project of the Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity, according to Wisconsin-based Cap Times . Bradley also helps fund the Wisconsin chapter of American Majority, a conservative organization that trains activists on how to volunteer on campaigns, do issue advocacy, and run for office.\n\nMatt Batzel, American Majority\u2019s national executive director, said its Wisconsin chapter has had about 140 activist training sessions since 2010. Among the people they\u2019ve trained, 128 have gone on to win races for local- or state-level offices in the state.\n\nSince they got hosed in 2008, conservative influence in the state has metastasized rapidly.\n\nBut Walker was their crown jewel.\n\nThese days behind every great man is a great think tank. And Scott Walker is no exception.\n\nIn 2010, Walker won the governorship, Republicans took control of the majority of the state\u2019s congressional delegation, and Democrats lost both chambers of the state legislature.\n\nLiberals were agog.\n\nNow, pretend you\u2019re Scott Walker and you\u2019ve just gotten inaugurated on a cold January day in 2011. You\u2019re governing a state that birthed the modern labor movement and that\u2019s been a stronghold for the blue-collar Democrats for most of the modern era. You\u2019re in power, but your situation is\u2014to put it lightly\u2014precarious. How do you govern? If you were a typical governor in a typical version of that scenario, you would govern very, very cautiously. You would tiptoe. You would hedge. You would compromise. You would be Mitt Romney.\n\nBut Scott Walker is not Mitt Romney. And a large part of the reason he implemented such a proactively conservative agenda\u2014defunding Planned Parenthood, dramatically curtailing public-sector unions\u2019 power, passing Right to Work legislation\u2014is because of the conservative infrastructure that simultaneously pushed him in that direction and made that direction an easy way to go.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the collective bargaining overhaul, known as Act 10.\n\nA few weeks after Walker won the race for governor, MacIver\u2019s then-communications director, Brian Fraley, wrote an op-ed arguing for changes in the laws regarding public-sector unions and collective bargaining. That op-ed is widely seen as the blueprint for Act 10.\n\n\u201cWe used to be a state where we make things,\u201d wrote Fraley. \u201cNow we are a state that makes excuses for why the government behemoth cannot be tamed. That must change.\u201d\n\nAnd that changed.\n\nJust two months after Walker\u2019s inauguration, he signed Act 10 and set off protests of Biblical proportions.\n\nMacIver not only helped lay the policy groundwork for Act 10, it also helped manage its aftermath.\n\nThough the organization is a think tank, it also has an effective media arm.\n\nMacIver sent staff members out with cameras to cover the protests, chatting up activists and making YouTube videos of the more eyebrow-raising encounters.\n\nA handful of MacIver videos went viral, got picked up by the Drudge Report, and nabbed national cable news coverage. One particularly popular video showed protesters writing fake doctor\u2019s notes so their fellow activists wouldn\u2019t get in trouble for skipping work.\n\nCritics charged there were problems with the video , and Democratic state Senator Chris Larson said it was \u201cessentially made up.\u201d But the push-back was powerless.\n\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s people giving out doctor\u2019s notes at the protests\u2014that became the dialogue,\u2019\u201d Larson said. \u201cIt ended up changing the debate.\u201d\n\nAnother MacIver viral video showed protesters wearing zombie face paint crashing an event where the governor was trying to address Special Olympics participants. Nick Novak, MacIver\u2019s director of communications, said there were many other media outlets at the event. But they didn\u2019t seem interested in the zombie attendees.\n\n\u201cIt seemed we were the only ones who were actually covering that aspect of it,\u201d Novak said.\n\nThe Wisconsin press corps has faced the same problems as other local newsrooms around the country: shrinking budgets, smaller circulations, and fewer reporters.\n\nConservative news-gathering groups like MacIver have moved into that vacuum and used their resources to push stories that reflect right-leaning values.\n\n\u201cThe media capacity to look into a governor and hold him accountable is diminishing at the same time this right-wing capacity to influence the media is increasing,\u201d said Robert Kraig, who heads the progressive Citizen Action of Wisconsin.\n\nMedia Trackers and Wisconsin Reporter, along with MacIver, have had impact. And their critics have noticed.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf there was no Bradley Foundation, there would be no Scott Walker,\u201d Larson said. \u201cThey have provided the insulation from criticism as well as the lubricant to move him forward over the last 20 years of his career.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a full-blown communication apparatus to defend whatever the governor is doing,\u201d said Kraig. \u201cThey\u2019ve given him a lot of cover, so he doesn\u2019t have to be the only target.\u201d\n\nScot Ross, who heads One Wisconsin Now, calls MacIver \u201ca propaganda factory for the failed Walker policies that have put Wisconsin near the bottom of the Midwest in job creation.\u201d\n\nOn the conservative side, activists and lawmakers are delighted with the work of MacIver and other Bradley-funded groups.\n\nRepublican state Senator Leah Vukmir added that MacIver\u2019s defense of Act 10 helped shore up support for the governor as energy on the left was growing for the recall.\n\n\u201cAll the naysayers were saying that Act 10 was the worst thing in the world, that the sky was going to fall, and that there wouldn\u2019t be enough teachers to teach classes, school sports would end,\u201d Vukmir said. \u201c[MacIver] highlighted the positive things that were happening. Those weren\u2019t easy to find in the beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re kind of a combination of a think tank and media,\u201d said state Representative Dale Kooyenga, a Republican. \u201cThey\u2019re part of the whole messaging machine.\u201d\n\nHe said that MacIver was instrumental in the efforts to change the tax code that were part of the governor\u2019s 2013 budget. The think tank is also an energetic proponent of Right to Work policies like the one that Wisconsin adopted in March. Walker initially said he didn\u2019t plan to push for Right to Work. But the state\u2019s conservative legislature, with the vocal support of its conservative media establishment, pushed forward anyway.\n\n\u201cThey can get these stories into the bloodstream, they can push reforms,\u201d said Collin Roth, the managing editor of Right Wisconsin. \u201cRight to Work was a perfect example.\u201d\n\nOthers differ; Larson calls them \u201cdangerous\u201d and says they exist \u201csolely to push corporate interests.\u201d\n\nAnd now that the governor is looking to cut funds for the University of Wisconsin system as part of his 2015 budget proposal, MacIver is again playing a key role as advocate and attack dog.\n\nSo it\u2019s sort of understandable that anti-Walker protesters would chase around the MacIver Institute\u2019s junior-level interns. MacIver\u2014with the help of Bradley Foundation funding\u2014has been an integral part of Wisconsin conservatives\u2019 efforts to push Walker to the right and then to make his rightward migration politically safe.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:53.069+0000"}

Our thoughts and prayers are with these brave officers who, like thousands of their brethren across the United States, form a thin blue line that protects citizens in communities large and small regardless of their wealth, skin color, or religious beliefs.\n\nYet, something perverse has permeated our culture in America today, a culture where taking personal responsibility for one\u2019s actions has been replaced by a grievance industry that promotes white privilege as the root cause for all that ails them. Sadly, America\u2019s first African-American President and Attorney General have encouraged this myth\u2014with the media promoting an agenda rather than dispassionately reporting facts.\n\nThe fact is, most Americans never should have even heard about a shooting involving Michael Brown and police officer Darren Wilson. Every day in communities large and small, criminals commit crimes that elicit interaction from the police. In the instant case, it is a fact that Michael Brown committed a crime in a small town on August 9, 2014, failed to heed Officer Wilson\u2019s instructions, and was shot to death when the officer thought his life was in danger. The shooting never should have happened\u2014a young man never should have committed a crime and never should have rushed at a police officer.\n\nSadly, this incident provided the perfect opportunity for those who think that America is inherently racist and permanently ensconced in a 1965 Selma, Alabama, mindset with an opportunity: an opportunity to declare that a racist cop had gunned down an innocent black youth as the teen shouted \u201cHands up, Don\u2019t Shoot\u201d\u2014a fictional account that never happened.\n\nOn matters of race involving local police investigations, President Obama has not been shy about injecting himself into the narrative while shaping the desired outcomes. In 2009 when Harvard Professor Henry Louis \u201cSkip\u201d Gates had a disagreement with a Cambridge police officer outside of his home leading to his arrest, the president opined that the officer \u201cacted stupidly.\u201d Never mind that Mr. Gates didn\u2019t have his keys and was thought to be breaking into a home by the police officer in question. What I found revealing at the time is that the president offered the Gates incident as showing how \u201crace remains a factor in this society today\u201d when the facts revealed race had nothing to do with the interaction between a professor and a police officer.\n\nThe fact is, most Americans never should have even heard about a shooting involving Michael Brown and police officer Darren Wilson.\n\nTurning to the ginned-up cauldron of race that is now Ferguson, the president was once again quick to offer his opinion on local matter on which he knew nothing of the facts at hand. Days following the shooting the president assured the press that he had sent both the FBI and the Department of Justice to investigate the shooting of Michael Brown. Of particular relevance, Mr. Obama offered:\n\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s important to remember how this started. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old. His family will never hold Michael in their arms again. And when something like this happens, the local authorities\u2014including the police\u2014have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death, and how they are protecting the people in their communities.\u201d\n\nThe circumstances under which Brown lost his life are both heartbreaking and tragic\u2014but not in the manner implied by the president. Rather than waiting for local authorities to complete their investigation, the president took sides\u2014particularly with the \u201chis family will never hold Michael in their arms again\u201d line. The implication here is that a white police gunned down a young black man in a manner that was irresponsible and opaque.\n\nThe narrative thus set, Al Sharpton and the media descended upon Ferguson alongside outside agitators who marched with such slogans as \u201cNo Justice, No Peace\u201d or \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot.\u201d More unrest would follow when the grand jury elected not to indict the officer for the tragic shooting. Riots and looting would ensue\u2014with breathless coverage in the media and little from the President of the United States and the Attorney General to quell the violence.\n\nThe promised civil rights investigation by the Department of Justice was delivered on March 4, 2015. While the DOJ cited specific incidents of racism in the Ferguson police department leading to the resignation of the Mayor and the Chief of Police, the federal government substantiated the fact that Wilson\u2019s shooting of Brown wasn\u2019t motivated by race. The same Department of Justice that went into Ferguson to determine whether Michael Brown\u2019s civil rights were violated left having concluded that Wilson\u2019s shooting was deemed justified in light of the facts. I must give Holder\u2019s Justice Department credit for this impartial finding. But I\u2019m saddened that it was a finding that neither the president nor the media were interested in learning in the first place. The \u201cAmerica is racist\u201d narrative was broadcast endlessly, and our president did nothing to stop it.\n\nSo today in Ferguson, our thoughts and prayers are with two shot police officers who are tasked to protect and serve their community.

I\u2019m thinking of the future of our space program and what role private enterprise will play in it, I think about the Higgs boson, I think about searching for life on Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, I think about how quickly all the people who were the first pioneers on Mars will die after they arrive. Things like that.\n\nYou said \u201csearching for life on Jupiter\u2019s moon,\u201d so it would stand to reason, then, that you believe in the existence of aliens.\n\nWell, it\u2019s not a matter of \u201cbelief.\u201d \u201cBelief\u201d implies that you feel something is true without evidence. I have a strong suspicion that something is true given the evidence, and that\u2019s how I feel about life in the universe. You can look at how long the universe has existed. You can look at the ingredients for life as we know it. You can look at how common those very ingredients are throughout the galaxy and throughout the universe. You can look at how quickly life took hold on Earth\u2014basically within a couple of hundred million years after it possibly could have formed, it formed\u2014and that\u2019s small compared with the age of the Earth, which is 4.5 billion years. And if you look at how many stars there are, and how many planets there are that are likely to be around them based on new data, you add all this up and say, \u201cIt would be inexcusably egocentric to suggest that we were the only life in the universe.\u201d That is the posture that informed people take who study this. The prospect of there being life is not an exotic thought.\n\n\u201cSo, you have people who are certain that a man in a robe transforms a cracker into the literal body of Jesus saying that what goes on in Scientology is crazy?\u201d\n\n\n\nDo you feel there\u2019s ever been an \u201cevent\u201d?\n\nWell, with UFOs, we have to remind ourselves what the \u201cU\u201d stands for: Unidentified. For some reason over the decades, people have made the UFO synonymous with intelligent aliens visiting us from another planet in a flying saucer, but if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking at, you should just stop talking. The thought should end there. You can\u2019t say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking at, therefore it must be intelligent aliens from another galaxy visiting Earth.\u201d You have no place to stand to make that claim.\n\nSpeaking of aliens, did you see HBO\u2019s Scientology documentary Going Clear?\n\nNo. I heard about it, though. I\u2019m familiar with it.\n\nI\u2019m curious what your take on Scientology is, because the intergalactic story of Xenu does encroach on your territory a bit.\n\nSo, you have people who are certain that a man in a robe transforms a cracker into the literal body of Jesus saying that what goes on in Scientology is crazy? Let\u2019s realize this: What matters is not who says who\u2019s crazy, what matters is we live in a free country. You can believe whatever you want, otherwise it\u2019s not a free country\u2014it\u2019s something else. If we start controlling what people think and why they think it, we have case studies where that became the norm. I don\u2019t care what the tenets are of Scientology. They don\u2019t distract me. I don\u2019t judge them, and I don\u2019t criticize them.\n\nNow, where the rubber hits the road is, since we are a free country where belief systems are constitutionally protected\u2014provided they don\u2019t infringe on the rights of others\u2014then how do you have governance over \u201call\u201d when you have belief systems for the \u201csome\u201d? It seems to me that the way you govern people is you base governance on things that are objectively true; that are true regardless of your belief system, or no matter what the tenets are of your holy documents. And then they should base it on objective truths that apply to everyone. So the issue comes about not that there are religious people in the world that have one view over another, it\u2019s if you have one view or another based on faith and you want to legislate that in a way that affects everyone. That\u2019s no longer a free democracy. That\u2019s a country where the few who have a belief system that\u2019s not based in objective reality want to control the behavior of everyone else.\n\nThe documentary essentially argues that Scientology shouldn\u2019t be granted tax-exempt status as a religion.\n\nBut why aren\u2019t they a religion? What is it that makes them a religion and others are religions? If you attend a Seder, there\u2019s an empty chair sitting right there and the door is unlocked because Elijah might walk in. OK. These are educated people who do this. Now, some will say it\u2019s ritual, some will say it could literally happen. But religions, if you analyze them, who is to say that one religion is rational and another isn\u2019t? It looks like the older those thoughts have been around, the likelier it is to be declared a religion. If you\u2019ve been around 1,000 years you\u2019re a religion, and if you\u2019ve been around 100 years, you\u2019re a cult. That\u2019s how people want to divide the kingdom. Religions have edited themselves over the years to fit the times, so I\u2019m not going to sit here and say Scientology is an illegitimate religion and other religions are legitimate religions. They\u2019re all based on belief systems. Look at Mormonism! There are ideas that are as space-exotic within Mormonism as there are within Scientology, and it\u2019s more accepted because it\u2019s a little older than Scientology is, so are we just more accepting of something that\u2019s older?\n\n\n\nThe line I\u2019m drawing is that there are religions and belief systems, and objective truths. And if we\u2019re going to govern a country, we need to base that governance on objective truths\u2014not your personal belief system.\n\nThe separation of church and state\u2014which we\u2019re not too great at practicing in this country.\n\nYeah. The Constitution makes no mention of Jesus, God, or anything. The Constitution is religion-free on purpose, which I\u2019ve read was controversial. They were smart. They said, \u201cWell, if we mention god, then it establishes a religion, and that would give the government power to influence your belief system, and you would no longer have a free country.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re seeing it right now with this \u201creligious freedom law\u201d in Indiana.\n\nI just think it\u2019s a little weird that there\u2019s a law that allows you to earn less money. I think that\u2019s weird within a capitalist democracy. If you\u2019re a company and you don\u2019t agree with it, you don\u2019t put your factories there, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good for your economy. Usually the economy wins in the end in terms of decision-making, so we\u2019ll see what comes of this.\n\nAs a scientist, does homophobia strike you as particularly odd? There are many species within the animal kingdom that are attracted to the same sex, and perhaps if people were more educated in the sciences instead of religious dogma, then there would be less homophobia.\n\nWell, it almost always entirely stems from religion. But the point here is that if you\u2019re religious, and your religion tells you that being gay is bad, then don\u2019t be gay. But you have to remind yourself that that\u2019s your belief system, and there are other belief systems that don\u2019t agree with that, so you should not be in the position to make legislation that affects other people.\n\nI enjoyed your Daily Show riff on The Walking Dead disproving the likelihood of zombies.\n\nEverything I know about The Walking Dead is because my son watched every episode, so he clues me in. They brought me in on it, so I have some fluency in The Walking Dead. I\u2019m intrigued by how they do it. I like watching the odd characters rise up in the face of this apocalyptic Earth, and you know that these people would be there\u2014the people you think you know but you don\u2019t, and there\u2019s something weird about them. That\u2019s what makes the show intriguing\u2014not just learning how people would react in the face of aliens, but how people would react with each other in the face of aliens. That\u2019s what makes it a rich tapestry.\n\nSee any movies recently?\n\nI just saw Whiplash. It was interesting. Here\u2019s why I take issue with it. It\u2019s one jazz musician and one overbearing coach, so I get that, but I come from a world where true success is completely driven from within the individual and not from someone outside of them. While the case portrayed there is some fraction of cases that are out there, at the end of the day, Einstein became Einstein not because someone said, \u201cKeep studying, keep studying!\u201d and someone didn\u2019t say, \u201cIsaac Newton, go invent calculus!\u201d He invented it on his own. So in my world, there is no success without people being self-driven, and to believe that you only achieve greatness because someone pushed you there? I don\u2019t see that. The story was nonetheless intriguing, but I feel it may be the minority of cases who have succeeded in a singular way in life. If someone treats you that way, you may become really good at something but you won\u2019t become the greatest at it, and you\u2019ll resent them and you might even turn away from the subject entirely.\n\nPresident George W. Bush named you to a pair of aerospace commissions, but how do you feel about Bush\u2019s relationship with science? He was also someone who believed in \u201cintelligent design\u201d and is widely known to have suppressed scientific discussion of global warming during his administration.\n\nPeople can say and think what they want, but what matters is whether or not it becomes policy or legislation, and I don\u2019t remember any legislation that restricted science. In fact, the budget for the National Science Foundation went up. What matters is money in Congress. What does Congress do? Allocate money. That\u2019s really what they do. So the science budget of the country went up during the Bush administration, and the budget for NASA went up 3 percent\u2014and it had actually dropped 25 percent in real spending dollars under the eight years of President Clinton. I don\u2019t care what you say or think. I care about legislation, and policy.\n\nAlso, he appointed me! There may have been some science that he hadn\u2019t learned yet or didn\u2019t know fully, but he\u2019s not creating legislation based on it. Speeches are politics, so you can\u2019t fault a politician for saying something political.\n\nI think it\u2019s been proven, though, that the Bush administration was systematically suppressing and altering reports on global warming from the scientific community. This has been proven multiple times.\n\nRight. But did he succeed? He was caught. There were some documents where someone was caught rubbing out the term \u201cbig bang\u201d and it was found, and the guy lost his job. What I\u2019m saying is I\u2019ve become much more pragmatic about all of this. Washington is about politics, and Bush has an electoral base that want him to behave certain ways, but what matters is policy. People were saying there was a \u201cRepublican War on Science,\u201d and I say, \u201cWhat war are you talking about?\u201d And they say, \u201cWell, they\u2019re suppressing stem cell research. Oh, and there\u2019s the environment. And the Republicans are in bed with oil companies.\u201d So I check those boxes and say, \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d Well, no, not really. The budget for the NSF went up. The budget for NASA went up. The budget for the National Institutes of Health that gives grants for health research went up. So it\u2019s not really a war on science. It\u2019s a resistance to things that interfere with their two political agendas: one religion-based, the other oil-based. There it is. It\u2019s called politics.\n\nI really enjoyed Cosmos, and it was such a huge hit. Is it coming back?\n\nWe\u2019re in conversations now, we\u2019re just trying to figure out if we do it again how we would do it, could we do it more efficiently\u2014since the first one was stretched out over such a long period of time, and we were figuring stuff out as we went along. We\u2019re in conversations now, but nothing\u2019s been announced yet. There\u2019s more than 13 hours of universe. If you have 13 hours of Game of Thrones, I can at least do that with the entire universe!", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:53.683+0000"}
{"entityId": 1850, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Syrian strongman is playing a crafty game that\u2019s starting to splinter the opposition. The White House should say he must go.\n\nThursday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said for the first time what everyone knows\u2014that Bashar al-Assad \u201cderives some benefit\u201d from the bombing campaign against ISIS. This came immediately after the revelation that Hagel had written a terse memo to National Security Adviser Susan Rice warning that the Syria policy, as The New York Times put it, \u201cwas in danger of unraveling because of its failure to clarify its intentions toward President Bashar al-Assad.\u201d\n\nHagel is correct, and there are two main reasons why: first, Assad has been very cynically crafty about making it look like his regime is working with the coalition, which splinters and dispirits the opposition. Second, the regime, like ISIS but unlike the opposition, knows the tribes of Syria, where ISIS mostly operates, well and is now beginning to exploit those relationships to its benefit. But while the regime\u2019s machinations are producing impressive results, they are limited, short lived and are increasingly diminishing the rebels\u2019 trust in the mission, which is further complicating the effort to uproot ISIS in Syria. If the anti-ISIS mission is to succeed, the international coalition must make it much clearer that Assad needs to go\u2014and reflect that in concert steps on the ground.\n\nWhen the United States decided to strike against the Islamic State inside Syria, it was both morally and practically right not to align with the Assad regime. Alliance with the regime, which killed thousands of Syrian civilians systematically and with impunity for three years, would have made it much harder to form a regional coalition to fight ISIS and even harder to find rebel forces willing to cooperate with the mission.\n\nSince then, however, the situation with regard to the fight against ISIS has changed.\n\nImmediately after the airstrikes began, the Syrian regime took the initiative to force itself into the international alliance. The regime quickly made it clear to Syrians that there was, at least, a de facto collaboration between the international coalition and the Syrian authorities. Syrian warplanes launched a bombing campaign in areas where ISIS and other jihadist groups operated, in eastern and northern Syria.\n\nAccording to rebels in those areas, Syrian warplanes bombed areas controlled by groups other than ISIS or Jabhat al-Nusra, the extremist group from which ISIS broke last year, near the same times the international coalition struck jihadists\u2019 targets, to give the impression either that the regime and the international coalition are working together, or that the coalition is striking other targets beyond ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra.\n\nThe first thing to do is to pressure Assad out, because that\u2019s the most toxic element of the conflict.\n\nThe regime\u2019s game seems to be working. Increasingly, cynicism among the rebels toward the airstrikes is entrenched and this attitude has led to a new trend: Fighting between Syrian rebels and the Islamic State, common in most areas only two months ago, is now noticeably rare. Just before the airstrikes began in Syria, the Syrian Revolutionary Front, Legion 5, Raqqa Revolutionaries Brigade, and other Free Syrian Army and Kurdish factions pledged to take the fight against ISIS to areas controlled by the jihadist group.\n\nToday, these groups have either backed down on such promises or been occupied by infighting or by desperate attempts to hold back the advances of the Syrian regime in Aleppo and Idlib. Even in Kobane and eastern Aleppo, where rebel forces are battling ISIS, it was because ISIS brought the fight to them, not the other way around.\n\nMeanwhile, major rebel forces in the north have been engaged in serious infighting over the past week. This significantly undermines the rebels\u2019 standing in northern Syria and minimizes their capabilities to push against ISIS in Raqqa.\n\nThe regime, on the other hand, seems to be stepping up its fight against ISIS targets in the Aleppo eastern countryside, in Hasaka, and in Deir Ezzor. In Aleppo, the regime\u2019s frontlines are getting ever closer to those of ISIS in the eastern parts of the city.\n\nInside ISIS-held areas, the Assad regime is quietly working to revitalize long-existing intelligence networks to fight ISIS there. According to sources in eastern Syria, the regime has established a training camp for members of tribes in the desert of Palmyra and has been encouraging local tribes to rise up against ISIS, through a network locally known as \u201cJamie Jamie\u201d after a regime officer who was killed last year.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that ISIS operates in predominantly tribal areas, and the jihadist group has a decade-long experience of dealing with tribes in Iraq and in Syria. But the other force that is well positioned to deal with tribes is the Assad regime, especially if compared to the Syrian opposition, which has failed to tap into tribal labyrinth throughout the uprising. The regime\u2019s experience with tribes and its intelligence links to individuals in tribal areas give it an advantage over the opposition\u2014although not necessarily over ISIS, since the regime lacks the popular support and credibility in those areas as well as the manpower to fill the void after ISIS.\n\nHowever lacking in popular support, though, the regime has the keys and the coherent institutional structure to instigate and accommodate a rebellion against ISIS. That can only happen, though, through a credible political process that is acceptable to the communities currently under ISIS rule, who tend to oppose the regime. Given the ISIS grip on its territories, the process will have to involve deep knowledge and connection about these areas but also incentives and political legitimacy. In tribal areas, such legitimacy cannot be gained while Assad in power.\n\nThe United States should use the airstrikes and the coalition assembled around it to make sure that there is a regional consensus to deal with the Syrian conflict. The first thing to do is to pressure Assad out, because that\u2019s the most toxic element of the conflict. Putting Assad into a leaving process will convince many people in the opposition and within the silent majority who are now skeptical to think about joining the process. Unless that takes place, people will see any effort that does not target the Assad regime as illegitimate, and that will only play into the hands of ISIS.\n\nHassan Hassan is an analyst with the Delma Institute, a research center in Abu Dhabi.

{"entityId": 1851, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Obama\u2019s retreat on immigration was an unforced error, but we probably won\u2019t see real reform until the 2020s anyway.\n\nThe only thing about the Obama White House\u2019s weekend decision to delay any action on immigration that surprised me was why the president had earlier promised to act before the election in the first place. He made the vow on June 30, and I remember thinking at the time how strange it seemed.\n\nWhy? Simple electoral politics. You need to spend literally no more than 40 seconds looking at a map of the pivotal Senate races to see that, to be perfectly blunt about it, the Latino vote just isn\u2019t a factor. Democrats are defending seats in the following states: North Carolina, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Alaska on the first tier; Iowa, New Hampshire, Michigan, and Colorado on the second. Only in Colorado is the Latino vote sizeable. In the other seven states, especially the first four, Democrats are running in red states where they need to win a lot more white votes than Democrats usually do these days. And the same is true in the states where Democrats hope they might steal a Republican Senate seat\u2014Georgia, Kentucky, and I suppose now we at least theoretically add Kansas (technically it\u2019s an independent, not a Democrat, who stands a chance of unseating the GOP incumbent). These jurisdictions are not the Bronx, to put it mildly.\n\nThere are a few House districts where it might matter. Read this very interesting blog post from David Damore at Latino Decisions about how the Latino vote will figure into some House races, for example in the first and second districts of Arizona, where pro-immigration Democrats are defending their seats against well-financed, anti-immigration Republicans. But overall, Damore argues that Democrats\u2019 poor candidate-recruitment efforts in GOP-held House districts with reasonably large Latino populations mean that a number of Republicans who could have faced decent challenges are getting a pass.\n\nSo if it\u2019s just not a year when the Latino vote is going to be pivotal, why did Obama say what he said in June? It seemed and seems like an unforced error to me, like not anticipating that Bowe Bergdahl and his father were going to pop the Breitbart meter. Sometimes the political people at the White House just appear to be asleep. I suppose we have to allow for the possibility that he wanted to do the right thing. But to get the right thing done in politics, you have to do it at the right time. I kind of hate this category of overworked Obama-LBJ comparisons, but when Johnson became president, he didn\u2019t charge right into civil rights. The first big bill he passed? A tax cut. Loosen \u2019em up, give \u2019em an easy vote, throw a little bouquet to the right, then go in for the liberal kill.\n\nObama\u2019s opinions and actions on the question won\u2019t matter for much longer. The spotlight will soon fix itself on the presumptive Democratic 2016 nominee, whose name, I think, we all know.\n\nMaybe Obama and his people thought back in June that they\u2019d be showing the Republicans\u2014and Latino voters\u2014that they had some stones. Maybe they were hoping they\u2019d galvanize Latino opinion and drive up Latino turnout this fall. But clearly they were getting no indication that was happening, and now, in this about-face, they\u2019ve ended up with the opposite result. Republicans are chortling and Latinos are fuming, over a promise that Obama was under no overwhelming pressure to make to start with.\n\nDespite whatever acidic rhetoric Latino leaders are dishing out toward Obama today, I would expect that will change this fall. He\u2019ll announce his unilateral moves on immigration after the election. The Republicans will boil with rage. In all likelihood, they\u2019ll move to impeach. So then we\u2019ll have the spectacle of one party\u2014the party that has blocked the passage of an immigration bill in the first place\u2014seeking to throw a president of the other party out of office for trying to do something on immigration that he wouldn\u2019t have had to do if the first party hadn\u2019t spent two years refusing to pass a bill. It\u2019s pretty clear which side of that fence the vast majority of Latinos are going to come down on.\n\nAnd anyway, Obama\u2019s opinions and actions on the question won\u2019t matter for much longer. The spotlight will soon fix itself on the presumptive Democratic 2016 nominee, whose name, I think, we all know. Keeping Latino loyalty to her party up in the 70-plus percent range is going be Hillary Clinton\u2019s job starting next year.\n\nI think she\u2019ll manage to do that. She and her husband always have. Among the possible contenders on the GOP side, only Chris Christie has shown the remotest ability to change that dynamic, but after how relentlessly anti-immigrant his party has been these last couple of years, even he could have a hard time getting more than a third of the Latino vote.\n\nWhat all this is really telling us is that we\u2019re not going to see real immigration reform in this country anytime soon. If you asked me to guess, I would say the soonest it could happen would be during President Hillary Clinton\u2019s second term. Immigration reform means a path to citizenship for people who came here illegally. The party of old white people who are law-and-order types to begin with and who fear what\u2019s happening to the country they thought they knew just isn\u2019t going to budge on that question until it really and truly has to.\n\nThat means, if Clinton wins, reform will never happen in her first term\u2014there\u2019s no way Republicans would hand her that huge a political victory as she\u2019s gearing up to get herself reelected. It would be only after a 2020 loss\u2014the party\u2019s fourth straight, that would be\u2014and a chance to start fresh with Latino voters in an open race in 2024 that the GOP might relent. And even then, it will depend on how riled up the white base is, whether Rush Limbaugh is still around filling their heads with hate, and kindred factors. And of course if Clinton doesn\u2019t win and there\u2019s a Republican president, reform (at least reform that includes a path to citizenship) becomes extremely unlikely.\n\nSo Obama mishandled this one. But don\u2019t worry: Bleak as things seem today, rest assured they can get worse.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:54.458+0000"}
{"entityId": 1852, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Democrats are pushing race and environmental issues when they should be embracing the lunch-bucket themes that once built party dominance. Meanwhile, voters flee.\n\nOnce giants walked this earth, and some of them were Democrats. In sharp contrast to the thin gruel that passes for leadership today, the old party of the people, with all its flaws, shaped much of the modern world, and usually for the better. Think of Franklin Roosevelt or Harry Truman, John Kennedy, or California\u2019s Pat Brown, politicians who believed in American greatness, economic growth, and upward mobility.\n\nFor more than 40 years, the Democratic Party has drifted far from this tradition, its policies increasingly a blend of racial and gender politics combined with a fashionable brand of environmental fanaticism. No longer does it constitute a reliable, middle class-based alternative to the corporatist mindset of the Republicans. \u201cToday\u2019s Democrats have no more in common with Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson ,\u201d notes author Michael Lind, \u201cthan today\u2019s Republicans have in common with Abraham Lincoln or Dwight Eisenhower. \u201c\n\nTo regain their relevancy, Democrats need to go back to their evolutionary roots. Their clear priorities : faster economic growth and promoting upward mobility for the middle and working classes. All other issues\u2014racial, feminine, even environmental\u2014need to fit around this central objective. In survey after survey, economic issues such as unemployment, the economy, and the federal budget top the list of concerns while affirmative action, gay rights, and climate change barely register.\n\nFrom Obama Back to Jackson\n\nDemocrats do not need to become Republican lite, as was true among some New Democrats (I was a fellow with the Progressive Policy Institute, the New Democrats think tank). Democrats need to respond aggressively to the crony capitalism practiced by many Republicans, particularly regarding Wall Street. But they can\u2019t do that if all they offer in its place are policies that service instead their own cronies not only in finance, but technology and media as well.\n\nRight now it\u2019s hard to make the case that the Democrats have a strategy to improve the economic prospects of the middle class. The New York Times\u2019s Tom Edsall notes notes that after six years of Obama, voters stubbornly hold unto pessimistic views about the future. Of course, declining or stagnant wage growth started well before this president took office. Nevetheless, Democratic rule has not only failed to halt the trend, but appears to have accelerated it.\n\nNot surprisingly, many middle and working class voters, particularly whites, have deserted the Democrats in increasing numbers. This November, notes Gallup, support for Obama among white college graduates dropped to 41 percent while his support among those without degrees fell to a pathetic 27 percent.\n\nIn the past the old Democrats saw the country\u2019s broad resources and continental scale as primary sources of national greatness.\n\n\n\nCritically, in 2014 this erosion began to extend to millennials; white millennials, particularly those without BAs (the vast majority), went Republican. This is a generation that, according to the Census, is both somewhat more educated than previous ones but far more likely to live in poverty.\n\nAlthough likely to reject Republican views on social issues, such as gay marriage, millennials may not become \u201cpermanently blue,\u201d as imagined by some boomer progressives. Faced with the consequences of slow, and poorly distributed growth, they are already less likely to see themselves as environmentalists than the national average and particularly the generally better off boomers.\n\nSome progressives suggest that working class voters, particularly whites, can be lured back to the party by expanding the welfare state even further. But such an approach works against the traditional pride in self-sufficiency espoused by many in the American middle class. The old Jacksonians challenged financial power\u2014then the Bank of the United States\u2014but also worked to expand the economy, opening new lands to settlement, and encouraging home ownership and grassroots entrepreneurship.\n\nThe Key Issue: Energy and Climate Change\n\nIt would be difficult to find an issue with less resonance with the vast majority of voters than climate change. Concern over the environment has dropped since the Recession, notes Gallup, with climate change ranking near the bottom in voter concerns. In this sense, the emergence of Tom Steyer and other gentry yokes the party to a message with limited appeal once you get a few miles inland from either coast.\n\nThis does not reflect lack of interest in a better environment. Instead, it is a rejection of the Clerisy\u2019s \u201csolutions\u201d to environmental challenges\u2014such as banning suburbs, hiking electricity rates, and opposing new pipelines. These policies don\u2019t hurt the super-rich; they hurt middle and working class voters. Lower oil prices, a product of fracking and other new drilling technologies, represents a boon to the dispersed, largely suburban electorate. But at the same time cheap gas offends progressive writers like the New Yorker\u2019s Michael Specter, who argues that lower oil prices simply reinforces our addiction to an \u201cindustrial form of crack.\u201d\n\nIn the next decade, the Obama administration\u2019s bizarrely na\u00efve \u201cagreement\u201d with China threatens to further weaken middle class interests. The South China Morning Post suggests westerners should be skeptical about prospects that China will sacrifice economic growth and, even more important, political stability in favor of planetary salvation. As one Canadian commentator put it, the Chinese deal constituted \u201ca promise in a rented tuxedo\u201d by a country that will cross \u201cits coal fired heart\u201d while the U.S. and the E.U. essentially disarm their economies with ever more draconian regulation.\n\nSadly, this choice between growth and climate change may not be necessary. The development of new drilling techniques has sparked a shift from coal fired power to natural gas that has allowed the U.S. to reduce its emissions faster than any major country, far more, indeed, than the self-righteous Europeans whose expensive and inefficient green policies have left them burning more coal.\n\nExpanding, Not Constraining Geography\n\nThe rapid shrinking of the party\u2019s geographic base is one clear legacy of the Obama years. Energy policy has been key here. Democratic losses have been heavy in those parts of the country that either produce fossil fuels, such as Louisiana, Texas, Colorado, Utah, and Montana, or those, notably in the upper Midwest, that depend on cheap fossil fuels to drive their still critical manufacturing sectors.\n\nThe losses of Democrats in states like Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin are arguably the most critical since these are traditionally swing states. The Steyer strategy of wiping out fossil fuels and raising energy costs might appeal to the denizens of climatically mild and highly affluent San Francisco. But people in a hardscrabble factory town in less temperate central Ohio or in greater Detroit , or even interior California, are less well-positioned to indulge green purity.\n\nAnd how about the South? As recently as 2008, Democrats held one-third of the South\u2019s Senate seats. Now it\u2019s down to two, one in Virginia and the other in Florida. Convinced the region is lost permanently, some suggest suggest that Democrats \u201cdump Dixie\u201d so as not to have to appeal to voters in what one progressive writer denounced as a \u201cfetid place.\u201d\n\nBut the South accounts for almost 40 percent of the nation\u2019s population, an impossibly large region to simply write off. But even progressives who want to take back the South, such as the New Republic\u2019s Michael Cooper seek to build a coalition of poor whites and minorities in alliance with the growing numbers of graduate-educated professionals. This does not really address the aspirational reasons why so many Americans have been migrating to this region.\n\nIn many ways these attitudes reflect the increasingly urban-centric focus of the party. It diverges dramatically from the approach of traditional Democrats, from Roosevelt and Truman to Clinton, himself the former governor of a poor Southern state, who looked favorably on dispersing growth, particularly to the traditionally poor South, intermountain West and Great Plains, as well to the suburban interior.\n\nHostility to the non-urban regions includes a detestation of suburbia. Progressive theorists, like Salon\u2019s Benjamin Ross, like to pin the detested \u201csuburban sprawl\u201d on Ronald Reagan, ignoring the basic fact that suburban growth was fostered for a half century by a Democratic controlled Congress, and was also favored by Democrats from Truman through Clinton. No surprise then that aside from wealthy coastal suburbs, the Democratic base has shrunk to the urban cores and college towns.\n\nInfrastructure for Growth\n\nSenator Charles Schumer\u2019s retro perspective about the folly of enacting Obamacare in 2009 revealed much. Schumer rightly pointed out that Obamacare, for all the positives associated with expanding health care coverage, helped a relatively small part of the electorate, as well as the insurance companies.\n\nA far better move in the early years of Obama\u2019s first term would have been to implement a updated version of the New Deal\u2019s Works Progress Administration. A new WPA would have helped create jobs and provided some training to underemployed or unemployed youth. It could have left a legacy of improved roads, bridges, expanding port facilities, and affordable (usually bus) mass transit options that would appeal to many Americans.\n\nIn contrast to Obamacare, a neo-WPA would have been a difficult target for the GOP. It likely would have appealed to many business people on Main Street, few of whom are free-market fundamentalists. But moves to push such a program elicited opposition from critical parts of the party base, including feminists, who feared that public works would disproportionately help \u201cburly men.\u201d\n\nGreens also were less than enthusiastic about new massive public works. Environmentalists today generally prefer to limit roads and block new water projects, even in parched California. So the Obama stimulus will be forever linked to insider deals with green energy epitomized by the Solyndra fiasco and massive loans to politically allied venture capitalists.\n\nClass Not Race\n\nThe growing opposition towards Hillary Clinton\u2019s ascension has one thing right: Democrats should not be seen as the second party of Wall Street. Obama\u2019s recovery and Fed policy have, as Democrats like Elizabeth Warren like to point out, often favored the financial oligarchs , although their support for Democrats makes them far less keen on taking on the Silicon Valley Venture Capitalists , who have also profited under Obama. High valuations\u2014even absurd ones\u2014enrich the insiders who found companies, underwriters, and merger mavens, but those valuations have done precious little for the vast majority of Americans.\n\nFaced with the loss of middle class voters, the administration seems determined to double down on its current coalition. So to whom do they turn to determine their future political direction? Not to a successful elected official from a swing district or a Main Street businessperson but to Google\u2019s Eric Schmidt, an oligopolist of the first order from the party\u2019s new heartland around the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nGiven their cozy ties to Wall Street and oligarchs like Schmidt, the Democrats have failed to push class warfare as an issue, preferring instead to play the racial trump card. They allow issues to be dominated by such flawed emissaries as the detestable Al Sharpton, whose job seems to be the stoking of African-American ire. Similarly, the president\u2019s executive order on undocumented residents follows this approach, by trying to appeal to Latino racial interests.\n\nYet race politics has limited appeal to whites, and ultimately may not guarantee keeping many minority voters in check. After all, minorities have fared poorly under Obama: a recent Pew study found minority incomes dropped 9 percent between 2010 and 2013, while only 1 percent among whites. Hispanics, notes a recent Pew survey economic issues easily trump immigration. Texas Republicans, for example, got close to half the vote among Latinos in that state, and similar results were found in Kansas. Even in places as blue-leaning as Colorado, Latino support for pro-growth Republicans has been growing. And Asians also showed a shift toward the GOP in the mid-terms.\n\nEmbrace Exceptionalism\n\nHistorically Democrats, like Republicans, believed in American Exceptionalism. This sometimes spills over into messianic overkill\u2014for example, under Woodrow Wilson and George W. Bush\u2014but overall the ideal of a uniquely American national profile has been embraced by Democrats from Jefferson and Jackson to Roosevelt, Truman and, arguably the last of the breed, Bill Clinton.\n\nPresident Obama, in contrast, has openly rejected this notion, perhaps reflecting the world view of academics and much of the financial world that sees American Exceptionalism as some sort of patriotic nonsense. In the past the old Democrats saw the country\u2019s broad resources and continental scale as primary sources of national greatness. Early conservationists did not oppose the expansion of industry, mining, or growth as inimical to progressive ideals; instead, they sought to restrain the abuses of the capitalist classes in order to prevent gouging as well as to preserve resources and open space for future generations.\n\nIn sharp contrast to their modern \u201cheirs,\u201d both Progressives and New Dealers were builders of dams, roads, and electrical power systems. They embraced the notion of a growing America, whose economy could be expanded for the benefit of the majority.\n\nIs There a Messenger For Dino-Democrats?\n\nHillary of the many houses, $200,000 speaking gigs, Wall Street linkages, and her aging, wealthy glitterati backers does not exactly appear the ideal messenger for a neo-Jacksonian revival. Rather than the \u201cshot and a beer\u201d Hillary who came back to almost save her 2008 effort, she now reflects gentry views on both economics and climate change in ways that do not significantly diverge from President Obama.\n\nWith dissatisfaction with the economic status quo strong among many traditional Democrats, it\u2019s likely populist candidates could emerge. Some imagine Senator Elizabeth Warren as the charismatic leader of a progressive version of the \u201ctea party.\u201d She has been a strong and vocal critic of Wall Street, which is to her credit, but her base lies not in middle class voters but among academia and wealthy Boston suburbs. On environmental issues, she seeks to out-green Hillary, something that might not appeal to voters in Ohio, Indiana, and a host of other key states.\n\nBernie Sanders, the self-described socialist, represents an emotionally appealing alternative to the endlessly grifting Clintons and the law professor Warren. But Sanders, a representative of the Northeastern vacation state of Vermont, also opposes fossil fuel development. This approach would greatly limit his appeal beyond the Northeast and the west coast. It\u2019s hard to envision him campaigning for votes at Great Lakes factories that depend on coal power, or appealing to construction workers who would love to see the Keystone and other pipelines built.\n\nRight now, former Virginia Senator James Webb may prove the best vehicle for dino-Democratic ideas. A self-conscious inheritor of the Jacksonian tradition, Webb epitomizes the individualist and populist values of his Scotch-Irish forebears. With a strong military background, he also appeals to nationalists who inhabit the South, Appalachia, and the non-coastal parts of the West. Whether his candidacy takes off is still an open question, but the ideas and spirit he embodies could revive a Democratic tradition that, although now submerged, might provide the party with a way out of its current morass.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:54.816+0000"}

Instead, he\u2019s behind in the polls as \u201cBrownbackistan\u201d falls apart.\n\nKansas Gov. Sam Brownback should be coasting to re-election this fall. The soft-spoken son of a Kansas pig farmer is the conservative governor of a deep red state, and he\u2019s running in a year when Republicans will likely have a national advantage over Democrats. Instead, Brownback is now fighting for political survival in what his detractors call the theocratic dictatorship of \u201cBrownbackistan.\u201d\n\nIf Brownbackistan were running surpluses with essential services humming along, the governor would probably be fending off rumors of a 2016 presidential run. Instead, he is locked in a tight race with the House Minority Leader Paul Davis, who led Brownback by 6 points in a recent SurveyUSA poll and has been endorsed by more than 100 current and former Republican officials. Last week, the Cook Political Report moved the November contest from a likely Republican win to a pure toss-up.\n\nWint Winter, a former state senator who has known Brownback since he was 14, is one of the Republicans backing Davis.\n\n\u201cI had hoped that it wouldn\u2019t be as extreme as it\u2019s been,\u201d Winter told The Daily Beast of Brownback\u2019s tenure. \u201cI knew from Sam\u2019s time in the Senate that he had a passionate affection for social issues, but what we didn't know was that Sam would use this state as crash test dummies for his own fiscal experiments. We have people in our group who are moved by different issues, but all of them come back to the fact that Sam did not have the right to use Kansas as an experiment.\u201d\n\nThe experiment that Winter referred to is a sweeping income tax cut plan that Brownback enacted in 2011, which eliminated income taxes for small businesses, cut the highest income tax rates by 25 percent, and made smaller cuts for people with lower rates. Brownback has also signed bills cutting state budgets, declared that life begins \u201cat fertilization,\u201d and created an \u201cOffice of the Repealer\u201d to eliminate state laws, regulations and agencies. He\u2019s also ended guaranteed teacher tenure, and narrowed eligibility for welfare and Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThere are three parties in Kansas\u2014the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, and the Brownback Party.\u201d\n\nThe tax cuts have come at a particularly steep price. The Wall Street Journal reported that tax collections fell by $685 million in the first 11 months of the fiscal year, putting Kansas on track to blow through its $700 million reserve fund by the middle of next year.\n\nBrownback has insisted that he\u2019ll make up future shortfalls with economic growth, but with 40 percent of state revenue traditionally coming from those taxes and no specific plan to make up the shortfall, Moody\u2019s Investor Service recently downgraded the state\u2019s debt rating. In their decision, Moody\u2019s cited both the tax cuts and a state Supreme Court decision that found that Brownback and the legislature had cut funding for schools unfairly and too deeply in 2011, and would have to find budget savings elsewhere.\n\nIn 2011, Jim Yonally, another former Republican state legislator backing Davis, started Traditional Republicans for Common Sense, a group of more than 70 current and former GOP officials, when he said he saw Brownback taking the state in what Yonelly thought was the wrong direction.\n\n\u201cI'm really disturbed by continued reduction in funding for education in Kansas,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a poor boy who grew up on a farm in Kansas but was able to scrape enough together to get a college degree. Today if a kid has enough money to go to college, he almost has enough money to start a business and do without school. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good for our state.\u201d\n\nPolling shows that the education question is hurting Brownback the most. For the plurality of voters who list education as their top issue in the SurveyUSA poll, Brownback loses to Davis 73 percent to 19 percent. That same poll showed one in four registered Republicans defecting to Davis.\n\nWhile Brownback has technically increased money spent on education, the increases have gone to legally required obligations to shore up the state\u2019s teacher retirement system. Per-pupil funding has fallen and cuts in local schools have alarmed teachers and parents. The Wichita Eagle reported that individual schools have eliminated everything from high school librarians to kindergarten activity funding to janitor positions, leaving some teachers to vacuum their classrooms after recess.\n\nDespite the cuts and complaints, Brownback told MSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd he has no regrets over the tax cuts and promised to \u201chit the accelerator\u201d on more of the same kinds of policies in a second term. \u201cIt's really starting to work the way we hoped it would,\u201d Brownback said.\n\nAbove and beyond his policies, a final piece of Brownback\u2019s tenure that could come back to haunt him in November was a decision to campaign against moderate Republican legislators in 2012. The result has been what local politicians call a \u201ccleansing\u201d of the existing Republican ranks, and an all-out battle within the state among Tea Party Republicans and the older school moderates.\n\n\u201cTo say the there's a split in the Republican Party is to give the banana split a bad name,\u201d said Winter. \u201cThere are three parties in Kansas- the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, and the Brownback Party. He has in effect created his own party.\u201d\n\nBetween the looming budget shortfall, the education cuts, the Republican family feud, and an ongoing FBI investigation into former Brownback loyalists, the Cook Political Report\u2019s Jennifer Duffy says that Brownback is weighed down in a year that he should be winning easily.\n\n\u201cKansas is probably the last state I thought I\u2019d put in the toss-up column,\u201d Duffy told the Beast. \u201cIt's not about the political environment, it's not about the political landscape, it's about Brownback and the actions he took.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:55.059+0000"}
{"entityId": 1854, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The handshake between corporate and religious conservatives has sustained the GOP for decades. Are the corporatists changing sides?\n\nThe Republican governor of that reddest of red states, Arkansas, just refused to sign the anti-gay Religious Freedom Restoration law his Republican legislature produced. Wal-Mart, the second-largest employer in the state (after the government itself), told him not to. This would be newsworthy in itself.\n\nEven more important than this victory is that it is the first real crack in the deal that built the Republican revival of the last nearly 40 years: secular capitalists and religious fundamentalists agreeing on the marriage of free-market economics and a conservative religious social order.\n\nAs early as the mid 1970s, secular conservatives like Howard Phillips and Richard Viguerie consciously undertook to make a coalition with the religious right and succeeded beyond all imagining. Sincere or not, each party agreed to embrace the others\u2019 agenda, and they began to win elections. Probably nothing has been more central to the movement\u2014and the Republican Party\u2019s\u2014success than the stability of that deal. Much evidence suggests that neither faction really embraces its partners\u2019 programs. But sincerity is not the currency of electoral politics. As long as the two parts of the Republican machine held together, progressive politics did not stand a chance.\n\nNo one represents the fruits of that electoral bargain better than the players in Arkansas: religious fundamentalists behind the last-ditch defense against LGBT victory in the name of \u201creligious freedom\u201d on the one hand and the lowest of low-wage employers, Wal-Mart, on the other. This week it cracked wide open. Deliciously, the breach happened at the behest of the LGBT movement, a tiny minority, underfunded, and still often closeted. Wal-Mart told the religious freedom crew to stop the restoration.\n\nThe Arkansas Moment may have taken some by surprise, but it was completely predictable. In 2012, former Solicitor General Paul Clement, a leading partner in the uber-establishment law firm King & Spalding, agreed to represent the Republican House of Representatives in fighting for the Defense of Marriage Act in the Supreme Court. By the time the firm\u2019s largest client (Coca-Cola) called to ask King & Spalding what they could have been thinking, LGBT operatives were already preparing a law school campaign to ensure that K&S would never again hire a desirable young associate. Days later, management magically found that Clement had not followed the proper procedure when he agreed to take the case. The ink was still wet on the Human Rights Campaign signs (\u201cShame on you King & Spalding\u201d) when Clement quit his job.\n\nAs early as the mid 1970s, secular conservatives like Howard Phillips and Richard Viguerie consciously undertook to make a coalition with the religious right and succeeded beyond all imagining.\n\nHow did the LGBT movement achieve the great progressive triumph? Victory has a thousand parents.\n\nImportantly, a thousand fathers. No. 1, gay people are increasingly mainstreamed into corporate America. Sure, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook was nominally in the closet, but as he even acknowledged in coming out recently, everyone knew. And still he rose. He was not alone. Many American companies have LGBT employee affinity groups, and many of those employees occupy critical positions in their businesses. They are the business manifestation of the old Gay Liberation motto, \u201cJust come out!\u201d The flipping of the business community is a particular example of the impact of people coming out in all parts of life. But once the mostly male LGBT people scaled the ramparts of rampant capitalism, their presence turned the force of the market actors against their old conservative ally.\n\nTwo, relentless, brilliant management of the new political weapon of social media and the bottom-up threat of real boycotts. Katie Blair, the young, savvy advocacy coordinator at the Indiana ACLU, has a communications degree from the University of Missouri. Within days of Indiana moving on the RFRA, the hashtag #boycottIndiana was trending on Twitter. Arkansas happens to be the home state of activist Chad Griffin, president of the largest LGBT organization, the Human Rights Campaign. As soon as the RFRA action moved to Arkansas, pictures of Chad\u2019s mother demonstrating against the law went viral on the Internet.\n\nSome economic institutions are fragile, as the panic at King & Spalding reflected. Southern-based, family-owned businesses like Chick-fil-A might be able to resist a gay boycott, but most institutions seek a broader market. Fragile, low-wage Arkansas isn\u2019t California. It doesn\u2019t have a million employers. They need customers, and, like King & Spalding, they need people to want to work for them.\n\nThird and maybe most importantly, the LGBT movement has conquered the moral high ground. Once, the religious had an iron grip on the moral high ground. Religion was for most of human history the source of most moral teaching. Initially, only the religious right used moral arguments\u2014\u201clife\u201d against \u201cconvenience\u201d for women seeking abortions, \u201cfamily,\u201d \u201cdefense\u201d of marriage. But in time the marriage equality activists took a moral stance in favor of love and commitment in the marriage arena. Now the gay revolutionaries have broadened the argument in the most ambitious way. It\u2019s \u201cdiscrimination\u201d that\u2019s immoral again in America. Anti-discrimination is the new moral high ground.\n\nYou can see it in the statements the businesses put out. They aren\u2019t saying, although it is true and is not shameful, that they are looking after the bottom line. They see themselves as noble defenders of right and justice. As Arne Sorenson, president of Marriott Hotels, put it: \u201cThe law is not just pure idiocy from a business perspective\u2026 to discriminate against people just because of who they are, it\u2019s madness.\u201d\n\nNow of course it is possible that the Republicans can patch the alliance together again. They\u2019ve done it before. Attention will lag. But the religionists have gone more and more to their corner of the culture and business has spread more and more to every corner of the culture. With every move, the gap widens. The LGBT movement saw it happening and is exploiting it brilliantly.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:55.331+0000"}
{"entityId": 1855, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "If he\u2019s going to make it through the wilderness of the GOP primaries, the libertarian senator is going to need guides with faith. He may have found them.\n\nIn early July, Rand Paul went shopping in the graveyard of Rick Santorum\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign. In a move that signaled to a narrative-hungry press that the Kentucky Senator was gearing up for 2016, he hired Mike Biundo, a New Hampshire native who served as Santorum\u2019s campaign manager, to be the chief strategist in New England for his political action committee, RANDPAC. Just a few weeks later, Paul returned to Santorum\u2019s ruins, and brought back with him John Yob\u2014head of national convention and delegate operations for the former Pennsylvania Senator\u2014who he named national political director and the leader of his Michigan operations at RANDPAC.\n\nIn the last election, Santorum was the Republican of choice for the evangelical establishment. Santorum spoke like a pastor and did not seem to fully buy into the concept of a separation of church and state. He believed that America was under attack by \u201cthe Father of Lies\u201d (Satan) and compared homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality.\n\nIn Christ-fearing Republican Iowa, he won the caucus, edging out Mitt Romney\u2014who, having been pro-choice early in his career and perceived as soft on marriage, was not an easy sell to social conservatives. But by the time Evangelical leaders formally decided to throw their collective weight behind Santorum, in January 2012 (the result of a closed-door meeting in Texas, reportedly consisting of over 100 Christian conservatives), his opportunity to win was gone\u2014Romney had taken too many steps toward the nomination to be knocked down.\n\nA smart strategy for someone hoping to run for president in 2016, whose name may or may not be Rand Paul, would be to figure out\u2014early\u2014how to effectively court the evangelical vote. And hiring some of the architects of Santorum\u2019s campaign would surely be a meaningful part of such a strategy.\n\nFor Paul, whose faith was questioned during his first political campaign four short years ago, being welcomed into arms of the evangelical base (which some believe was not tapped to its full potential the last cycle) may require some extra effort.\n\nWith just a few months until election day in 2010, a bomb dropped on Paul\u2019s Senate campaign: GQ reported that while at the Baptist Baylor University in Waco, Texas, Paul was part of a secret society called the NoZe Brothers, a group who, in the words of a former member \u201c'aspired to blasphemy.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe publication detailed that the NoZe Brothers \u201cwould perform \u2018Christian\u2019 songs like \u2018Rock Around the Cross'\u201d and \u201cparade around campus carrying a giant picture of Anita Bryant with a large hole cut out of her mouth after the former beauty queen proclaimed oral sex sinful.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps most damaging of all was the retelling of an act of humiliation on a female student. She told the publication that Paul and another NoZe brother tied her up and tried to make her take bong hits, and then drove out to the Waco countryside, where they blindfolded her and \u201c\u2019told me their god was \u2018Aqua Buddha\u2019 and that I needed to bow down and worship him\u2026I had to say, I worship you Aqua Buddha, I worship you.\u2019\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s opponent, Democrat Jack Conway, capitalized on the bad press with an attack ad that was almost a parody of an attack ad. \u201cWhy was Rand Paul a member of a secret society that that called the Holy Bible \u2018a hoax,\u2019 that was banned for mocking Christianity and Christ?\u201d The ad\u2019s narrator asked. \u201cWhy did Rand Paul once tie a woman up, tell her to bow down before a false idol and say his God was \u2018Aqua Buddha\u2019? Why does Rand Paul now want to end all federal faith-based initiatives? and even end deductions for religious charities? Why are there so many questions about Rand Paul?\u201d\n\nPaul employed his wife, a deacon in their Bowling Green presbyterian church, for damage control. In a press conference, Kelly Paul called the ad \u201ca desperate, shameful attack on our family\u2026I could hardly believe my eyes when I first saw it, and neither could our three sons, who are ages 11, 14, and 17. Rand and I are both Christians and our faith is very important to us.\u201d\n\nOnce in the Senate, Paul began making uneasy attempts to discuss his faith.\n\nIn 2012, he spoke at the Family Research Council\u2019s Values Voter Summit\u2014an annual social conservative confab, where he detailed his struggles with religion: \u201cMy faith has never been easy for me. Never been easy to talk about and never been without obstacles.\u201d Paul said he struggled to understand \u201chow tragedy could occur in a world that has purpose and design.\u201d Borrowing language from his father, Paul said he does not wear his religion \u201con my sleeve.\u201d\n\nIt was refreshingly candid, but not necessarily theologically sound or comforting to Christian voters. \u201cThe presidential stage is not one that lends itself to candidates who aren\u2019t real sure about their faith,\u201d Hogan Gidley, former communications director for Rick Santorum\u2019s campaign, told me.\n\nPaul, along with Senator Ted Cruz, met privately with Christian leaders at the conference. Gidley explained he was curious what social conservative kingmakers like Bob Vander Plaats, the CEO of The Family Leader, would make of Paul after talking to him one-on-one. \u201cI remember, when they came out of the meeting, I said, \u2018How\u2019d he do?\u2019 and he said, \u2018Rand Paul wouldn\u2019t answer the marriage question.\u2019\u201d\n\nPaul is seen as being solid on the issue of life. He is opposed to abortion even in cases of rape and incest (but has said that in cases where the life of the mother is at risk, exceptions can be made). But, he believes that marriage should be decided at the state level\u2014\"soft,\u201d if you\u2019re a social conservative. \u201cHe\u2019ll be able to placate concerns from some Christians,\u201d Gidley said. \u201cBut on fundamental issues like marriage, that\u2019s going to be more difficult to do.\u201d\n\nIn the time since his shaky speech and that meeting, Paul has found a way to discuss faith that both distracts from marriage and seems more comfortable for him: by weaving it into political issues he is already passionate about.\n\nWhen Paul returned to the Summit in 2013 (following a social conservative credibility-boosting trip to Israel) he honed in on a message about Christian persecution. \u201cI want to tell you about a war the mainstream media is ignoring. From Boston to Zanzibar, there is a worldwide war on Christianity,\u201d he confidently declared. \u201cThe President tries to gloss over who is attacking and killing Christians,\u201d he charged, noting that \u201cthe answer is not convenient and does not fit the narrative we have been told about radical Islam.\u201d\n\nHe said a minority of Muslims were committed to violence against Christians and \u201cunfortunately, that minority is in the tens of millions\u2026American tax dollars should never be spent to prop up a war on Christianity, but that is what is happening right now.\u201d\n\nPaul has also been a vocal leader on prison reform, which has the benefit of being attractive to both fiscal and social conservatives, since focusing on rehabilitation over incarceration saves money as well as provides a chance at redemption. Paul has united with New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat, to introduce legislation which will overhaul the criminal justice system, and give nonviolent offenders a chance to break the \u201ccycle of poverty and incarceration,\u201d Paul said.\n\nPaul has to master the delicate balance of appealing to the libertarians who make up his base of supporters and to the evangelical voters who could ultimately dictate the fate of the primary\u2014and to what degree there is overlap between the Liberty and the evangelical movements could be what makes or breaks Paul.\n\n\u201cI think the evangelical vote is up for grabs,\u201d Biundo, the former Santorum aide now working for Paul, told me. \u201cI think there\u2019s a symbiotic relationship between the liberty movement and those who you would consider to be evangelicals, and a lot of those folks carry the same beliefs on each side\u2026I think you will see some convergence.\u201d\n\nGidley wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cYou've got to have some certainties in life. And the Christian voter\u2014the certainty they have is that God is God of All. He\u2019s the beginning, he\u2019s the end, he\u2019s alpha, he\u2019s omega, and he is sovereign. So, to be wishy washy on that fundamental principle\u2014and I\u2019m not saying that he is\u2014but to be wishy washy on a fundamental tenet of Christianity could pose some problems for him.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:55.467+0000"}

Is that what a nation with epidemic levels of murder needs?\n\nWith new information available that our gun culture costs us the lives of nearly two children per week--70 percent of those deaths preventable--and the National Rifle Association doing everything it can to make sure stalkers and those who've committed domestic violence still have access to ready weaponry with which to kill you, it sure is good know Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan signed legislation dealing with guns.\n\nYes, Snyder reacted to what would be considered a moral and existential crisis in any other high income country by\u2026signing a bill protecting the \"privacy\" of gun owners:\n\nGovernor Rick Snyder on Tuesday signed into law an NRA pack of bills giving gun owners more privacy. These new laws make fire arms records like licensing, registration and concealed carry permitting -- information once accessible by requests under the Freedom of Information Act -- now completely confidential. The information is available only to law enforcement for investigative purposes.\n\nBecause if the last few months, or years, or decades have taught Rick Snyder anything, it's that gun owners are the real victims to be protected in our society.\n\nGun down classrooms full of six and seven-years olds, well, we'd better have a long, hard and inane debate about whether Billy Bob's right to carry an assault weapon into a church--one that he got from a private seller at the local gun show who had no idea whether or not he's done time for murder--is being improperly maligned by enacting universal background checks. But some small newspaper in suburban New York decides to publish a list of gun owners in your neighborhood and Holy Moses we'd better baton down the hatches!\n\nIn this case, lest the persecuted gun owners of the Michigan feel a speck less than safe under the bed in their panic room, Snyder was able to read them exactly the bedtime story that should alleviate the fear that if your neighbor knows you're packing heat he might\u2026what exactly? This is the United States of America, where your average block is better armed than ISIS.\n\nI'd honestly like to know what it is these tough guys open-carrying at a Target near you think is going to happen when we find out they're armed in their home too. Doesn't the NRA--and your average gun nut on a rolling basis--shout ad nauseam about how when choosing to commit mass murder, your basic nutcase sits down to closely analyze a color-coded map of gun-free zones so he/she can strike?\n\nIf that were true--and far be it from me to ever accuse the NRA and their dedicated worshippers among America's favorite high school heroes of telling an untruth--shouldn't gun owners want people to know that their houses are not gun-free zones? Also, while we're on this topic, why does the guy or gal who chooses to play urban cowboy once again get their \"rights\" prioritized over those of the rest of us, who might want to avoid walking in front of that particular house containing mass ordnance? Or not live next to that special brand of genius who goes all in on the gun-cleaning with ammo in the chamber?\n\nAs I've asked before, is my constitutional right to have the \"general welfare' of my family protected by my government once again taking a backseat to the trumped-up, Ron Paul newsletter's-greatest-hits being spouted by local members of the Dirty Dozen fantasy club?\n\nAlso, not shockingly, if you'e familiar with the NRA's war against information, from studies done on their product to what your doctor or commanding officer can tell you to what information the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms can access, there is this little tidbit tucked into the bill:\n\n\u201cThe information will still be available to law enforcement officials for certain purposes, though there are new restrictions on when police can access the records.\u201d\n\nWell by all means let's create more red tape for police, because it's not like they're being executed as we pay very-special attention to the \"rights\" of guys who spend time on Cliven Bundy's A-Team over the lives of our peace officers and other first responders.\n\nOf course, the irony of all of this is that these guys would be the first to want to be notified if former child molesters were living on their street. They aren't so big on the privacy thing then. And you know what, in that case I agree with them.\n\nBecause sometimes the safety of our families, outweighs your privacy, if we can be harmed by it.

{"entityId": 1857, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Despite a disappointing ruling in the Fifth Circuit on Thursday, the pro-choice movement is only gearing up for battle.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit gave a victory to anti-abortion advocates Thursday and as a result, pro-choice Texas is refusing to cave into Rick Perry and co.\n\nJudge Edith H. Jones wrote in the three-judge panel ruling that the state law requiring all abortion providers to meet the standards of ambulatory surgery centers (ACS) did not cause an \u201cundue burden on the life and health of a woman.\u201d\n\nThe stipulation, which means a physician performing an abortion must have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles, will not take effect until September, but since the law was enacted, a third of Texas\u2019 abortion clinics have shut down. There are currently 19 centers providing abortions for a population of 26 million.\n\nGretchen Borschelt, senior counsel at the National Women\u2019s Law Center and director of state reproductive health policy, says the ruling was hardly shocking based on the circuit\u2019s history. \u201cThe Fifth Circuit is a notoriously conservative circuit and had already indicated it was going to uphold the law,\u201d she says.\n\nBorschelt believes that the Fifth Circuit offered a \u201ctroubling analysis\u201d of what constitutes undue burden on women.\n\n\u201cAs tasked by the Supreme Court, you look at how the women who will be affected [by the law] will, in fact, be impacted,\u201d she explains, regardless of whether a minority or majority of women comprise the affected group. However, since the Fifth Circuit is under the impression that \"the majority of Texas women will not be affected,\" the court discounted the \"undue burden\" on the minority of women.\n\nThe clinics have already begun to notice the ramifications of the new state abortion restrictions\u2014and it\u2019s not fewer abortions.\n\nAnother problematic aspect about the ruling was that unlike previous court decisions, the Fifth Circuit was \u201cnot interested in looking at the burden on low-income and/or rural women,\u201d says Borschelt. She also noted that in contrast to courts that have analyzed similar abortion laws in Mississippi, Wisconsin, and North Dakota, the Fifth Circuit took state legislators' claims that the law was meant to protect the health of women at face value. \u201cCourts in other cases have looked at that, and they find there is no truth to these claims about women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the ruling, however, the pro-choice movement in Texas is completely undeterred in their efforts to provide abortions access. Mara Posada, Planned Parenthood South Texas\u2019 spokeswoman, said, \u201cWe were disappointed, but not entirely surprised by the ruling.\u201d In fact, Planned Parenthood is moving ahead and adapting to cope with the more stringent regulations.\n\nBy the time the ACS regulation is set to take effect in September, Planned Parenthood is expected to open a new facility in San Antonio that will cater to women who will have to travel hundreds of miles to get an abortion. \u201cAlready in the Rio Grande valley or West Texas where there are no longer providers, women have to take time off of work, find means of travel, find care for their kids, to get an abortion,\u201d she says.\n\nWhile the new facility will alleviate some of the hurdles for those seeking abortion access, women of the most rural and southern regions will still face struggles, says Posada. \u201cA women from McAllen is a 250-mile drive to san Antonio to get the healthcare she needs.\u201d\n\nThe clinics have already begun to notice the ramifications of the new state abortion restrictions\u2014and it\u2019s not fewer abortions. \u201cAnecdotally, our clinic supervisors see more women coming to see if they are still pregnant,\u201d says Posada. \u201cShe may have taken some pills or some herbal medications. When we hear that, it\u2019s a flag for us that she has already tried to interrupt her pregnancy in a way [that\u2019s] not legally safe.\u201d\n\nOpening the new facility is meant to be a clear message to both anti-abortion advocates and, more importantly, to women in Texas: The pro-choice movement will not back down in the Lone Star State.\n\n\u201cWe are going to do what we need to do to be here for our patients,\u201d says Posada. \u201cTheir safety and care is our highest priority. By making this commitment to continue providing service, we are still letting our patients know they can rely on us for what they need.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:55.915+0000"}
{"entityId": 1858, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Voters may care little about what happens overseas, but President Obama\u2019s lack of leadership is destined to leave the world in flames.\n\nThe American public is usually wrong on foreign policy. It takes leadership to understand that, deal with it and still do the right thing.\n\nIn the 2012 presidential race, the Romney campaign, for which I worked as a senior strategist, regularly asked a series of routine questions about issues that mattered most to voters. No doubt the Obama campaign asked similar questions, and I\u2019m sure their findings mirrored ours.\n\nAs an example, here are numbers from a Romney poll taken in mid-October, before the \u201cForeign Policy\u201d debate, the third debate of the general election. It showed results that were fairly constant throughout the election.\n\nWhen voters were asked:\n\nAnd, which ONE of the following issues do you believe should be the top priority for the President and Congress?\n\nEconomic issues like jobs\n\nFiscal issues like the deficit, spending and cutting taxes\n\nForeign policy issues like national security and the war in Afghanistan\n\nPocketbook issues like rising prices, the cost of gasoline and housing\n\nSocial issues like abortion and gay marriage\u201d\n\nThe results broke down as follows:\n\n56% Economic Issues\n\n21% Fiscal issues\n\n6% Foreign policy issues\n\n6% Pocketbook issues\n\n4% Social issues\n\nNot that it wasn\u2019t obvious, but this does help explain why in a \u201cForeign Policy\u201d debate there was a lot of discussion of issues that touched on domestic policy, issues that voters felt more impacted their lives. \u201cTrade\u201d was mentioned 14 times; \u201cterrorism\u201d only four.\n\nLike it or not, Americans today are just not that interested in foreign affairs. In 1964, Pew research showed only 20 percent of the public agreed and 69 percent disagreed with the statement, \u201cThe US should mind its own business and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.\u201d By December 2013, those who disagreed had risen to 52 percent and those who agreed had fallen to 38 percent\u2014a 63-point shift.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an issue that unites Republicans and Democrats, this is it. When asked, \u201cShould the US concentrate more on our national problems rather than international,\u201d the results vary almost none by party: 82 percent of Republicans, 76 percent of Democrats and 79 percent of independents agree.\n\nThe world\u2014and our own conscience\u2014will eventually demand that the U.S. step forward. It always does.\n\nIn a world of increasingly market-based politics\u2014which is just a nicer way of saying that politicians poll a lot today and need to raise vast sums of money\u2014these sorts of numbers offer almost zero incentive for anyone to focus on international affairs. The result is that no one is willing to take risks or lead, because there is no upside to leadership. In short, if it seems like Americans don\u2019t care much about what\u2019s happening in the world\u2026it\u2019s because we don\u2019t. And most of our politicians seem perfectly happy not to care that we don\u2019t care.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here before and it never ends well. Before World War II, there was a wave of anti-immigration sentiment that included even those escaping from the growing European war. In four different polls in 1938 between 71 percent and 85 percent of the public opposed the U.S. accepting more war refuges. Tragically, in May of 1939, Jewish refugees on the ocean liner St. Louis who had escaped from Europe without U.S. visas, were not allowed to dock. After Cuba turned them away, they returned to Amsterdam, which was soon captured by the Nazis.\n\nIn the 1940 presidential election, Republican Wendell Willkie took a more anti-Nazi, interventionist position and was crushed by President Roosevelt. In the run-up to the election, after the start of the war in Europe, Roosevelt was so sensitive to anti-war sentiment that he even framed his efforts to help Great Britain as anti-war. In his appeal for the repeal of provisions of the Neutrality Act that prohibited arms sales to warring countries, he declared: \u201cOur acts must be guided by one single, hardheaded thought\u2014keeping America out of the war.\u201d\n\nWoodrow Wilson was re-elected in 1916 on the slogan \u201cHe Kept Us Out of the War.\u201d But even by his inaugural he was preparing the nation for war: \u201cThere can be no turning back,\u201d he somberly said. \u201cOur own fortunes as a nation are involved whether we would have it so or not.\u201d A few years later, over 320,000 Americans had been killed or wounded in our first European war.\n\nToday President Obama declares that he has \u201cended two wars.\u201d It\u2019s a tellingly U.S.-centered perspective from a president who greatly touted his international life experiences when he ran in 2008. The wars haven\u2019t ended but American troops are out of Iraq and far fewer are in Afghanistan. Our war is ended or is ending. Their war is a horror.\n\nWhat is most remarkable is that while the world seems to be teetering on chaos, no U.S. politician seems eager to step forward and use foreign policy as a path to national leadership. The only exception may be Rand Paul, who seems tempted to withdraw U.S. troops from anywhere their cellphones incur roaming charges.\n\nBelieve me, I know how hard it is to get the public to support unpopular positions. But is this really how Americans see the United States role in the world? We sit at home and watch a dead American lying in a Ukrainian field while our president calls it an \u201coutrageous event,\u201d an odd phrase for mass murder. American and Allied blood liberate vast areas of Iraq from Saddam\u2019s tyranny\u2014we can argue the merits of invasion BUT Saddam was a beast of a dictator\u2014that today are falling under the black flag of Isis. Does anyone really think that Iran is not developing a nuclear weapon? Or that the Taliban is not likely to \u201cwin\u201d in Afghanistan?\n\nThe Obama foreign policy was based on two principles: \u201cA New Beginning\u201d with the Muslim world as he articulated in his June 2009 Cairo speech, and Not Being George W. Bush. The first has gone up in flames, literally, as his VP would say. The second seems as consequential for the next election as JFK running on not being Truman.\n\nThe world\u2014and our own conscience\u2014will eventually demand that the U.S. step forward. It always does. Some horror will be too great, some attack too grievous for us to ignore. But we would all be better served if our politicians put aside the polls and started to do a better job of explaining why U.S. leadership was critical in the world.\n\nSaying what the public wants to hear may be a good way to get votes, but it\u2019s a dangerous way to lead a country and a disastrous way to lead the world. We need more from our leaders\u2014even if sometimes it seems we don\u2019t deserve it.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:57.370+0000"}

Loudspeakers alternated between blasting the country's newly composed national anthem and President Obama\u2019s \u201cYes We Can\u201d speech. For many South Sudanese, the speech, with its references to slaves and abolitionists, resonated at a visceral level.\n\nNow, nineteen months into a new civil war, as President Obama lands in neighboring Kenya, that marketplace and the dream of a peaceful future for the world\u2019s newest country lies in ruin.\n\nMalakal, which sits at the gateway of South Sudan\u2019s remaining productive oil fields, has become the most visible prize of a war that cannot be won through armed combat, yet continues to be fought with increasing ferocity. South Sudan\u2019s warring sides have exchanged control of the town at least 10 times. Malakal\u2019s diverse population has been forced to flee, leaving its market a charred and empty shell.\n\nPresident Obama will not be far from refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia housing tens of thousands of women and children displaced by South Sudan's war.\n\nOver 20,000 people who speak five different languages live huddled together in a little over a half square mile at a UN peacekeeping base. South Sudan\u2019s national anthem, with its pledge to \u201cuphold us in peace and harmony,\u201d has been discarded. The clarion call that \u201cyes we can\u201d represented to so many is being ignored by leaders who used their power to accumulate wealth instead of building a nation.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama will not be far from refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia housing tens of thousands of women and children displaced by South Sudan\u2019s war. He is meeting with two of the heads of state currently mediating South Sudan\u2019s peace efforts and is addressing the African Union on issues of regional security.\n\nTo maximize impact, President Obama should work with South Sudan\u2019s neighbors to dismantle the complex system of corruption and illicit financial flows that are funding and profiting from the conflict in South Sudan. In addition, by making a public commitment to a hybrid court, with international judges, an investigative wing and jurisdiction over economic crimes, President Obama will help combat what has become an accountability-free zone.\n\nThis week, Human Rights Watch published evidence of brutal gang rapes, unlawful killings of civilians, and the deliberate destruction of seeds intended for planting as a part of the South Sudanese government\u2019s recent scorched earth campaign. Previous reports from the UN peacekeeping mission\u2019s human rights division have implicated the armed opposition in cold-blooded massacres at hospitals and mosques. Without clear financial and legal consequences for those directing and fueling atrocities, abuses like these will continue.\n\nPresident Obama can also bring new energy to the UN's multilateral asset freeze and travel ban regime for South Sudan, which recently added six military commanders from the government and opposition to its sanctions list. To build on this momentum, President Obama should encourage his counterparts in the region to ensure asset freezes and travel bans are enforced in their countries and urge them to support a new round of high-level designations against politically influential individuals and their enablers.\n\nIn South Sudan, targeting field commanders alone is ineffective. The country\u2019s political elites who are responsible for the looting of South Sudan\u2019s natural resource wealth, however, are much more vulnerable to international financial pressure. President Obama should also urge regional leaders to support an arms embargo to limit the warring parties\u2019 access to military hardware used to attack civilians.\n\nBeyond this, billions in oil revenues have been stolen from the country\u2019s treasury and stashed abroad. The real leverage over South Sudan's elites will come through a transnational effort to trace, seize, and return these ill-gotten gains to the people of South Sudan. President Obama can jumpstart this effort by urging Kenya and Ethiopia to share intelligence about stolen money. At the same time, he should prioritize support to the Department of Justice\u2019s Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative as it seeks to identify actionable cases of grand corruption from South Sudan with a strong connection to the United States.\n\nFinally, President Obama should use his trip to pressure Kenya and Uganda to adjust their laws to increase transparency about the real owners of corporate assets and trusts. In his public remarks, he could connect the proliferation of shell companies and tax havens in Africa with the broader problem the continent faces with the massive illicit financial outflows, now more than double what Africa receives in foreign aid. A global push for greater ownership transparency, including a strong final rule from the Department of the Treasury in August to implement greater customer due diligence transparency in the United States, will help ensure that sanctions enforcement and asset recovery efforts are not stymied by anonymous companies and opaque business records.\n\nThe hope that filled the South Sudanese at the cusp of independence has been replaced with utter despair at their leaders\u2019 shameless corruption, tit-for-tat scorched earth campaigns, and the looming threat of famine. South Sudan\u2019s citizens are still waiting for their chance to say \u201cyes we can\u201d to the opportunity and prosperity that independence promised. U.S. leadership on anti-corruption efforts and financial consequences targeting those most responsible for the escalating violence can help make that dream less of a distant reality.\n\n\n\nJohn Prendergast and Akshaya Kumar are Founding Director and Policy Analyst at the Enough Project. They have collaborated with George Clooney to launch The Sentry (thesentry.org) this week to track the assets of those perpetrating, funding or profiting from war crimes like those in South Sudan.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:57.897+0000"}

Ted Cruz\u2019s Jesus-huffing father vs Rand Paul\u2019s gold-shilling doomsday dad?\u201d\n\nAmericans are already familiar with Ron Paul\u2019s wild ideas and chin-stroking over his cost-benefit to Rand has been a staple of punditry since Rand first hinted at interest at his own political career.\n\nBut the equally far-from-mainstream opinions of Ted Cruz\u2019s dad, Rafael, are not as familiar to a national audience. But if you haven\u2019t already heard about his Obama conspiracy theories, homophobia or his unusually specific interpretation of Biblical prophecy, don\u2019t fret: Liberal outlets have all put on lobster bibs and staked out space on Rafael\u2019s lawn for what is, in all honesty, probably going to be fantastic television.\n\nYou can already anticipate the pushback to such attacks: They are not their father\u2019s keeper. I would advise the candidates\u2019 offices to draft some fill-in-the-blank press releases (all ending with \u201cdoes not speak for the Senator\u201d) to save time.\n\nThis defense is not just predictable; it has the added advantage of being true. Of course no one is responsible for a family member\u2019s opinions. If everyone in every family agreed on every political issue, then how would we bond with our spouse after Thanksgiving?\n\nThat the Cruzes and the Pauls admittedly endorse each other\u2019s opinions on most issues doesn\u2019t make it any less of a defense. Sure, according to a college friend, Ted\u2019s ideological inclinations were flash-frozen at 18: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing he says today that I didn\u2019t hear in college. It all came from his father and from the Constitutional Corroborators.\u201d\n\nBut I\u2019m willing to believe that he doesn\u2019t agree with his dad that Obama should \u201cgo back to Kenya\u201d (this is, for some reason, the only charge that Cruz\u2019s office has taken an official stance on). I\u2019m also willing to believe that the \u201c99%\u201d of the things Ron and Rand agree on does not include the presumption that Osama bin Laden got a raw deal, or that heroin should be legal.\n\nIf you think it\u2019s even possible that sitting at the knee of Frank Marshall Davis could turn Obama into the Manchurian Candidate, then shouldn\u2019t you care that in the Cruz and Rand households, the ideological indoctrination was intentional, specific, and continued long into adulthood?\n\nBut whatever their differences with their sons, none of those defenses or denials mean Ron Paul and Rafael Cruz opinions shouldn\u2019t matter to the average voter.\n\nWe should care about what Ron Paul and Rafael Cruz believe because, to be frank, young Rand and Ted were not raised like the average voter. Their childhoods and political educations\u2014guided by two fathers of unusually strong opinions and personalities\u2014are mirror images of the Right\u2019s own fantasy about Obama.\n\nThose paranoid fantasies go something like this: Obama was supposedly indoctrinated into virulent anti-colonialism and/or socialism by his father and/or a series of father figures, from the actual Barack Sr. to Frank Marshall Davis to Bill Ayers to Jeremiah Wright. The myth that Obama has a secret ambition to \u201cfundamentally change\u201d the country into a totalitarian dystopia is anchored in the depiction of these men and their dark, conspiratorial theories about the nature of the American project.\n\nGrowing up believing there is pervasive threat laying in wait and a scheme by those in power to keep you down would certainly engender a certain attitude toward government and politics. It\u2019s not the attitude Obama has, however: It\u2019s the one shared by the families Rand and Paul.\n\nThere are few visions of America darker than Ron Paul\u2019s, whose squeaky doomsaying is the stuff of Internet memes. Just this January, he warned that \u201cthe Republic is no more. We now live in a police state,\u201d and both our social security system and foreign policy are \u201call based on lies and ignorance.\u201d\n\nRafael Cruz is marginally cheerier: He believes we live in the end times\u2014but that there will be a great \u201cwealth transfer\u201d in the meantime, brought about by \u201ckings, anointed to take dominion\u201d in various sectors of society. After that, well, Jesus comes back, and that ends badly for a lot of people.\n\nI will stop short of my opposite numbers\u2019 insistence that the politician raised by a father of apocalyptic temperament himself intends to bring his own end to the country.\n\nBut if you think it\u2019s even possible that sitting at the knee of Frank Marshall Davis could turn Obama into the Manchurian Candidate, then shouldn\u2019t you care that in the Cruz and Rand households, the ideological indoctrination was intentional, specific, and continued long into adulthood?\n\nLegends about Obama\u2019s father figures\u2019 influence draw equally from daytime talk-show-level psychological assumptions about Obama\u2019s lack of \u201cclosure\u201d regarding his father and positively postmodern, obsessive textual analysis.\n\nOthers have debunked the specifics of each individual\u2019s overarching influence (see here, here, here); in general, the idea that Obama political ambitions are just a graft from some older generation is hard to believe because Obama has been unprecedentedly transparent about his intellectual development and his search for a father figure. He hasn\u2019t brushed off comparisons and associations, he\u2019s written whole books and given speeches to explain both what he learned from the teachers in his life, and where he split from them.\n\nThis just isn\u2019t what we\u2019ve seen from Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. Senator Cruz still talks \u201cdeep into the night\u201d with his father, and \u201cuses his father for the kind of guidance you\u2019d expect from a consultant.\u201d Senator Paul has been more deliberately distant, in pure physical terms, from his father, but some of Ron Paul\u2019s most disturbing theories peak out from the edges of Rand\u2019s carefully edited image: His invocation of Lysander Spooner, an anti-Lincoln/anti-slavery Civil War-era anarchist, during his 2013 filibuster drew excited attention from Ron Paul diehards. He\u2019s raised the theory that Christianity ought to be enough of a basis for society, without many other laws\u2014\u201c98% percent of us won\u2019t murder people, won\u2019t steal\u201d\u2014a tenet of the same Christian Reconstructionism Rafael Cruz loudly preaches and a long-observed facet of Ron Paul\u2019s worldview.\n\nAgain, the concern is not that the younger Rand and Cruz have belief systems that exactly duplicate their fathers\u2019. The issue is that their beliefs so clearly have roots in those dinner table rants.\n\nTurn the radical socialism of Davis/Ayers/Wright on its head and you get the free market fundamentalism and evangelical paranoia of both Rafael Cruz and Ron Paul. Substitute for a call to revolution against colonial powers, one against big government power. Paul\u2019s version of America-at-the-precipice is less explicitly Biblical than Cruz\u2019s belief in Christian dominionism, but the two share a theory of politics that begs for the same kind of transformative, charismatic leader to save the country from itself.\n\nAnd both fathers think their son is that leader.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:58.102+0000"}

Until this changes, nothing else will.\n\nWhen news came that Gary Peters won the Senate seat for Michigan last midterm, retiring Senator Carl Levin gave his successor a congratulatory speech and a $10 bill stamped with red ink: \u201cNot to be used for buying elections.\u201d\n\nThis declarative buck was stamped by activists from Stamp Stampede to build awareness about money in politics. Levin imparted the bill to Peters with the coinciding proclamation: \u201cYou can\u2019t buy politics.\u201d\n\nThis was truer for Peters than probably for any other candidate in the rest of the country. Peters defeated a Republican opponent who had outspent him by about $2 million. But in the Senate races overall last midterm, 82 percent of the biggest spenders won their elections.\n\nIn total, almost $4 billion pulsated through last year\u2019s elections thanks to well-heeled groups motivated by an increasingly accurate notion that, actually, you can buy politics. The Koch Brothers have already pledged to spend nearly $1 billion on the 2016 presidential election.\n\nPhoto Illustration by Louisa Barnes/The Daily Beast\n\nEver since Supreme Court decisions like Buckley v. Valeo and Citizens United v. FEC, which allowed rich groups to give unlimited amounts of money to influence our elections, we\u2019ve become a government of, by, and for the 1 percent. For the majority of Americans who will never have the $73 million to spare on an election (that\u2019s what billionaire Thomas Steyer racked up on last year\u2019s midterm), the harsh reality of pay-to-play politics is demoralizing. The public trust in our government has never been lower in the history of the United States.\n\nAnd it gets worse. The post-Citizens United Wild West of campaigns and elections has given rise to \u201cscam\u201d PACs. According to a Politico analysis of the last midterm\u2019s financial reports, 33 PACs raised $43 million, mostly from small donations. And $39.5 million of that went to operating expenses and consulting firms owned by the PACs\u2019 own operatives. Less than 10 percent actually went into what they told donors their money would fund.\n\nPoliticians get to Washington indebted to the rich minority of our population, and corporate interest saps public interest on bill after bill.\n\nConservative pundit Erick Erickson criticized these PACs for their harmful deceptiveness: \u201cThe conservative activists feel like they\u2019ve contributed to a cause greater than themselves, but the money goes to the consultants, and eventually the activists get burned out and stop giving money, including to the legitimate causes.\u201d\n\nOur democracy needs to nurture civic engagement and robust debate, not put a price tag on it. We\u2019ve come to a juncture where Democrats and Republicans require millions of dollars in order to have a voice and the small-dollar donors, who try to play the game, get bamboozled.\n\nMoney is the root cause of Washington\u2019s foibles. Politicians get to Washington indebted to the rich minority of our population, and corporate interest saps public interest on bill after bill. Currently, money buys elections, but it shouldn\u2019t. Money should not be buying elections or bribing politicians.\n\nEven if poll after poll shows how the majority of Americans are unhappy about money in politics, Congress can\u2019t seem to come together to represent We the People. There is a reason why over 30,000 citizens are stamping their money like the bill Levin discovered in revolt with the Stampede, a subversive but legal cry of frustration from people who are sick of this vicious cycle.\n\nMillions of people have made reducing money in politics their number one issue due to Congress\u2019s tin ear. The new 114th Congress may have won enough votes to earn a seat in Washington for the next two years, but its members better not confuse their seats with thrones.

Why is the Obama administration trying to bury this material?\n\nScattered around the U.S. Capitol complex are a series of Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facilities, or SCIFs, which are typically used to hold Top Secret information.\n\nBut today in these deeply secure settings are a series of unclassified documents\u2014items dealing with the Iran nuclear deal that are not secret, but that the Obama administration is nevertheless blocking the public from reading.\n\nThe Obama administration delivered 18 documents to Congress on July 19, in accordance with legislation requiring a congressional review of the nuclear deal. Only one of these documents is classified, while the remaining 17 are unclassified.\n\nYet many of these unclassified documents cannot be shared with the public or discussed openly with the press. The protocol for handling these documents, set by the State Department and carried out by Congress, is that these unreleased documents can only be reviewed \u2018in camera\u2019\u2014a Latin term that means only those with special clearance can read them\u2014and must be held in various congressional SCIFs.\n\nMost staffers were hesitant to discuss\u2014let alone share\u2014a number of these documents, even though they\u2019re not classified, because they require security clearances to view. By mixing a classified document with unclassified documents, critics of this arrangement contend, important facts are being kept from the public just as Congress is deciding whether to support or oppose the Iran deal.\n\n\u201cThe unclassified items\u2026 should be public. This is going to be the most important foreign policy decision that this Congress will make,\u201d a Republican Senate aide told The Daily Beast. \u201cThis is the administration that once said it would be the most transparent administration in history. They\u2019re not acting like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany in Congress view the administration\u2019s tactic of co-mingling unclassified documents with classified documents and requiring congressional staffers to have secret clearances just to view certain unclassified documents as an attempt by the administration to limit open debate,\u201d a second senior Republican congressional staffer said.\n\nAmong the 17 unclassified documents are important texts related to the Iran nuclear deal: One document, titled \u201cElements of Iran\u2019s R&D Plan,\u201d is based on the \u201csafeguards confidential plan [between] Iran and the IAEA,\u201d or International Atomic Energy Agency, a State Department official said, and so it can\u2019t be released publicly. The document describes how Iran\u2019s research and development on its nuclear program, including on its centrifuges, could progress over time.\n\nOther unclassified documents may be diplomatically sensitive: One is a letter from the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the U.K. to Secretary of State John Kerry; another is a letter from Kerry to the three foreign ministers and his Chinese counterpart as well.\n\nThe set includes a discussion paper written before the final agreement, on how sanctions would be dealt with in the interim. Yet another is a draft statement by the U.S. government, to be issued on a future Iran deal implementation day.\n\nBloomberg View\u2019s Eli Lake and Josh Rogin previously reported the existence of the 18 documents submitted by the Obama administration to Congress, as well as some descriptions of what the set contained.\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal is unlike other arms control agreements \u201cbecause it\u2019s so complex and has so many moving parts,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. \u201cIt goes into jaw-dropping detail.\u201d So it\u2019s not a complete surprise that there might be some sensitive ancillary documents to go along with the arrangement. Iran might not want the particulars of its nuclear research program in full public view, for instance.\n\nThe unreleased, unclassified documents are informative for Congress but not for public consumption, the State Department contends.\n\n\u201cSome of the documents are the types of documents which, like State Department cables and other internal USG documents, we would not post publicly but would share with Congress in appropriate circumstances. Others are documents that, while not part of the [Iran nuclear agreement] itself, pertain to it and we were clear with the other P5+1 members and Iran that we would be sharing those documents with Congress, and we have,\u201d a State Department official said.\n\nAdded the official, \u201cCongress has every document that we have, and every Member of Congress and every staff [member] with the necessary security clearance can review all of the documents.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats were supportive of the administration\u2019s hush-hush approach. The documents are part of a sensitive diplomatic process involving Iran\u2019s nuclear program, they argue, so it\u2019s not surprising that there are some restrictions to the level of transparency the government will allow.\n\n\u201cThe essential elements to make the decision on the deal are out there,\u201d a senior Democratic aide said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lack of transparency or discussion on [the Iran deal], because you\u2019ve had very detailed briefings and every member of Congress has been able to view these documents\u2026 The way they are stored is consistent and not unreasonable, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything nefarious.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the administration that once said it would be the most transparent administration in history. They\u2019re not acting like it.\u201d\n\nOpen-government advocates, on the other hand, were appalled that unclassified documents this important were being kept both from public view\u2014and, in a real way, from serious congressional scrutiny.\n\n\u201cKeeping unclassified documents in a SCIF is overkill, even if the documents are sensitive or confidential. They simply don\u2019t need the kind of sophisticated protection against clandestine surveillance that SCIFs are intended to provide,\u201d said Steven Aftergood, a senior research analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, working to reduce government secrecy.\n\n\u201cThe primary obstacle to congressional review that is created by this arrangement is the requirement to physically be present in the SCIF. Members of Congress cannot review the material in their offices, or share it with trusted colleagues or with subject matter experts. It is a significant hindrance to review,\u201d he added.\n\nCongress passed a law called the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, also known as Corker-Cardin, requiring the administration to formally submit the Iran nuclear deal, an unclassified verification assessment with any secret annexes, and other relevant materials to Congress.\n\nThe intention of that provision was for unclassified materials to be freely available so that an open debate on the public interest could occur. Members of Congress are pointing out that this is not what is happening\u2014and are urging the Obama administration to allow their release.\n\n\u201cA lot of both documents and discussion that have been held in a classified setting doesn\u2019t have classified characteristics to it\u2026 to the extent that many [documents aren\u2019t classified,] they should be made totally public, as far as I\u2019m concerned, so that the public can evaluate for themselves,\u201d Democratic Senator Bob Menendez told The Daily Beast.\n\nRepublican Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, agrees. His spokesperson told The Daily Beast that Corker \u201cbelieves that the administration should make these unclassified documents available to the public so the American people can see the details of the Iran nuclear deal.\u201d\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by Alexa Corse and Noah Shachtman", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:09:58.534+0000"}

If Uber did actually mislead its customers, it should certainly be held responsible. But Uber\u2019s stature looms so large that its unique controversies also threaten to cast a shadow over the \u201csharing economy\u201d as a whole.\n\nThe rapid rise of the sharing economy is changing the way people around the world commute, shop, vacation, and borrow. Services like Airbnb, Yelp, and yes, Uber are disrupting long-established industries, from taxis to hotels. In the process, the sharing economy is creating new opportunities for those looking for work, and offers consumers greater convenience, better prices, and higher quality.\n\nYou\u2019d think that, despite the actions of a few individuals, policymakers would embrace this pro-consumer movement. Sadly, you\u2019d be wrong.\n\nThe response to the sharing economy from many policymakers in the United States and abroad can be best described as \u201cban first, ask questions later.\u201d Even in Las Vegas\u2014a city where nearly anything goes\u2014consumers are forbidden from taking advantage of the benefits that the sharing economy can bring in the form of Uber and Lyft. And now Portland, Los Angeles, and San Francisco are all suing Uber for refusing to play by their old regulatory playbooks.\n\nDefenders of the status quo claim the old rules protect consumers. But it\u2019s more likely the rules just protect established, politically connected interests. As we detail in a new study published by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, consumers can benefit more from the sharing economy\u2019s better service options than they can from one-size-fits-all \u201cconsumer protection\u201d rules that end up doing very little to benefit consumers.\n\nBeing cautious about how we regulate doesn\u2019t mean that bad actions go unpunished. When companies do bad things they ought to be held accountable for them. But civil and criminal laws are already on the books in all 50 states that give wronged persons the ability to seek recovery against those who are at fault.\n\nThe sharing economy figured out in a matter of weeks a problem that regulators in Nevada could not solve over the course of several decades.\n\nBy regulating entry and limiting competition in certain markets, consumers are often left with less choice, poorer quality service, and very little in increased protection. This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. From Ralph Nader to Nobel Prize-winning economist George Stigler, many realized decades ago that regulators often end up serving the interests of the firms they oversee. This concept is known as \u201cregulatory capture,\u201d and it helps explain the DC Taxicab Commissioner\u2019s assertion that it \u201cdoes not fight with the people it regulates,\u201d but instead acts as referee between competing interests groups. That\u2019s not consumer protection; that\u2019s competitor protection.\n\nThe advent of the sharing economy gives rise to true permissionless innovation by expanding the information available to consumers, and creating strong reputational incentives for firms to improve their level of service.\n\n\n\nThe ban of Uber in Las Vegas reveals the stark reality: As Firefox founder Blake Ross explains, for years authorities have been trying to keep taxis from scamming tourists by taking them the wrong way from the Las Vegas airport to the Vegas Strip. Using the tools available to it, the Nevada Taxicab Authority tried everything from roadside checkpoints to giant signs to creating a system for passengers to submit reports (PDF) when they were taken by the wrong route from the airport. All to no avail. The Taxicab Authority is now planning to create its own software to monitor these trips, which at one time was to be funded by taxing rides in taxis.\n\nIn contrast, the sharing economy figured out in a matter of weeks a problem that regulators in Nevada could not solve over the course of several decades. Through its five-star rating system, Uber is able to determine within an instant whether or not a driver took the passenger the correct route.\n\nIn the name of protecting passengers, however, tourists in Las Vegas are unable to take advantage of this service. Instead they are left with the patchwork of solutions devised by the Taxicab Authority, which isn\u2019t serving them well.\n\nRegardless of how things turn out in Las Vegas, San Francisco, Portland, or any other city facing the questions raised by the rise of the sharing economy, technology will always outpace regulation. And, unfortunately, all too often the response by policymakers is to try to stop the world until they have an opportunity to catch up\u2014or let one bad apple spoil the whole lot. Instead, as new technology or competition strips away the need for some regulations, we should be questioning the rules, not the innovation.\n\nBending the world to fit a regulator\u2019s worldview is simply bad policy and does nothing to help consumers.\n\nAdam Thierer is a senior research fellow with the Technology Policy Program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

Now he\u2019s got some advice for his dejected fellow Democrats.\n\nWhen Dan Malloy was elected governor of Connecticut in 2010, he was the first Democrat to win an open race in the Nutmeg State since 1980. It would have been reasonable to expect, then, something of a cautious approach, one wary of shifting political winds in an otherwise reliably blue state.\n\nInstead, Malloy enacted one of the most ambitiously liberal agendas of any governor in the nation, from higher taxes on the wealthy to a higher minimum wage, guaranteed paid sick leave for workers, protections for gays and immigrants, strict new gun-control laws, looser marijuana-possession laws, allowing the unionization of daycare workers, and outlawing the death penalty.\n\nThe result? A 25,000-vote victory out of more than a million cast in Malloy\u2019s reelection bid against Tom Foley.\n\nNow, having barely survived in a race that was not conceded, Malloy has some advice for his fellow Democrats. But first he wants to clear up a few things.\n\nJason Reed/Reuters\n\n\u201c\u2018Barely?\u2019 Let\u2019s stop with the barely. 6,400 [votes], that was the barely,\u201d he said in an interview, referring to his even squeakier 2010 race, which he won by half a percentage point against Foley. \u201cTwenty-five thousand\u2014that was a landslide!\u201d\n\nIf his fellow Ds want similar results in the wake of a bloodbath of an election that was the 2014 midterms, Malloy says: \u201cThey can\u2019t run as Republicans. Democrats can\u2019t run away from what they have done. If there is a message out there, it is that we failed to embrace our successes because we thought that it would remind people that we are Democrats. Well, guess what? I am a Democrat. And I ran as a Democrat.\u201d\n\nToo many Democrats, in the face of national headwinds, ran as Republican-lite, Malloy said. And now many of those Democrats are heading home after long careers in public life, with some losing easily winnable races.\n\n\u201cThe other people are the people who want to make the rich richer and, quite frankly, if that makes the poor poorer, that is OK with them. And if you don\u2019t point that out, don\u2019t be shocked that people get confused.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I think happened is people underestimated the ability of the voting public to put things in context,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are going to have a contest and it is going to be about who is the grayest, then Democrats lose. But the world is more black and white than it is gray, and if you fail to point that out, then don\u2019t be surprised that you lost.\u201d\n\nIn Connecticut, Malloy was saddled with underwater approval ratings since his first year in office, when he instituted the largest tax increase in state history. As the campaign season heated up, his opponent hammered away on the issue. Malloy was unconcerned, he says.\n\n\u201cI always felt that when we got to a serious contest in October, we would be OK as long as we stayed true to our principles and talked about what we accomplished,\u201d he said. \u201cTom Foley wanted it put out that there we raised taxes. And he talked about it month after month after month after month. But once people started to pay attention, I pointed out what we did with the money, which was lower the crime rate, increase graduation rates, invest in infrastructure, create a Housing Department, create an Energy Department, create a Department of Aging. We did all of these things. It was the right policy, and ultimately people came around.\u201d\n\nDemocrats elsewhere, he says, were scared of making contrasts, of owning up to their record and saying, \u201cThis is why we did what we did.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t point out the difference between who you are and who the other people are,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the other people are the people who drove the economy into the ditch. The other people are the people who want to make the rich richer and, quite frankly, if that makes the poor poorer, that is OK with them. And if you don\u2019t point that out, don\u2019t be shocked that people get confused.\u201d\n\nDuring the campaign, Malloy didn\u2019t just embrace his record and his party. He did what only a few Democrats were willing to do: Embrace Barack Obama. The president headlined a rally in Bridgeport in the days before the election, at a time when other candidates, like Alison Lundergan Grimes of Kentucky, wouldn\u2019t even cop to voting for Obama in his reelection bid.\n\n\u201cI was never going to run away from the president,\u201d Malloy said. \u201cIt was not even in consideration. I support the president. I think the president has been right. I mean, look at the numbers, look at the job growth, sustained job growth\u2014the greatest in American history. The. Greatest. In. American. History. Why didn\u2019t people run on that? So you know that a bunch of political people say, \u2018Well, it is not deep enough, and some people are hurting.\u2019 OK, but talk to the people who have benefited. That is a better way of doing it than the other way.\u201d\n\nWith such tough talk, Malloy should be a leader of the progressive left in much the same way that Elizabeth Warren or Howard Dean is. But the mild-mannered former prosecutor mangles his words too often and has too wooden a persona to have garnered much attention outside Connecticut. Indeed, what probably brought him the most attention in his first term was not at all the legislation he enacted but when he publicly rebuked another governor, Louisiana\u2019s Bobby Jindal, after a meeting of the nation\u2019s governors with Obama at the White House.\n\nThen, Jindal, an unabashed contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, said Obama was waving the white flag of surrender by focusing his economic agenda on raising the minimum wage. Such political statements are not customary after a meeting with the president, and Malloy hit back hard.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the heck was a reference to white flag when it comes to people making $404 a week,\u201d he told the press at a contentious news conference. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s the most insane statement I\u2019ve ever heard, quite frankly.\u201d\n\nMalloy\u2019s plan to eke out a win against the GOP, and against the national tide, was to count on loyal Democrats grateful for what he had done rushing to the polls to support him. It worked, but it was not a last-minute strategy, he insists.\n\n\u201cI made that decision 40 years ago when I became a Democrat,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd if Democrats want to succeed going forward, Malloy suggests they follow his example.\n\n\u201cHave a compass,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then follow it.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:01.099+0000"}

Just hours after watching Rambo endure agonizing electrical torture by Vietnamese captors, Rafael piped up about the scene. It was a rare window into his treatment by the Batista regime.\n\n\u201cYou know, the Cubans weren\u2019t nearly that fancy in their torture methods. They would just come into your jail cell every couple of hours and beat the crap out of you. And then they\u2019d do it again and again,\u201d Rafael Cruz said, according to his son, a Republican senator from Texas and the author of a forthcoming book, A Time for Truth.\n\nRafael Cruz endured savage beatings and bleak conditions: \u201ca rotten cell, acrid with the smell of blood, grime, urine,\u201d the senator writes, according to excerpts of the book obtained by The Daily Beast. \u201cMen with clubs beat him. His captors broke his nose when they kicked him in the head with their army boots. They bashed in his front teeth until they dangled from his mouth.\u201d\n\nRafael never broke under torture, refusing to tell his captors who else he had been working with in the Cuban underground. And somehow, the senator writes, his father survived his captivity.\n\n\u201cHe had heard of too many rebels who had broken and had been shot, with their bodies dumped in the street. That fear kept him from breaking,\u201d Cruz writes. \u201cMy dad, a Cuban immigrant who sometimes seems larger than life, has always been my hero. He has always felt a visceral urgency about politics. Having the right people in office was vitally important to my dad, as if it were a matter of life and death. Because for him, in a very literal sense, it was.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether the hawkish senator\u2019s thinking on enhanced interrogation techniques might be affected by his family\u2019s experience with torture.\n\nWhen The Daily Beast has asked Cruz about the Bush-era interrogation techniques in the past, he hasn\u2019t specifically addressed or condemned them. He has instead responded by condemning torture in general terms, without weighing in on the specific techniques. In his book, the senator refers to Guantanamo Bay naval facility as a \u201crenowned U.S. military outpost.\u201d\n\nBut the Cruz family\u2019s experience with torture has influenced the senator\u2019s thinking on sexual assault. In recent years the Republican has teamed up with Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand for a measure sought by military sexual assault victims\u2019 advocates: to remove the chain of command from decisions about whether sexual assault cases go to trial. Cruz\u2019s activism on sexual assault, which goes back at least to his college days, was inspired by his aunt\u2019s experiences in Cuba.\n\n\u201cWe were in front of a large computer screen gazing at explicit, hard-core pornography. As we examined the screen before us, I remember very distinctly what the sixty-five-year-old O\u2019Connor said.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my own family, my aunt experienced terrible abuse in prison in Cuba, and that made protecting women from assault all the more personal,\u201d the senator told Business Insider in 2014.\n\nCruz addresses his aunt\u2019s abuse in a brief passage in the book\u2014which begins abruptly:\n\n\u201cShe fought against Castro, trying to topple him from power. And, sadly, she too faced prison and torture. Castro\u2019s goons threw Sonia and her two best friends in prison\u2014all of them were teenage girls\u2014and brutalized them. I love my T\u00eda Sonia\u2014she\u2019s a wonderful, passionate, loving person\u2014and we don\u2019t talk about what she experienced in that Cuban jail.\u201d\n\nIf nothing else, Cruz knows how to start a chapter. Writing about his law career, the senator mentions looking at pornography with Supreme Court Justices William Rehnquist and Sandra Day O\u2019Connor.\n\n\u201cWe were in front of a large computer screen gazing at explicit, hard-core pornography. As we examined the screen before us, I remember very distinctly what the sixty-five-year-old O\u2019Connor said,\u201d Cruz writes.\n\nSadly, the excerpt obtained by The Daily Beast doesn\u2019t include the end of that story.\n\nThe first chapter of Cruz\u2019s book is a deep dive into the senator\u2019s family history with a series of fascinating anecdotes. His father was born in the city of Matanzas, which means \u201cmassacre\u201d in Spanish, reflecting the place\u2019s violent past. His grandfather started from humble beginnings, purchasing a fruit stand, graduating to a grocery store\u2014and then losing it by overextending credit to customers. His grandmother faked insanity, screaming nonsense and foaming at the mouth, to get out of indoctrinating students with communist beliefs she opposed.\n\nBut it is in his father\u2019s story that Cruz finds common ground with Barack Obama, a president he has so frequently denounced. The senator writes in great detail about his father\u2019s decision to flee Cuba for Texas, landing with almost nothing and working as a dishwasher at an Austin diner.

{"entityId": 1867, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "In light of their loss in Florida\u2019s special election, Democrats need to adopt a new political approach and emphasize the popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn the wake of Democrat Alex Sink's narrow loss in the special congressional election in Florida, POLITICO, which swiftly and often clearly crystallizes the conventional wisdom, described a \"public split\" among Democrats in \"how to talk about Obamacare.\" A few think candidates should stake out more progressive ground, presumably chastising the party and the president for not passing something like single-payer. Others are cravenly ready to run against the Affordable Care Act. And still others will seek shelter in the strategy that was tried and failed for Sink-- the law shouldn't be repealed, but fixed.\n\n\n\nAll three reactions are tempting, simple, easy \u2013- too much or not enough, and too often just plain wrong.\n\n\n\nTo begin with, Sink didn't lose because of Obamacare. She had a spending advantage, but a demographic disadvantage. Barack Obama barely carried the district in 2012 during a presidential year with high turnout. In the March special, the electorate was depressed, and its composition was decidedly more Republican. Moreover, Sink was not a stellar candidate, even against an opponent who was, of all things, a lobbyist and could have run on the slogan: \"Remove the Middleman.\"\n\n\n\nNor was her core message likely to move Democrats and motivate turnout. Instead it was a pale carbon copy of Obama's 2008 pledge to reach across the aisle, an echo of a moment now long past in politics and in time. \"Bringing Republicans and Democrats together\" was her hallmark phrase.\u201d The phrase may scored well in a poll-- who will say they don't favor it? But bringing the two sides together is by now a clich\u00e9d appeal that doesn't turn out voters.\n\n\n\nAs Karl Rove warned Republicans afterwards, it's dangerous to over \u2013 interpret a special election as a harbinger of midterm elections. He's right, and I don't generally write that. Even more, it's profoundly dangerous for Democrats to draw the conclusion that their only safe choices are to flee left or right on Obamacare \u2013 or just stay stuck in the middle.\n\n\n\nExamine each of those obvious, even desperate options.\n\n\n\nA lurch toward single-payer \u2013-that the mistake was doing too little \u2013- ignores the reality that the Affordable Care Act was the best, or most, the could have been squeezed through Congress \u2013- and then only because of the legislative legerdemain of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who induced her unhappy colleagues to accept the Senate bill after Scott Brown's victory in Massachusetts deprived Senate Democrats of the 60 votes needed to approve an amended version. Beyond this, is there any plausible evidence that the electorate is pining for the farther reach of single-payer? A lot of liberals favor it, and so do I--in principle. But to suddenly campaign for it would pre- concede likely defeat; it wouldn't be a political strategy worthy of the name. It would be a reflexive resort to ideological self-satisfaction. In essence, the argument would be both unconvincing and counterproductive: Elect us because we made a mistake.\n\n\n\nDemocrats who decide to campaign against Obamacare \u2013 we're against it after we were for it \u2013 are headed for at least as rocky a road. Last week, in a different context, I discussed the ahistoricism that infects our politics. And that ahistoricism is rampant here. This kind of swerve has been ventured before and it led to an electoral dead end.\n\nIn 1994, there were Democrats who conspicuously separated themselves from Bill Clinton, unpopular after the defeat of his health reform and plagued by a false perception of economic lethargy that lagged the reality of an accelerating recovery. On Election Day, these turncoats lost nonetheless. A prime example was Tennessee Representative Jim Cooper, who, after scorning Clinton's health plan for a more moderate proposal of his own, went down to a surprising defeat.\n\n\n\nSeveral of the Democrats who survived \u2013 Chuck Robb in Virginia and Edward Kennedy, who faced the hardest race of his career against Mitt Romney \u2013 rejected the expedient of running against what they had previously supported. Robb, in a far more conservative era, in a state still more red than blue, not only refused to back away from his support for gays in the military; he openly and repeatedly defended it.\n\n\n\nIf the question this year is: Who's against Obama and Obamacare? Voters will prefer the real Republican to the ersatz one. That's what occurred in 1994. And perhaps with the exception of a few districts or a state or two, Democrats won't prosper, or survive, in 2014 by offering a choice between two Republican parties.\n\n\n\nThe third suggested alternative on Obamacare reprises Clinton's \"mend it, don't end it\" position on affirmative action; but he didn't campaign on that. It was fundamentally a defensive position. So too, without the benefit of a rhyme, is \"fix it, don't repeal it.\" The public does agree with that position now, 64% to 34%, according to the latest Bloomberg poll. And the formulation will do okay as a debate answer, but not as the heart of a candidate's message and media, especially when the poll also shows that the opponents have the advantage of intensity.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have to stop allowing Republicans to define the election as an up or down vote on an abstraction called Obamacare. Instead of running away from health reform, they have to run on it -\u2013 in the right way. The key is to denominate the choice in terms of specific provisions of the law, which are overwhelmingly popular in survey after survey.\n\n\n\nPound away at a Republican candidate for proposing, and a Republican House incumbent for voting 51 times, to permit insurance companies to deny coverage for pre- existing conditions; 65% of Americans disagree with that in the Bloomberg data. Assail Republicans for opposing a ban on lifetime limits, so policies can't be canceled when patients are sickest and need them most; 53% of Americans support the ban. And go after Republicans for favoring or voting for a bill to deprive children up to the age of 26 of the chance to stay on their parents' health insurance policy. Here Democrats are in sync with 73% of the country.\n\n\n\nEven the individual mandate elicits just narrow disapproval, 51% to 47%. Democrats can defend it, but it's imperative to go on offense by recognizing and actualizing the reality that the parts of health reform are more powerful politically than its sum.\n\n\n\nNowhere is this clearer than in the red battleground of Kentucky, where Governor Steve Beshear has defied Republicans as he relentlessly enrolls his citizens in Obamacare. As Election Day nears, Allison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic challenger, can attack Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell for plotting to abolish health coverage for 20% to 25% of the electorate. The race is close now, one of the closest in the nation.\n\n\n\nRepublicans like McConnell may discover that they're running the 2010 midterm four years too late. Or as Ted Cruz let slip during his faux filibuster, Republicans won't be able to repeal Obamacare once Americans are \"addicted\" to it. That's an ugly word to apply to a basic human right to health and life; but Cruz spoke, or misspoke, a basic truth.\n\n\n\nObamacare's numbers are getting better and better \u2013 in both public opinion and enrollments. Democrats have the specifics on their side. What they most have to fear is their own wimpiness \u2013-or miscalculation. It would be self-delusion of the first order to assume health reform won't be a central issue in 2014. Democrats can't slink away, or crouch, or cut and run against their own record. But they can recast the contours of the contest; they can meet voters where they already are.\n\n\n\nAt times, strategy is necessity. This is a classic case of that. The best politics here is to be principled, nimble, and shrewd. The only way to win now is to be worthy of winning. As Ted Kennedy often said, \"A great political party has to stand for something.\" Democrats have to recapture the midterm debate on health care by saying in concrete terms what they stand for \u2013 and Republicans stand against.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:02.279+0000"}
{"entityId": 1868, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The President looks like he\u2019ll stand up to the GOP on immigration and Keystone in the coming week. But is it all too little, too late?\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s final two years don\u2019t officially begin until January, but in reality the last phase of his presidency starts this coming week, with the much-anticipated battles over immigration and the Keystone XL pipeline. On both, he\u2019s going to stand up to the Republicans, it appears. And the Republicans are going to go ballistic, especially on immigration. We\u2019re going to start hearing the I-word from some of them, as indeed we have already.\n\nThings may or may not reach the point of impeachment, but we can be sure of this much: The Republicans are going to react by saying something like, \u201cThis proves the President has no intention of working with us, has total disregard and contempt for the electorate that just spoke, and it removes from us any obligation to work with him on anything.\u201d I guess they\u2019ll add \u201calthough we will of course place good, pro-jobs legislation before him for the good of the American people,\u201d because they have to say that and because a certain percentage of Americans is actually naive enough to believe it.\n\nIt will be the baldest hypocrisy; and I really can\u2019t wait to hear these people, who truly did show spitting contempt for the electorates of 2008 and 2012, start lecturing Obama on that point. But it may well work. And it\u2019ll work in part because the White House, and Democrats generally, haven\u2019t been effective in framing either of these issues, especially the immigration one. What should they have done?\n\nHere is the central fact of the immigration bill: It could have passed the House of Representatives, and probably easily, at any time since the Senate passed it in June 2013. Virtually or literally every Democrat would have voted for it (180 or so); and there\u2019s no question that at least 40 Republicans would have, too. The Chamber of Commerce and some major evangelical groups back the bill, as do many of the party\u2019s major donors, who are understandably giddy at the prospect of more cheap labor flowing into the country.\n\nThe bill has its flaws of course, but it\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen in Washington in many, many years: a genuinely bipartisan response on a major issue. The left gets its path to citizenship, which is the only real-world solution when you\u2019re talking about 12 million people, the vast majority of whom are (even though they came illegally) now law-abiding and hard-working people once ensconced; and the right gets (yes, it does) heightened border security. Nobody truly loves it, but nobody ever truly loves big compromise legislation. It is, however, how Washington is supposed to function.\n\nSo there are, or were, plenty of Republican votes for it in the House. In fact the GOP pro-reform votes would likely have been closer to 80, maybe even 100, than 40. So it could have passed\u2014no, would have passed\u2014by somewhere in the 260-175 range. Other observers may have a lower number of \u201cyeas\u201d, but trust me, no person from either party speaking honestly would tell you that it would have failed. And Obama would have long since signed comprehensive immigration reform into law.\n\nJust watch: I predict polls will come out in two weeks\u2019 time showing that majorities or pluralities put more blame for the mess on Obama than Congress.\n\nSo if it had the votes, why didn\u2019t it come up for a vote? Well, because it had the votes! The Republicans simply can\u2019t give Obama a victory of any sort. But also: Because most of the votes for it would have been Democratic. Yes, this is our old friend the \u201cHastert Rule\u201d\u2014a Republican speaker can\u2019t bring any matter to the floor unless it has a majority of Republican votes. The red-hots in the House are holding a constant knife to John Boehner\u2019s you-know-what\u2019s, and he is afraid of them, and so a bill that passed the Senate by more than two-to-one (68-32) and would have passed the House by something not too far from that was left lying on the floor. And when this session of Congress ends, the Senate version dies, so the Senate will have to go back and do it all over again. Try holding your breath waiting for that, especially with the new more conservative Senate that will be seated on January 3.\n\nSo here\u2019s the reality. It\u2019s been 16 months, nearly 500 days, since the Senate passed the bill. The House could have passed it on any one of those days. But Boehner and the Republicans refused, completely out of cowardice and to spite Obama. Insanely irresponsible. And on top of that, Boehner told Obama in June that he was not going to allow a vote on it all year. In other words, the Speaker told the President (both of whom knew the bill had the votes) that he was not only going to refuse to have a vote, but that he was going to let the Senate bill die.\n\nAnd now, when Obama wants to try to do something about the issue that\u2019s actually far, far more modest than the bill would have been, he\u2019s the irresponsible one? It\u2019s grounds for impeachment?\n\nIt\u2019s mind-boggling (except, you know, what\u2019s mind-boggling at this point?). And yet, this will be the media frame: \u201cObama throws stink bomb.\u201d And that is partly the Democrats\u2019 fault, because what percentage of Americans even knows that the House could have and would have passed this bill at any time? I\u2019d guess maybe 20 percent tops. And it could be more like 5 percent.\n\nThe White House and the DNC and all of them should have been out there pounding this every day. \u201cDay 216. Where\u2019s the Vote?\u201d \u201cDay 217. Where\u2019s the Vote?\u201d \u201cDay 218...\u201d And so on. There was a little of this among Latino advocacy groups, but they lacked the money and juice to bang this fact through the skull of a majority of Americans.\n\nAnd if that majority of Americans were walking into next week armed with that knowledge, I think the debate we\u2019re about to have would be playing out much more encouragingly than it actually will. Just watch: I predict polls will come out in two weeks\u2019 time showing that majorities or pluralities put more blame for the mess on Obama than Congress. And those polls will be a reasonable reflection of what Americans have\u2014and have not\u2014been told about the situation by the two parties.\n\nAs for Keystone, Obama talked some smack in Myanmar, making the case that the project was not a big job creator, that it wouldn\u2019t lower Americans\u2019 gas prices in any meaningful way, and that it would mostly benefit Canada.\n\nHe was very good\u2014but again, why haven\u2019t he and the Democrats been saying this for months? Then at least the American public would have been getting an alternate theory of the case about Keystone. As it is, all most people know is: Keystone. Jobs. Pesky environmentalists. Obama sides with the latter.\n\nAnd here\u2019s another thing the White House might have been doing on Keystone, and it proves yet another point about this ridiculous Congress of ours. The President could have been sending strong signals for months that said, \u201cOkay, you want Keystone, maybe I\u2019ll give you Keystone; but what are you gonna give me?\u201d That\u2019s politics. It\u2019s a fine old game, when it\u2019s done well by both sides, and that is how it\u2019s played.\n\nBut today\u2019s Republicans don\u2019t play that way. Their idea of a \u201cnegotiation\u201d is not \u201cyou give us Keystone, we\u2019ll give you a few green-energy programs and tax credits.\u201d Their idea of a negotiation is, \u201cyou give us Keystone, and we won\u2019t impeach you.\u201d Or \u201cyou give us Keystone, and we may refrain from throwing the world financial markets into turmoil.\u201d There\u2019s very little point in Obama even trying to deal with them.\n\nThey\u2019re going to be a slog, these next two years. And unless the Democrats get a lot better at putting their arguments out there, it\u2019s going to be a slog that may well end with most Americans thinking that the inaction is Obama\u2019s fault and they might just as well go ahead and elect a Republican president to go along with the Republican Congress. That\u2019s a tactical war the Democrats must not lose.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:02.546+0000"}
{"entityId": 1869, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "As speculation about the Massachusetts senator\u2019s presidential ambitions swells, her biggest donors have one thing to say: There\u2019s no way on earth they\u2019re backing her over Hillary Clinton.\n\nShe \u201clit up\u201d a gathering of liberal activists earlier this month with a barn-burner of a speech calling on Democrats to push back hard as thousands of attendees waved signs and chanted \u201cRun, Liz, Run!\u201d Her every denial that she will not run for president is parsed down to the verb tense for evidence that the door is open even a crack. She embarked on the kind of nationwide book tour that candidates-in-waiting always do as they drum up interest for a potential bid, and a \u201cReady for Elizabeth\u201d draft movement is preparing to launch satellite chapters in states and cities around the country.\n\n\n\nBut if Elizabeth Warren does in fact reverse her repeated denials of interest and decides to run for president, she will have to do so virtually alone. That\u2019s because almost to a person, her earliest and most devoted backers do not want her to challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cIf Elizabeth called me up and said, \u2018I am thinking of running for president,\u2019 I would say, \u2018Elizabeth, are you out of your goddamn mind?\u2019\u201d said one New York-based donor who has hosted Warren in his living room. \u201cI really like Elizabeth, but if Hillary is in the race it just makes no sense.\u201d\n\nThis conversation was echoed again and again in more than a dozen interviews with big-ticket Democratic donors in Warren\u2019s hometown of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in cities that operate as ATMs for the Democratic money machine, like New York, Washington, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Over and over again, the message was the same: Stay in the Senate, Liz, stay in the Senate.\n\nThere are many reasons why Warren would want to mount a campaign. The primary animating force of her political career\u2014that the economy is unfairly tilted toward the rich, and that the Wall Street banks are rigging the game\u2014has struck a chord with the activist wing of her party. And that same activist wing doesn\u2019t believe that Hillary Clinton, with her six-figure speeches to Goldman Sachs and her ties to the triangulating policies of her husband, can carry that banner for them. Warren has become a top Democratic surrogate in red states like Kentucky and West Virginia, and in races across the country, \u201cThe Warren Wing\u201d appears to be on the march.\n\n\u201cThere is a rising economic populist tide in America, and Elizabeth Warren is the personification of that tide,\u201d said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has been organizing to make sure every presidential candidate is asked whether they agree with Warren. \u201cIn the Democratic Party there is a battle between the economic populist wing that fights for the little guy against the corporate wing, and she represents the populist wing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Elizabeth called me up and said, \u2018I am thinking of running for president,\u2019 I would say, \u2018Elizabeth, are you out of your goddamn mind?\u2019\u201d\n\nWere she to run, Warren would face enormous challenges, mainly in that Hillary Clinton remains historically popular with Democrats. But the fact that the network of Democratic insiders who helped Warren raise a record $42 million for her 2012 Senate bid want her to stand down in deference to Clinton should all but end speculation that she will be a candidate.\n\n\u201cI think she is outstanding. She is articulate. She is persuasive. She can hit a piece of bullshit from a hundred yards away,\u201d said Victor A. Kovner, a Manhattan lawyer who hosted Warren for a fundraiser way back in 2011. But, he added, \u201cI will be supporting Hillary in 2016. No question about that.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats who say they support Hillary still want Warren in the race, under the theory that it will give a platform to Warren\u2019s ideas on the economy that she cannot achieve while serving as one of 100 senators.\n\nBut Kovner, echoing other members of the Democratic donor class, rejects this view. \u201cPeople should run to win,\u201d he said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t run to have a voice. That is what Herman Cain did.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, the world of Warren-backers isn\u2019t entirely ready for Hillary, and some are holding out hope that the Massachusetts senator joins the race.\n\n\u201cI think it would be very good if she were the nominee,\u201d said Marc Weiss, a tech entrepreneur who helped fund a nascent Warren for Senate campaign soon after she announced. \u201cShe is closer to my views on almost every issue. I would be very enthusiastic if she decided to run.\u201d\n\nClinton, Weiss said, was a good senator and secretary of state, but \u201cthe problem I have with her is as a potential president is that she is too comfortable with many of the forces that are with Wall Street. It is hard to see how she would really be a voice for the middle class.\u201d\n\nErica Sagrans, the campaign manager at Ready for Warren, dismissed the notion that Warren would struggle to raise money if her fundraising network went with Clinton. \u201cShe has proven to be a pretty successful fundraiser for herself and for other candidates. I don\u2019t see that as being a huge challenge for her should she run.\u201d\n\nThere is an argument to be made that a Warren candidacy would benefit Clinton, even if the former secretary of state prevailed at the end. It would, for one thing, give the Democratic Party a primary worth watching, at a time when much of the action appears to be on the Republican side\u2014and Democrats who remember 2008 can recall how galvanizing that campaign was for the party. Democrats maintain a sizeable demographic advantage, and the GOP appears as if it may be on the verge of making the same mistakes it made in the clownish 2012 nominating process.\n\nBut few of Warren\u2019s biggest supporters want to risk it.\n\n\u201cI am not sure what value it would bring to have her run,\u201d said Wayne Shields, CEO of the Association for Reproductive Health Professionals, who, along with Warren\u2019s husband, hosted Warren at his house earlier in her Senate candidacy. \u201cShe would be such a target for conservatives, it may end up having a paradoxical effect on Democrats.\u201d\n\nOne Massachusetts Democrat, who helped lay the groundwork for Warren\u2019s Senate run back when Warren was a Harvard professor mostly known as a thwarted nominee to the newly created Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, agreed:\n\n\u201cIf she ran, it would tear apart the Democratic base even worse than Hillary and Obama did. Whoever is pushing this is not doing the Democratic Party any favors, and I wish it would stop.\u201d\n\nThat feeling, and it is one echoed in other conversations among the donor class, is that a Warren run would expose divisions in the Democratic Party\u2014between, in Adam Green\u2019s words, the populist and the corporate wings\u2014that have lain largely dormant on the national level as Democrats fear a Tea Party-controlled executive branch.\n\n\u201cIt would galvanize a part of the left, and then the question becomes, how do you keep them motivated for a general election?\u201d said one Warren donor. \u201cShe is a fresh face. She would get a lot of attention, which could hurt Hillary.\u201d\n\nIf Hillary decided not to run, even Warren\u2019s most devoted supporters doubt that she could win the presidency.\n\n\u201cIf Hillary comes out tomorrow and says, \u2018I\u2019m not running,\u2019 obviously, this becomes a difference question, but I still think she shouldn\u2019t run,\u201d said one New York-based financial supporter. \u201cShe has so many holes in her resume. Even Obama had more experience than she does.\u201d\n\nAdded another California-based donor who has given thousands of dollars to Warren\u2019s political action committee, PAC for a Level Playing Field, \u201cI don\u2019t think she would be a very good president. Two years ago she was a college professor, for goodness sakes. She has one issue and she is a great advocate for that one issue. She doesn\u2019t have the breadth of experience necessary to be president.\u201d\n\nAnd even those who say they would be the first to line up behind a Warren candidacy say that part of them hopes she doesn\u2019t do it. \u201cOf course I would be with her,\u201d said one Massachusetts Democrat who was one of Warren\u2019s earliest supporters. \u201cBut this is Ted Kennedy\u2019s seat. We know what can be accomplished in a long Senate career\u2014it is almost as much as can be accomplished in the White House.\u201d\n\nMost of the Democratic donors interviewed for this article were quick to point out that at that moment this is largely an academic discussion. Warren has said repeatedly\u2014and in some cases to these donors personally\u2014that she is not running for president. Those who have spoken to Warren recently say that she seems quite content in the Senate, and they doubt that she is ready to give up her life to run for president.\n\n\u201cI hear the chatter, but I also hear what Elizabeth Warren is saying, and she has been pretty firm in answer to that question,\u201d said Dennis Mehiel, a New York-based donor who hosted Warren early on in her Senate campaign.\n\nAnd if the answer to that question ever changed?\n\n\u201cI love Elizabeth. But I go back a very long way with Hillary.\u201d\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:02.817+0000"}

At times frightening, Risen\u2019s book is a strong reminder of the importance of a free press keeping a powerful government in check.\n\nHere are some of the juiciest bits.\n\nThere are billions of unaccounted dollars stashed in Lebanon.\n\nOne of the more exciting undisclosed stories Risen uncovered concerns missing billions that includes both money appropriated by the U.S. and Iraqi funds seized by the U.S. and repurposed for \u201crebuilding\u201d Iraq. According to Risen, at least $11.7 billion of the roughly $20 billion the Coalition Provisional Authority (the organization headed by Paul Bremer in charge of rebuilding Iraq) sent to Iraq under Bush remains unaccounted for.\n\nOne case in particular became the focus of Stuart Bowen, Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. Nicknamed \u201cBrick Tracker,\u201d the case involved a tip Bowen received in 2010 about missing billions in cash that had turned up in Lebanon. According to Bowen and his investigators, roughly $1.2 to $1.6 billion in missing cash and $200 million in gold is sitting there, and according to Risen's sources; some of it is slowly being used to buy weapons for supporters of various Iraqi political parties. However, when Bowen met with officials in the CIA that year, the CIA mysteriously refused to offer assistance for tracking down the money. He was then blocked from going to Lebanon by the U.S. ambassador, and the FBI also refused to investigate. The reason, according to Risen, is that the Obama administration wanted to move on from Iraq.\n\nIronically, the one figure who did seem interested in the funds was former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who asked Bowen about the funds in 2013.\n\nThe U.S. government is easily tricked.\n\nIn the heady rush to take the fight to the terrorists, agencies scrambled to make sure they had a piece of the gravy train. As a result of all that eagerness, Risen argues, the U.S. was hustled by more than a few con artists.\n\nThe most ridiculous character in Pay Any Price may be Dennis Montgomery, who is described as an inveterate gambler and swindler. Montgomery gets his star turn when his facial recognition and code-breaking \u201ctechnology\u201d caught the eye of the CIA. According to Risen, the agency in its eagerness to make up for 9/11 and the WMD intelligence failures fell hard for Montgomery\u2019s non-existent tech. According to the book, Montgomery and the CIA became obsessed with the idea that al Qaeda was putting coded messages into Al Jazeera broadcasts about potential attacks. Armed with purported intelligence from Montgomery\u2019s software, then CIA Director George Tenet went to President Bush, who subsequently ordered commercial flights grounded around Christmas in 2003, and the administration even considered shooting down commercial planes over the Atlantic.\n\nIt was actually the French (after Air France flights were grounded) who figured out that Montgomery\u2019s intelligence was fraudulent. Nevertheless, even after he was exposed, Montgomery continued to get contracts through various government agencies well into the Obama era. The man in charge of distributing Montgomery\u2019s intelligence, according to Risen, was none other than current CIA Director John Brennan.\n\nWhistleblowers are treated horribly.\n\nWhile Risen certainly is not impartial when it comes to leaks and whistleblowers, he offers up the story of Diane Roark as an example of what happens when somebody tries to go the appropriate routes (as opposed to Edward Snowden) when they see government abuse.\n\nRoark was a staffer on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and focused on NSA oversight. At the turn of the century, she became a thorn in the agency\u2019s side thanks to her belief that the NSA was too slow, antiquated, and insular to adapt to the new post-Internet world. However, after 9/11, Roark was approached by former members of the NSA about a new program designed to spy on American citizens (something the NSA was explicitly forbidden to do). Roark wrote memos to the Republican and Democratic staff directors on the committee, Tim Sample and Mike Sheehy, respectively, detailing what she thought was a potentially unconstitutional program. Sample reportedly told her \u201cto drop the matter\u201d and not discuss it with anybody else. She then met with contacts of hers in the various branches of government, only to find out they already knew and were keeping it hushed. She even approached U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, unaware that she was the one who had signed off on the program, and who also then reported her to the Justice Department. Stifled at every turn, Roark retired.\n\nYears later, as the government was attempting to hunt down leakers about the NSA program after Risen published the story in 2005, government agents raided Roark\u2019s house and threatened her with perjury charges as she was battling cancer, even though it turned out she was not the one who talked to the press.\n\nShady characters won government contracts.\n\nIn a section titled \u201cThe New Oligarchs,\u201d Risen sheds light on some of the individuals who have gotten fabulously rich off the war on terror. One of those is Neal Blue, the co-owner and CEO of General Atomics, the company that makes the Predator and Reaper drones.\n\nHowever, according to Risen, a uranium mining firm owned by Blue and his brother has for decades been the target of a series of investigations about radioactive pollution on Indian land, leaks from a uranium mine in Colorado, and contract rigging.\n\nThe NSA once had qualms about what it now does.\n\nThin Thread, an in-house NSA program designed for data collection and analysis, was rejected by the NSA in the late \u201990s. Apparently, the agency\u2019s lawyers said it would violate the law because it would be \u201ccollecting too much data on U.S. citizens.\u201d\n\nNSA Director Michael Hayden allegedly defended warrantless wiretapping saying, the government \u201chad the power.\u201d\n\nWhen Diane Roark met with then-NSA Director Michael Hayden in July of 2002, according to Risen, Hayden defended domestic warrantless data collection against American citizens. When she asked why the protections for citizens were removed, according to her notes, Hayden responded by saying that \u201cthey didn\u2019t need them because they had the power.\u201d\n\nThe Bush White House planned to use domestic surveillance for more than counterterrorism.\n\nAccording to Roark, when she met with Hayden, he seemed to imply that the only reason the spying program was not being used for anything beyond counterterrorism was because the then-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Nancy Pelosi, had repeatedly objected. \u201cIn other words,\u201d writes Risen, \u201cthe Bush administration and NSA eventually wanted to use the domestic spying program for purposes that had nothing to do with the global war on terror.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:03.055+0000"}

She grew up learning that hospitality is key in that business. That\u2019s why she is a leading voice, along with many other business owners, chefs and CEOs, in the fight against Arkansas\u2019s Religious Freedom Act, which Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson sent back to the legislature on Wednesday to make changes so the bill mirrors federal law.\n\n\u201cLocal independent restaurants all realized early on that we create hospitality for everyone,\u201d Peck said. \u201cWe serve and treat everyone whether they are our employees or customers like they are guests in our home. This bill strikes at the very nerve of what our business is about.\u201d\n\nThis week, Leo\u2019s Greek Castle, a restaurant in Little Rock\u2019s artsy Hillcrest neighborhood, posted on their Facebook page: \u201cIf House Bill 1228 isn\u2019t vetoed, we will exercise our newfound right to refuse service to bigots, homophobes, and racists.\u201d\n\nDave and Ray\u2019s Downtown Diner near the state capitol posted a sign in its restaurant that quoted Mark 12:31: \u201cLove thy neighbor as thyself\u2026\u201d and added, \u201cWe do not discriminate. All are welcome!\u201d\n\nThe controversy around the bill, which is similar to Indiana\u2019s, has left many Arkansans exasperated and angry, and some have called it a modern-day Civil War. As Hutchinson said in his news conference on Wednesday, \u201cIt has divided families and there is clearly a generational gap. My son Seth signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill. It shows that there is a generational difference on these opinions.\u201d\n\nHis nephew, Jeremy Hutchinson, a Republican state senator and the governor\u2019s nephew, voted against the bill last week. He was the only Republican in the Senate to do so.\n\nJanine Parry, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville and Arkansas Poll director, said that Hutchinson is right.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely generational,\u201d Parry said. \u201cData in Arkansas look much like nationwide samples: the younger people are, the more supportive they are of gay rights.\u201d\n\nStill, regardless of a generational shift, in the Bible Belt, homosexuality can have major consequences.\n\n\u201cArkansas LGBTQ youth face a multitude of risks, from hostile home environments to schools where the bully is often school personnel,\u201d said Kat Crisp, interim director of the Center for Artistic Revolution, the state\u2019s oldest LGBTQ-centric organization and the only drop-in center for LGBTQ youth. \u201cThe bullying that LGBTQ youth endure does not stop when they graduate from high school, as they go out into a world where it is legal to refuse to employ and fire them, refuse housing and access to public accommodations. A law like HB1228 emboldens those who would like to use their religious preferences to discriminate against LGBTQ Arkansans.\u201d\n\nHarold Hughes, a gay activist, said he has been told that he is going to hell because he has lobbied for LGBTQ people to be included in church. He said just a couple of years ago activists had to assist a lesbian couple after they were pulled over for a routine traffic stop. One woman was jailed on \u201ca trumped-up, resisting-arrest charge,\u201d Hughes said.\n\n\u201cThe police housed her with male prisoners,\u201d he said.\n\nJoining the small-business rebellion in urban Little Rock, corporations such as Acxiom and Walmart, chambers of commerce and mayors have also urged Hutchinson to consider the possible economic fallout from such a bill. Numerous protests in recent days throughout the state have called on Hutchinson to veto the bill.\n\nHowever, in Arkansas, it only takes a simple majority in both legislative chambers to override the veto. Both are controlled by Republicans. It is unlikely that legislators from Hutchinson\u2019s own party would have voted to override him, but anything is possible, said Jay Barth, a political science professor at Hendrix College.\n\n\u201cIn Arkansas, the veto power is formally a very weak one with only a simple majority of each house needed to overturn it,\u201d Barth said. \u201cHowever, Arkansas governors in the modern era have rarely been overturned by legislatures controlled by their party.\u201d\n\nSeveral Republican legislators attended Hutchinson\u2019s news conference on Wednesday. Barth said that\u2019s a good sign toward an amended bill.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the visibility of the legislative leaders this morning was so important as the governor attempts to develop a legislative fix,\u201d Barth said.\n\nThat fix, however, has a long way to go. A vote to recall the bill must pass both legislative chambers. If a recall fails, Hutchinson would have five days to veto it. If he does nothing, it will become law. If he vetoes it, the legislature has 30 days to override the veto, and that could happen when the legislature returns for one day in May to tidy up loose ends. The legislature could adjourn this week.\n\nWhile some Democrats praised Hutchinson on Wednesday for seeking balance, others have little trust in him.\n\n\u201cGovernor Hutchinson has shown a lack of trust with Arkansans when it comes to this bill,\u201d Candace Martin, executive director of the Democratic Party of Arkansas, said. \u201cFirst, he said he would sign it into law and that it didn\u2019t promote discrimination, even though it did. Now, he\u2019s asked for clarification with amendments but didn\u2019t specify what amendments he would like to see made. His lack of courage on this bill has given Arkansas families and business leaders reason to doubt his leadership when it comes to laws that promote discrimination.\u201d\n\nActivists aren\u2019t giving up. Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign and a native Arkansan, spoke on the capitol steps after Hutchinson\u2019s press conference.\n\n\u201cWe have to double down on our efforts and hold them accountable. \u2026 You have to continue to speak out,\u201d Griffin told hundreds of people who attended the afternoon event. \u201cAt the end of the day we will win this battle, but it is a long road ahead.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:04.894+0000"}

But when it comes to Hopes and Dreams and Everyday Americans, she sounds like latter-day Bruce Springsteen.\n\nOn his 2009 album Working on a Dream he sang of the \u201cQueen of the Supermarket\u201d who bags his groceries amid the \u201caisles and aisles of dreams.\u201d You get the feeling, listening to the song, that Springsteen, however noble his intention to pay tribute to the average worker, has probably not set foot in a supermarket in a very, very long time.\n\nLikewise Clinton uneasily meditated on the plight of \u201cthe single mom\u201d but it wasn\u2019t clear if this was one particular mom or a composite of many moms or just the proverbial single mom, or \u201cthe grandmother\u201d who provides child care but can\u2019t live on her paycheck, or \u201cthe young entrepreneur\u201d who wants to buy a bowling alley, or the \u201cmillions of hardworking Americans [who] tell similar stories.\u201d\n\nIn preparation for today\u2019s speech, Clinton and her aides reportedly spent months consulting with over 200 domestic policy advisers, including Neera Tanden, an adviser for her 2008 White House bid, and two former Obama Administration aides: Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein.\n\nStanding in front of 12 American flags at a Hillaryclinton.com-stamped lectern, Clinton spent 45 minutes making a series of ambitious policy promises to the packed West Village auditorium: higher incomes for the middle class through a change to the tax code to incentivize companies to \u201cshare profits with their employees\u201d; the appointment of harsher bank regulators; \u201cbreaking down barriers\u201d to get more Americans\u2014\u201cespecially women\u201d\u2014into the workforce; increased investment in clean renewable energy; \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d; and the reining in of \u201cexcessive risks on Wall Street.\u201d\n\nClinton uneasily meditated on the plight of \u201cthe single mom\u201d who she talked to, but it wasn\u2019t clear if this was one particular mom or a composite of many moms or just a proverbial single mom.\n\nClinton\u2019s economic philosophy is preventive rather than prescriptive.\n\nShe criticized short-term fixes for financial woes and decried a business environment which emphasizes end-of-quarter numbers rather than overall health.\n\nClinton focused her fire at the Republican field, hitting Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, and Jeb Bush by name, and tearing into trickle-down policies which, she claimed, have consistently led to disasters that Democrats, including her husband, have been forced to bail the country out of. Her Democratic rivals went unacknowledged, but traces of their influence were everywhere.\n\nShe borrowed the Howard Beale rallying cries of Elizabeth Warren and her left-wing primary rival Bernie Sanders, but adapted them to fit her tamer message. (In May, when The New Yorker asked Warren if Clinton was co-opting her message, Warren responded, \u201cEh.\u201d)\n\nWhereas Warren declares \u201cthe game rigged,\u201d Clinton said (as she has since her April announcement) that families feel \u201cthe deck is stacked.\u201d\n\nAnd the Sanders line, \u201cIf a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist,\u201d was edited to say the regulators she appoints will \u201cunderstand that too big to fail is still too big a problem.\u201d\n\nWarren and Sanders have called for jail time for big bank CEOs who helped cause the financial crisis. Clinton tiptoed up to that line and then ran away scared.\n\n\u201cWhile institutions have paid large fines and, in some cases, admitted guilt,\u201d Clinton said, \u201ctoo often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences or none at all, even when they\u2019ve already pocketed the gains.\u201d She continued, \u201cThis is wrong, and on my watch it will change.\u201d How?

{"entityId": 1873, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Kentucky senator was supposed to herald a newly dovish GOP. But with Putin pushing westward and ISIS on the loose, will anyone buy what he\u2019s selling?\n\nThe world, it seems, has gotten in the way of Senator Rand Paul\u2019s worldview.\n\nPaul is slated to deliver a \u201cbig speech\u201d on foreign policy in mid-October at the National Defense University. Unusually for the media-hungry Kentucky Republican, however, the address will be off-the-record and closed to the public, according to Defense News. But that won\u2019t lessen the press corps\u2019 interest in what he has to say.\n\nPaul has long been a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, and his minimalist (he abhors the term \u201cisolationist\u201d) foreign policy was initially a big hit with GOP primary voters. His opposition to President Obama on the use of drone strikes, for instance, made him a folk hero not only to the libertarian wing of the GOP, but with many anti-war Democrats as well.\n\nFor a while, this approach to foreign affairs polled well. Americans were tired with the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the broader Bush foreign policy legacy, and Paul was considered by many to be a breath of fresh air.\n\nYet the Kentucky Republican\u2019s honeymoon with the electorate may already be over. A horrible concatenation of global events has reawakened Americans to the perils of a smaller American footprint in the world, a consequence of the retrenched global posture advocated by Paul. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the rise of ISIS and its grisly beheading of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and the resumption of hostilities between Hamas and Israel are just three events that have made this annus horribilis one we\u2019d like to forget. Gone are the days of President Barack Obama\u2019s vow, proclaimed in the well of the United Nations General Assembly, that the \u201ctide of war is receding.\u201d Or White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest\u2019s laughable assertion that the administration has \u201csubstantially improved\u2026the tranquility of the global community.\u201d\n\nAs with Pearl Harbor in 1941, the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979, or the terrorist attacks of 9/11, it often takes cataclysmic events to wake Americans up to the dangers of disengagement.\n\nAt the beginning of his administration, even as his overall job approval rating began to sink after the initial euphoria marking the inauguration of a new president, Americans\u2019 approval of Obama\u2019s foreign policy rose to just under 60 percent. Yet since the beginning of this year, it has fallen precipitously and, in the words of Nate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight, \u201chas shown no signs of recovering.\u201d\n\nThe problem, as many Americans have come to realize, is the president\u2019s lackadaisical approach to world affairs. Merely stating that a particular uncooperative foreign leader stands \u201con the wrong side of history\u201d or that \u201cthe future is won by those who build\u201d won\u2019t stop Putin from annexing eastern Ukraine or ISIS from constructing its caliphate. As such, Americans, and Republicans in particular, are becoming more interventionist in their foreign policy preferences. This is a trend that does not augur well for a Paul candidacy.\n\nA Pew Research Center poll released late last month finds that \u201ca large majority of Americans think the world is a more dangerous place than it was several years ago,\u201d precisely the opposite of what Obama has been telling them. Meanwhile, a majority\u201454 percent\u2014say that the president\u2019s foreign policy is \u201cnot tough enough.\u201d\n\nAmong Republicans, this disappointment has translated into what looks like a renewed fondness for interventionism. Forty-six percent of GOPers now say that the United States is doing \u201ctoo little\u201d to solve the world\u2019s problems, up from just 18 percent less than a year ago. Meanwhile, only 37 percent of Republicans think the U.S. does \u201ctoo much,\u201d a figure that was at 52 percent.\n\nSo much, then, for the growing isolationist sentiment among Republicans that had so many pundits declaring Rand Paul the \u201cnew face\u201d of the GOP. They pointed to a Pew poll conducted late last year reporting a record high number of Americans agreeing with the sentiment that the U.S. \u201cshould mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.\u201d The truth is that, far from the caricature that many around the world have of us as bloody-minded imperialists, most Americans want their country to keep a healthy distance from the chaos of world events. Paul was adept at tapping into this natural impulse.\n\nYet American minimalism, isolationism, realism, mind-our-own-business-ism\u2014whatever you want to call it\u2014is cyclical. As with Pearl Harbor in 1941, the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979, or the terrorist attacks of 9/11, it often takes cataclysmic events to wake Americans up to the dangers of disengagement. For some four decades, the GOP has been the party for national security hawks. With this fact in mind, it was always difficult to see how the Paul boomlet would be translatable into securing the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nAs the world reverts to its normal, chaotic state, suddenly the Paul worldview doesn\u2019t look so appetizing\u2014that is, when one can even discern what Paul believes. In a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, he essentially repeated Syrian regime propaganda by stating that it was American \u201cinterventionists\u201d who had \u201cabetted\u201d the rise of the Islamic State by advocating for a firmer stand against the murderous Bashar al-Assad.\n\nHow these policymakers, far off in Washington, can be blamed for the outcome of a policy that was never implemented, is something Paul left unsaid. In reality, Assad deliberately left ISIS alone so as to let it decimate his moderate opposition and confront the West with the very false choice\u2014the regime or Islamic State\u2014that non-interventionists like Paul now present as justification for American inaction. But now Paul is singing a different tune, in a switcheroo noticed by Reason magazine\u2019s Jacob Sullum, a libertarian sympathetic to Paul.\n\nTwo days after publishing the Journal op-ed, Paul expressed doubt about whether ISIS posed a \u201cthreat\u201d to the United States during a Q&A in Dallas. And yet, later that very evening, Paul seemed to have reversed himself, telling the Associated Press that, if he were president, he would \u201ccall a joint session of Congress\u201d and \u201clay out the reasoning of why ISIS is a threat to our national security and seek congressional authorization to destroy ISIS militarily.\u201d\n\nMaybe Rand Paul has found his inner hawk. Or maybe he just has no clue what he\u2019s talking about.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:05.373+0000"}

Especially when it is raining. It means \u201carmored to the maximum\u201d which is exactly what\u2019s required of the 26-plus cars in a motorcade carrying the president of the United States through Rome\u2019s narrow, cobbled streets. But it does inspire some of the Romans\u2019 favorite words, like \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d and \u201cChe palle,\u201d which, loosely translated, means \u201cthat sucks.\u201d\n\nBut if there\u2019s a city left in the world where people still get really excited about an Obama visit, this is it. Enthusiastic crowds greeted him wherever and whenever they had the chance. It\u2019s just that traffic snarled so badly, many got stuck far from the scene.\n\nObama\u2019s 36-hour Roman adventure began Wednesday night when the arrival of Air Force One halted air traffic to Rome\u2019s Fiumicino airport and blocked vehicle traffic into the city for more than an hour just at the moment when many people were traveling home from work. A chilly spring rainstorm complete with hail and strong winds did little to ease the mood.\n\nAmerican presidents usually fly into the Pratica di Mare military base outside the city, but because preparations were underway for the 91st anniversary celebration of Italian military aeronautics, starting Friday, it wasn\u2019t feasible to host the president\u2019s fleet. Instead his planes\u2014all three of them\u2014parked in a hangar in the cargo section of Rome\u2019s primary airport, which means regular cargo planes that use that space had to be relocated, and so on in a domino effect of confusion and congestion.\n\nOther members of the American delegation, including Secretary of State John Kerry, used Rome\u2019s secondary airport, Ciampino, as their travel hub, which disrupted service for discount carriers who normally use those facilities.\n\nRome has been preparing for the \u201cRobama\u201d visit for weeks. The greenery around the US Ambassador\u2019s lush Villa Taverna near Villa Borghese, where the president and his delegation are staying, has been clipped into curious shapes as part of some security enhancement. The potholes and loose cobbles on the city streets used by the presidential motorcade were all filled as well, much to the ire of everyday Romans who\u2019d like some of the same service on their roads.\n\n\u201cI still like him. He is courageous and I\u2019m really glad he is here.\u201d\n\nAt least two posh restaurants in the city center were swept and secured and their reservations cleared in the event the president gets a hankering for some pasta. Rumors that he might dash off to Montepulciano for a wine tasting at a former ambassador\u2019s villa remained just that, but a baker named Angelo Bisconti from Salento in southern Italy brought a van with the president\u2019s picture painted on the side and 5,000 \u201cObama biscuits\u201d to the Via Veneto to celebrate the occasion. The chocolate cookies have been a big seller for the baker. \u201cI\u2019ve got a tray for the president set aside in case I can get to him,\u201d Bisconti said as he gave away biscuits near the American Embassy. \u201cI love Obama.\u201d\n\nThe Italian press fixated on the details of how the American president travels. Headlines like \u201c200 Agents and a Taste Tester!\u201d and \u201cThe Coliseum Closed For Obama\u201d dominated Thursday\u2019s papers. The president made a special request to visit the ancient Roman amphitheater, which is largely covered in scaffolding because Diego Daella Valle, the founder of the company that makes Tod\u2019s shoes, is paying to restore it. Whether Obama will walk away in trendy moccasins remains to be seen.\n\nTourists who were planning to visit the Coliseum and the Roman Forum on Thursday afternoon were disappointed to find the entire archeological park closed, snipers positioned on the Palatine Hill and secret service agents shooing visitors away. Canadian students on a school trip as stood behind the red and white barriers blocking them from getting near the monument and rendered a familiar verdict, this time in English. \u201cThis sucks,\u201d they said.\n\nBut at the end of the day the Romans themselves are used to a little chaos in their daily lives, and grumble as they might, the fact remains that most still love him. As Obama\u2019s motorcade wound its way from the Vatican to the Quirnale Palace to visit Italy\u2019s president of the republic Giorgio Napolitano, people lined the streets and cheered. \u201cI still like him,\u201d said Gabriele Salari, a Greenpeace press attach\u00e9 who came out to see the president\u2019s motorcade. \u201cHe is courageous and I\u2019m really glad he is here.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s main objective in Rome was to visit Pope Francis, who spent 50 minutes with the president in a closed-door meeting from which little news has escaped.\n\n\u201cIn the context of bilateral relations and cooperation between Church and State, there was a discussion on questions of particular relevance for the Church in that country [the U.S.], such as the exercise of the rights to religious freedom, life and conscientious objection, as well as the issue of immigration reform. Finally, the common commitment to the eradication of trafficking of human persons in the world was stated,\u201d was all the Vatican press office revealed. The president\u2019s press attach\u00e9 had a different take, insisting the men focused on areas of convergence like poverty and inequality.\n\nThe two men seemed serious and somewhat stiff at first, but eventually shared laughs, especially during the gift exchange when the lid of a box of coins the president presented to the pope came ajar, spilling the coins on the floor not once, but twice, causing both men to giggle. The pope presented the president with a copy of his Evangelii Gaudium, an exhortation to the faithful that created a furor among American conservatives when Pope Francis wrote, \u201cAs long as the problems of the poor are not radically resolved by rejecting the absolute autonomy of markets and financial speculation and by attacking the structural causes of inequality, no solution will be found for the world\u2019s problems or, for that matter, to any problems. Inequality is the root of social ills.\u201d Obama, for his part, gave the pope seeds from the White House garden, telling him he should stop by and see it some time. \u201cWhy not?\u201d answered the pope with a smile.\n\nIf the pontiff does come to Washington, perhaps as part of a planned trip to the United States some time in 2015, locals there might get at least a taste of the same logistical nightmare such a visit entails. \u201cHis holiness is probably the only person who has to endure more protocol than I do,\u201d Obama was heard saying during the papal visit. But it seems unlikely that anyone could command as much pomp and circumstance as an American president on a state visit\u2014not even the pope.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:05.629+0000"}

And there are three reasons why they might win.\n\nIt all comes down to this.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission has proposed a plan to reclassify Internet service as a utility, allowing the agency to prohibit cable companies from making \u201cfast lanes\u201d and \u201cslow lanes\u201d of service in violation of a principle known as net neutrality.\n\nThe proposal is a win for supporters of an open Internet, almost all of whom agree that regulation is the best way to prevent what market forces would conspire to destroy\u2014an Internet that hits everyone\u2019s screen as quickly and equally as the water flows out of our faucets.\n\nBut the proposal will make cable companies and their lobbyists angry, which will make them desperate to stop the regulation, which should make you worry.\n\nNet neutrality is not about commerce, economics, or politics. It\u2019s about human rights. The Internet hacked a segmented world with equal access to a powerful medium. That\u2019s led to a surge in expression and entrepreneurship that\u2019s formed the foundation of a more connected society.\n\nThis is a historic fight, and we can\u2019t lose. But here are three reasons why we might.\n\nNet neutrality is incomprehensible. \u201cThe cable companies have figured out the great truth of America,\u201d comedian John Oliver said in a popular Last Week Tonight with John Oliver segment on net neutrality. \u201cIf you want to do something evil, put it inside something boring,\"\n\nThe worst thing about net neutrality is that you can\u2019t explain it in five seconds. Oliver did the movement a favor by allowing his audience to laugh their way to comprehension.\n\nBut it took him 15 minutes to do it.\n\nAt least that June 2013 clip, which has now drawn nearly 7.8 million views on YouTube, made an impact. Public comments opposing an FCC plan to pass all too weak regulation flooded the agency\u2019s website after it aired.\n\n\u201cWho knew NN would be fodder for comedy?\u201d Anne Lucey, senior vice president of regulatory policy at CBS, emailed FCC employees in an email obtained by The Verge.\n\nAn email addressed to conservatives from Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska appealed to an impressive package of fears. Its title? \u201cPutin and Obama in charge of the Internet.\u201d\n\nTalk may be cheap, but communication is everything. A free and open Internet sounds like something that shouldn\u2019t be regulated, so that\u2019s a barrier right there. The analogy of fast lanes and slow lanes seems to be working, as are simple explanatory videos like this New York Times clip that compares variable speeds of Internet service to packages buying their way onto the first delivery truck.\n\nBut even when they\u2019re effective, many explanations are incomplete. Most stories I\u2019ve run into use the example of streaming movies on services like Netflix to illustrate the consequences of giving cable companies their way. It\u2019s a useful example because a) everyone loves entertainment and b) that spinning buffering icon lets you see what being on a slow lane would produce\u2014and feel its frustration.\n\nBut leading with these examples makes it sound like the biggest thing at stake is how quickly you watch a TV show, which is so, so far from the point.\n\n\u201cIf my message comes to you really slowly, and another person\u2019s message comes quickly and directly,\u201d as Times media critic David Carr put it, \u201cwho\u2019s going to be heard?\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re finding better ways to explain net neutrality, but we\u2019re not finding them fast enough. California Congresswoman Anna Eshoo went as far as to lead a contest on Reddit last fall to rebrand net neutrality. The best the community could come up with was \u201cFreedom Against Internet Restrictions.\u201d And I haven\u2019t seen the term since.\n\nNet neutrality is invisible. Net neutrality is not a problem so much as the absence of a problem. It\u2019s a principle that refers only indirectly to the danger it stands against.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to rally support around something that hasn\u2019t happened yet. What\u2019s more, anticipation is not really the Internet\u2019s way.\n\nThe Internet\u2019s way is reaction. When we say that people are angry on Twitter or Facebook or Reddit, it\u2019s usually because something outrageous has already happened, not because it could. You might say the 2012 protests against SOPA (a proposed anti-piracy law that would have allowed law enforcement to block entire domains over one piece of infringing content) were an exception, but barely. It took a lot of people a lot of work to explain what was at stake. And the message barely reached a mainstream audience.\n\nInternet users are pummeled with so many fresh concerns about security and privacy that we\u2019ve become numb to them. We take note, we even grumble, but as all those failed Facebook diasporas demonstrate\u2014we don\u2019t act. Things pop up on us and then we rail against it.\n\nThat won\u2019t work here. If online outrage strikes, the law crawls. Stirrings in Washington make net neutrality an urgent issue . If we don\u2019t wake people up to that now, there will be little use in channeling the inevitable outrage later.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that so few people know what Internet infrastructure even looks like. We see phone lines. We see power lines. But the Internet is underground. It\u2019s in the clouds. It\u2019s easy to miss it, or take it for granted.\n\nWhich brings us to politics.\n\nNet neutrality is up for grabs. When an issue is as vague and airy as net neutrality, it\u2019s easy for someone with a pulpit to define it for his or her own ends. Ted Cruz called net neutrality \u201cObamacare for the Internet\u201d last fall, which was so preposterous that his constituents called him out on it. That was encouraging.\n\nBut appeals to fear go on.\n\nIn November, President Obama urged the FCC to adopt the \u201cstrongest possible rules\u201d to preserve information equality on the Internet. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler appears to have listened.\n\n\"I am submitting to my colleagues the strongest open internet protections ever proposed by the FCC,\" Wheeler wrote in Wednesday morning post in Wired.\n\nWord that Wheeler would take a light touch approach to regulation seem to have borne out: Shares of Comcast and Time Warner spiked Wednesday after Wheeler assured in the post that his proposal would include no \"rate regulation, no tariffs, no last-mile unbundling.\"\n\nRepublicans in Congress have moved away from outright opposition to new rules on cable companies in recent months, and are now proposing legislation that would impose regulations without giving powers to the FCC to carry them out. But the legislation would also bar the FCC from reclassifying broadband Internet access as a utility, and how effective it would be at achieving its ends has been called into question.\n\nAn email addressed to conservatives from Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska appealed to an impressive package of fears\u2014fear of Obama, censorship, surveillance, tyranny, even Russia\u2014to make the argument that giving a federal agency the job of even lightly regulating cable companies would lead to a shutdown of free speech. Its title? \u201cPutin and Obama in charge of the Internet.\u201d\n\nThe weaker the public\u2019s grasp of an issue, the more easily they can be persuaded to act against their own interests. The importance of net neutrality has never been easy to explain, but it\u2019s never been more important to find a definitive way to do it.\n\n\n\nLet the battle begin.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:06.201+0000"}
{"entityId": 1877, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "You don\u2019t have to say you love her, because the election isn\u2019t even directly about her. It\u2019s about finally undoing the Reagan revolution.\n\nIn the last few days, I\u2019ve heard from a couple of relatives who have, or know of friends who have, come down with a case of Hillary Anxiety. Having covered Clinton\u2019s 2000 Senate race closely and spoken at the time with many New York women among whom the malady was first diagnosed, I know the symptoms well.\n\nThey like her, generally speaking, and admire her (I should note that Hillary Anxiety is not limited to women by any means, although it is perhaps more sharply felt by them than by men). They want to see her succeed. They yearn for her to slay the beasts of sexism and gender-role definitions that she has taken it upon herself to battle. Hillary Anxiety, in these respects, is very different from Hillary Distrust or Contempt, which is the more commonly found inflammation among journalists and others inside the Beltway. The Hillary-Anxious are basically on her side.\n\nBut those symptoms: they\u2019re queasy, these folks. The years of charges (valid or not) about corruption, the endless debates about how polarizing she is\u2026it leaves some people feeling exhausted. Before the race has even started, really! Oh, Lord. I like Hillary and want her to be president, but am I really ready to slog through all this\u2026crap again?\n\nThe anxiety is compounded in this case by the natural liberal inclination to want to fall in love, to become besotted. Yes, sure, conservatives want to love their nominees too; but liberals more so. Conservatives have a much more limited agenda; the main changes they really want are lower taxes and to be left alone. But liberals behold a nation and world that is wanting in a thousand ways, and they want their nominee to fix it all! That\u2019s a prodigious faith to place in one person, and a faith that prodigious requires love. Liberals want to fall in love, like they did in 2008.\n\nAll this puts Clinton in a pickle. People aren\u2019t going to love her like they loved Barack Obama. Actually, check that, in part: There are in fact millions of Americans who adore Clinton. I saw them in 2000, too; mothers at upstate county fairgrounds, waiting an hour on the rope line to introduce their daughters to Hillary. You don\u2019t become America\u2019s most admired woman in 17 of the last 20 years without lots of people loving you, but somehow this cohort doesn\u2019t register much on the Washington radar screen.\n\nSo some\u2014many\u2014people do love Clinton, but it\u2019s fair to say that this campaign is just not going to be like Obama\u2019s. Obama was a fresh entity; no real baggage. There was nothing complicated or vexing about getting your heart behind Obama (provided you managed to rationalize away Jeremiah Wright and the verb \u201ccling,\u201d which most liberals did). But basically he was tabula rasa. With Hillary, though, there\u2019s 20-plus years of history here that she, and in our own ways each of us, has to carry into the boxing ring.\n\nSome of the reasons for Hillary Anxiety are real\u2014even though their enemies usually misfire, the Clintons do have a way of handing them round after round of ammunition.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t about love. It\u2019s about a deal between Clinton and liberals. It\u2019s strictly business, and it\u2019s about work. The work of maintaining Democratic control of the White House and keeping the loony right at bay for another four or eight years. The work of trying to move the country forward to a post-supply side economic paradigm. And, yeah, the work of electing our first woman president.\n\nIf you don\u2019t love Hillary, let me offer you two things to love:\n\n1. A liberal majority on the Supreme Court for the next 30, 40 years. You know that the next president may name three or four new justices. Two liberals, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, will likely retire soon. A Republican president would be able to expand the conservative majority to seven, replacing the two aforementioned with two more Alitos or Scalias. Sit with that.\n\nPresident Clinton, on the other hand, will replace them with liberals and may replace Anthony Kennedy or Antonin Scalia, or both, with liberal justices (I\u2019m not wishing illness on anyone here, just being actuarial about things). We haven\u2019t had a liberal Supreme Court majority in this country in 35 years. Such a court would reverse loads of terrible Rehnquist-Roberts era decisions\u2014it would restore voting rights, reverse school re-segregation, revisit the Second Amendment; at the same time it would uphold Roe, defend affirmative action, endorse workplace anti-discrimination policies for LGBT people, and on and on. And those are just the things the Court does that generate the big headlines. Corporate personhood; workers\u2019 rights; campaign finance laws; campaign finance laws (right, I wrote that twice). If you are a liberal and these things aren\u2019t awfully important to you, well, it\u2019s hard to understand exactly what sort of liberal you are.\n\n2. A coming civil war in the Republican Party, and the hope/prayer of a little moderation on its part. When a party loses two consecutive presidential elections, the losses can be chalked up to the appearance of a charismatic candidate and, then, the powers of his incumbency. But three; that\u2019s when people have to start looking hard in the mirror.\n\nCertainly, there will be some in the GOP who\u2019ll trot out the \u201cwe weren\u2019t conservative enough\u201d argument if their side loses. But say Clinton wins with somewhere between Obama\u2019s 2008 total of 365 electoral votes and his 2012 performance of 332; say 347 (Obama\u2019s \u201912 map plus North Carolina). A party that has won 173, 206, and 191 electoral votes, respectively, in the last three elections is a party that\u2019s simply never going to have a prayer of hitting 270 without some major changes.\n\nFor one thing this would be great fun to watch. If the party goes crazy(er), it could split in two. And if it decides to respond with sanity, there\u2019s a great silver lining in that for Democrats and for the country: Tea Party power will wane, non-extreme Republicans won\u2019t fear Club for Growth-financed primary challengers so much, and some of them will actually make compromises and legislate!\n\nI could go on, but you get the idea. What I\u2019m talking about here is not just a handful of policies. I\u2019m talking about the bulk of the Reagan-Gingrich-Bush legacy. Obama could not undo it because he had to deal with the Great Recession. But eight more years of a Democratic presidency can do exactly that\u2014undo it, across a whole range of fronts.\n\nThis and nothing else is the basis of the deal. This election isn\u2019t about Clinton\u2019s personality or vision or lack of it or anything else that\u2019s directly about her. It\u2019s about having the chance to undo what conservatism has wrought for two generations. I can assure you\u2014smart conservatives understand these to be precisely the stakes, if the Democrats win two more straight presidential elections.\n\nThis is not of course to say that people should bottle up all their reservations about Clinton and support her blindly. Some of the reasons for Hillary Anxiety are real\u2014even though their enemies usually misfire, the Clintons do have a way of handing them round after round of ammunition.\n\nAnd we should always have reservations. In fact, that\u2019s one of the key things liberals ought to have learned from 2008: There are no saviors. There is just the hard trench warfare of politics fought within the confines of a system with checks and balances that an obstructionist minority can exploit to great effect. Under this system, victories, like the health care bill, count for a lot; but so too do losses staved off, like handing the top 1 percent still more massive tax relief while adding $2.4 trillion to the deficit, as a President Rubio would do. And they tell us he\u2019s one of the reasonable ones.\n\nTo be a meaningful deal, though, a deal needs two sides, and Clinton has to hold up her end here as well. Simply put, she can\u2019t blow it. The pressure not to blow it is heightened by the fact that she will apparently have no serious intra-party competition. If you\u2019re the franchise player, you\u2019d damn well better get your 30 in the championship game. This is why I wrote last week, apropos the foundation mess, that she and Bill had best clean it up and clean it up fast. I think she deserves liberals\u2019 presumptive support with the minimum of media-induced anxiety. But she better not let us down.\n\nSome early signs are encouraging. It can\u2019t be said enough what an improvement John Podesta is as chief strategist over Mark Penn. Leaps and bounds, ideologically, strategically, ethically, you name it. It reflects well on her judgment that she made this change. And she deserves more credit than she seems to have been getting, in Washington liberal circles anyway, for this criminal justice speech. She called for an end to the era of mass incarceration. When is the last time a first-tier Democratic presidential candidate said that? Heck, her husband, working within the confines of the post-Reagan political landscape, helped to exacerbate that problem. If she is able to follow through on only that, what an incredible undoing of the post-backlash conservative legacy\u2014and change for young black men in this country.\n\nThis is where we are right now in the United States\u2014on the cusp of the end, finally and definitively, of the Age of Reagan. It is attained through seriousness of purpose and focus on the things that matter, on her part and ours. What\u2019s love got to do with it?", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:06.471+0000"}
{"entityId": 1878, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Right after he lost, the Keystone State\u2019s outgoing GOP governor sold his state out to the NRA. But now some mayors are fighting back.\n\nTwo days after losing his reelection bid, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett signed a bill with an amendment that allows the National Rifle Association (NRA) to sue cities and towns that pass ordinances regulating firearms by claiming they infringe upon individual rights. Until the gun lobby\u2019s dream amendment got tacked on in the final hours of the legislative session, Act 192 had nothing to do with guns; it criminalizes the theft of secondary metal, like copper wire, and it had broad support.\n\nWith Democrat Tom Wolf replacing the Republican Corbett, the NRA and its allies in the legislature had to act quickly. In his haste, Corbett even signed the wrong version of the bill, and had to be called back for a second signing. Outraged at how gun enthusiasts rammed through the amendment, Democratic State Senator Daylin Leach recruited several other elected officials plus the cities of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Lancaster to challenge the law\u2019s constitutionality.\n\nPennsylvania law says amendments must be germane, and empowering the NRA to sue municipalities for enacting gun laws is far afield from Act 192\u2019s intent. Leach, a lawyer, wrote the brief himself, and the lawsuit is before the Commonwealth Court. \u201cThe Pennsylvania legislature is essentially a wholly owned subsidiary of the NRA,\u201d he says, explaining that the NRA saw an opening in the closing days of Corbett\u2019s term to \u201csneak it in\u201d while it had the votes and a proven ally in the governor\u2019s office.\n\nThe NRA quickly used its newfound legal power, suing a number of municipalities and threatening others to get them to back down. The amendment as written says an organization does not need what\u2019s known as \u201cstanding\u201d\u2014in other words, the NRA doesn\u2019t have to prove someone has been harmed by a gun safety law. It can just outright sue, and if it wins, the city or town has to pay the group\u2019s legal expenses. But there\u2019s no risk to the NRA; if it loses, it doesn\u2019t pay the winning side\u2019s legal expenses.\n\nWhen Leach asked, \u201c\u2019Are you still with me?\u2019 most didn\u2019t respond; one said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to fuck you, buddy.\u2019\u201d\n\nEd Foley, the mayor of Jenkintown, a borough in the Philadelphia suburbs, told the Daily Beast that the NRA forced him \u201cto choose between public safety and financial solvency.\u201d Foley describes Jenkintown on his Twitter account as \u201c0.6 square miles of the best place to live, dine, shop, and raise a family.\u201d With a population of 4,500 and a budget of $6.5 million, \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to defend a law suit even if we win it, and if we lose, we have to pay their legal fees. That\u2019s a form of blackmail,\u201d he says, \u201cor maybe extortion is a better word.\u201d\n\nUnder the threat of a lawsuit brought by the NRA, an ordinance in place since 2010 requiring Jenkintown residents to report lost or stolen firearms at the police station was rescinded in a public meeting. \u201cIt was a hold-your-nose vote,\u201d says Foley. \u201cIt\u2019s such an innocuous law, and it doesn\u2019t do anything to restrict anybody\u2019s right to have a gun. I don\u2019t know why the NRA isn\u2019t a bigger supporter of the police. The police want the law.\u201d\n\nThe NRA never plays defense, it always goes on offense, says Jim Kessler, a co-founder of Third Way, a moderate Democratic group. \u201cEven after Sandy Hook, they were trying to expand their reach and loosen gun laws,\u201d he says. The nation may have recoiled in horror at the massacre of 20 first graders, but the NRA\u2019s response is always more access to guns, not more restrictions. A movement to expand gun rights is growing, fueled by a libertarian streak on the right and the left, and it is playing out on the state level. In Florida, a campus shooting in November prompted a House panel to approve guns on college campuses, a first step to overturning a state ban on concealed weapons on university grounds.\n\nGun safety advocates favor ballot measures like the one Washington state passed in 2014 requiring background checks while gun rights groups work their will through state legislatures. State Senator Leach tells the story of the time when he had the votes to overturn the \u201cFlorida loophole\u201d in Pennsylvania law. Then the NRA lobbied each member one by one \u201cand they came back ashen-faced.\u201d When Leach asked, \u201c\u2019Are you still with me?\u2019 most didn\u2019t respond; one said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to fuck you, buddy.\u2019\u201d The Florida loophole allows people who can\u2019t get a gun under Pennsylvania\u2019s very low standards to go online, get one from Florida, and Pennsylvania will respect that. \u201cWe would never do that on marriage,\u201d says Leach. \u201c Let another state decide what to do in our state.\u201d As for his colleague\u2019s X-rated comment, he says, \u201cI appreciated his candor, and that\u2019s the Democratic caucus. I\u2019m sure the Republican caucus is far worse.\u201d\n\n\n\nNot everyone is afraid of the NRA. Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto declared in a statement that the city would not be deterred from enforcing its requirement that lost and stolen firearms must be reported: \u201cToo many people are being killed in the streets of Pittsburgh and other cities with stolen guns. It\u2019s a common-sense requirement, which is why police across the state support the regulation, as do many members of the NRA.\u201d\n\nMayor Richard Gray of Lancaster, a city of some 60,000 known for its distinctive Amish population, is also determined to protect its requirement that lost or stolen firearms are reported to the police within 72 hours. \u201cThe NRA is trying to bully smaller communities,\u201d Gray told the Beast. \u201cI learned in junior high school the one way to deal with a bully is to stand up to him, so we\u2019re not backing down. And if they lose, over a hundred communities will pass the same law. I guarantee it.\u201d\n\nA Common Sense Lancaster Legal Defense Fund was launched in mid-January, and has collected almost $10,000 in small contributions. Gray says the NRA is \u201ca paper tiger,\u201d and if challenged can be defeated. He said in a statement announcing the Fund that statewide legislation to make reporting of lost or stolen guns mandatory was introduced in the Pennsylvania legislature in 2007, but it never got out of committee. He noted that the new law granting unprecedented legal power to the NRA was needed, according to its prime sponsor, \u201cto stop little tyrants at the local level from enacting their own gun-control measures.\u201d Now it\u2019s up to the voters and the courts to judge where the tyranny lies, whose rights are being trampled, and whether Act 192 will be allowed to endure as the will of the people, or the product of a process bullied by the NRA.\n\nA previous version of this piece mistakenly attributed state Sen.

{"entityId": 1879, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "No one\u2019s usually cared much who held secretary of state posts at the state level. Then the parties noticed that they have one major duty.\n\nWith control of the Senate up for grabs and a Republican House looking to expand its majority in November, it would seem strange for DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to spend even a minute thinking about usually sleepy down-ballot races like the open seat for Iowa\u2019s Secretary of State.\n\nBut at the Democratic National Committee summer meeting last month, Wasserman Schultz not only talked about that Iowa contest\u2014she also promised to campaign for the Democrat in the race, Brad Anderson, and four other Democratic secretary of state candidates in swing states across the country this fall. Why use so much fire power on such low-profile offices?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to ensuring that those who administer elections do so fairly,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said, singling out five races in Ohio, New Mexico, Colorado, and Nevada, in addition to Iowa, as the ones she\u2019s most focused on. \u201cThe fights over voter ID and early voting are just the latest reminder of how important the rules for elections are in shaping the electorate and determining the eventual outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe office of secretary of state was once little more than a pit stop on the road to higher office\u2014four years of resume building that included inglorious duties like licensing beauticians and other small businesses, maintaining state historical records, and running around the state handing out proclamations to civic groups. But more than three dozen secretaries of state across the country have one duty that\u2019s as serious as they come: They oversee and administer elections.\n\nOver the last several years, secretary of state offices have taken on a new and more controversial role as partisan legislatures pushed changes to election laws and secretaries of state were charged with making decisions on everything from ballot language to voter eligibility to voting hours and crucial calls in contested elections. The decisions ultimately affect not only who votes in elections, but often who wins them.\n\nLook no further for the evidence than Kansas, where the Republican Secretary of State Kris Kobach ruled on Thursday that the Democrat in the Senate race cannot take his name off the ballot, a decision that will likely benefit incumbent GOP Sen. Pat Roberts, whose campaign Kobach is supporting.\n\n\n\nAs the jobs have gained prominence and power, so has the pressure for the two parties to win them. Republicans currently dominate the breakdown, with 27 GOP secretaries of state in the 47 states that have the position. Democrats believe reversing that ratio is key to expanding ballot access in the short term among traditionally friendly constituencies like low-income seniors, women, and minorities, as well as setting the table for the 2016 presidential elections by having Democratic elections officials in place in key swing states.\n\nThe mastermind behind the unprecedented attention to the races is Pratt Wiley, a veteran of the Obama campaign who joined the DNC in an expanded capacity last year as Director of Voter Expansion.\n\n\"As we started to talk about the voter expansion program and ways we could expand access to the ballot box, this was a big piece of the platform,\u201d Wiley said of the five races. \"For a lot of us at the DNC, 2012 was a real eye-opener, the degree to which the Republican legislatures, Republican governors, and Republican secretaries of state will use their official powers in office in order to make it more difficult for folks to vote.\u201d\n\nPratt pointed to new voting laws in North Carolina, Ohio, Iowa, and Texas, as well as voter list purges in Florida, as examples of Republicans making it difficult, and sometimes impossible, for legally eligible voters to cast their ballots. \u201cOne of the best ways to deal with that is to change the leadership at the top,\u201d Wiley said.\n\nNot surprisingly, Republicans take issue with Democrats\u2019 portrait of GOP-sponsored voting reforms as a cover for voter suppression.\n\n\u201cRepublicans want to make it easier to vote but harder to cheat,\u201d said Jill Bader, spokeswoman for the Republican State Leadership Committee, a Republican-led 527 group that spent more than $30 million in 2012 on down-ballot races like secretary of state positions. \u201cWe want everybody to come and vote, but we want to make sure we have secure elections.\u201d Bader pointed to Republicans' new registration site as evidence of the party's commitment to expanding the vote and said the DNC is just catching up to where Republicans have been for years\u2014focusing on state-level contests: \u201cI am not at all surprised to see Debbie Wasserman Schultz looking at what we\u2019ve known for a long time, which is that real results come in the states.\u201d\n\n\"For a lot of us at the DNC, 2012 was a real eye-opener, the degree to which the Republican legislatures, Republican governors, and Republican secretaries of state will use their official powers in office in order to make it more difficult for folks to vote.\u201d\n\n\n\nBader would not say which races the RSLC will spend resources on, but she said defending current GOP-held seats like the one in Ohio is a top priority. That\u2019s where Democratic state senator Nina Turner is challenging GOP Secretary of State Jon Husted, who made national headlines earlier this year when he announced he\u2019d cut back state-wide early voting hours to eliminate in evenings and the Sunday before Election Day.\n\nBoth parties are also focused on the open seat in Iowa, where the outgoing Republican incumbent was roundly criticized for spending nearly $300,000 earlier this year prosecuting a case of voter fraud against a woman who voted in an uncontested mayoral race in which 110 ballots were cast. The woman was acquitted of perjury, which could have landed the mother of three 15 years in jail.\n\nThe importance of the individual secretary of state races has become so significant that two Super PACs launched with great fanfare at the beginning of the year promising to spend millions to win them. But FEC filings show that neither the left-leaning SoS for Democracy nor the right-leaning SoS for SoS have taken off yet. So far, SoS for Democracy lists just one donation, $250,000 from George Soros, while SoS for SoS shows a little more than $3,000 in donations in 2014 and $300 cash on hand as of July.\n\nThat leaves the DNC and RSLC as the big players on the field, where the real, if usually unspoken, prize is having a team of their own to call on during the 2016 presidential elections, if the need arises.\n\n\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any confusion that just as in 2000 when Katherine Harris became a household name across the country, these offices matter,\u201d said the DNC\u2019s Wiley. \u201cHaving the wrong person at the wrong place at the wrong time could affect a presidency. Our job is to make sure that doesn't happen.\"", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:06.968+0000"}

{"entityId": 1881, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Now that Republicans are opportunistically talking about stagnant wages, Democrats finally have the chance to throw supply-side economics in the dustbin of history.\n\nIt\u2019s now shaping up that wages and the condition of the middle class are going to be the dominant issues as we enter this first phase of the 2016 slog. Don\u2019t take it from me, or even from Elizabeth Warren. Speaker John Boehner said as much (well, almost) on the day he opened the new session of Congress.\n\nThis is a very big deal, and it\u2019s about more than our usual, tug-of-war politics. Boehner\u2019s mention of wage stagnation was clearly opportunistic, because it\u2019s a current problem that can be hung around the President\u2019s neck. But middle-class wage stagnation is much more than an Obama problem. It\u2019s our main economic reality for 30-plus years now.\n\nThe first chart in this article tells the basic story. Since 1979, American workers\u2019 productivity has increased by 80 percent. The income of the top 1 percent has increased 240 percent. And the average American wage, adjusted for inflation, has gone up just a few percentage points, maybe 8 percent. It wasn\u2019t always this way, and it isn\u2019t nearly this bad in other advanced countries. The median wage in the United States today is around $50,000. If wages had kept pace with productivity gains, the median wage would be more than $90,000.\n\nBut look: It\u2019s highly serendipitous that the wage problem is something the Republicans can use against Obama (at least for now). That means they\u2019ll talk about it. What they\u2019ll come up with in terms of solutions beyond tax cuts and deregulation is another matter, but the mere fact that they\u2019ll talk about it means that both parties will be talking about it, and when both parties are talking about an issue, that issue tends to rise to the top of the charts.\n\nOn paper at least, this is great for Democrats, because wage stagnation is basically a Democratic issue, one that most voters would probably trust the Democrats to do a better job on than Republicans. Although of course, if it comes to be October 2016 and wages are still as flat as they\u2019ve been since the crash, that could be a problem for the Democrats. So what they need to do is frame wages not as a post-crash, Obama-era problem, but instead to make sure Americans know that this is a deep historical problem, and that the moment to address is right now.\n\nThe point is to influence the direction of the debate, especially the presidential campaign debate.\n\nTo that end, you should know that this past week was a really good one for progressive economics in Washington (and none of it had anything to do with Warren!). Two major proposals were floated to address these problems. They\u2019re real and meaty. And if events go in the direction I hope they do, their release in mid-January 2015 will be remembered as the moment when the debate turned.\n\nFirst, on Monday, Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland put out a report by the Democratic staff of the House Budget Committee called \u201cAn Action Plan to Grow the Paychecks of All, Not Just the Wealthy Few.\u201d All right, a bit cumbersome as a title. But give it credit anyway for getting to the point.\n\n\u201cI sat down with our team many months ago,\u201d Van Hollen told me Thursday, \u201cand we began to really tackle what would need to be done to deal with wage stagnation.\u201d The plan is built around nine ideas. The one that\u2019s gotten the most attention because of the obvious \u201cclass warfare\u201d angle is the so-called Wall Street tax, a fee of .1 percent on financial market transactions.\n\nBut there are much more interesting ideas in the paper. The most notable may be a limit on the amount of deductions corporations can take for executive pay if those executives are keeping wages stagnant or laying off workers. \u201cFrom 2007 to 2010,\u201d Van Hollen says, \u201ccorporations took $66 billion in deductions on executive pay. That\u2019s a huge amount of money. We say here that if you want to take a tax deduction, you\u2019d better be giving your employees a raise.\u201d\n\nVan Hollen unveiled his proposals at the Center for American Progress on Monday. Then, two days later, CAP president Neera Tanden led a press conference unveiling a major new report on inclusive prosperity, under a panel co-chaired by Larry Summers and Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor of the exchequer for the British Labour Party. The CAP plan, which Tanden stressed is international in the scopes of its analyses and proposed fixes (hence Balls\u2019s inclusion), is aimed at the same basic problem Van Hollen is shooting at\u2014the need to raise the incomes of the middle class.\n\nSummers, speaking at the press conference, emphasized an issue he\u2019s been talking up for a long time, a \u201cvery substantial\u201d increase in infrastructure investment. \u201cWhen we can borrow at 1.8 percent in our own currency, and when construction unemployment approaches double digits,\u201d as it is now, Summers said, \u201cthat\u2019s the moment when Kennedy Airport should be fixed.\u201d\n\nNo one is under the illusion that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell are going to rush out and pass these measures. That isn\u2019t the point. The point is to influence the direction of the debate, especially the presidential campaign debate. And that, of course, raises the question of the extent to which a certain former senator and secretary of state will embrace these ideas. Tanden was a longtime Hillary Clinton staffer. The imprimatur of Summers on these progressive ideas should raise Clinton\u2019s comfort level with them. If Clinton runs on half of these ideas, and she\u2019s signaling that she might, she\u2019ll be a more progressive candidate than she was in 2008.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that we\u2019ve lived with this kind of wage picture, this kind of raging unfairness, for nearly 40 years. Of course, part of the reason that we have lived with it for 40 years is that the Democratic Party wasn\u2019t always much good at articulating a theory of economic growth that could counter the Republicans\u2019 trickle-down argument. They\u2019re finally finding their voice on this. And so, the real importance of the next election is not the Supreme Court, not climate change, not foreign policy, crucial as all those things are. It\u2019s that it could write the obituary of supply-side economics.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:07.679+0000"}

Louie Gohmert of Texas became the second Republican to declare he would challenge Boehner for the speaker\u2019s gavel.\n\nGohmert, a bombastic right-winger prone to making controversial comments, joins Ted Yoho, a former large-animal veterinarian from Florida, as a potential conservative alternative to Boehner.\n\nNow, neither Gohmert nor Yoho will be the next speaker.

By tradition, the speaker of the House never participates in debates in the House and remains silent. Considering Gohmert spoke for 29 hours on the House floor on the Congress in 2014, 19 hours more than any other member, wielding the speaker\u2019s gavel would likely cramp his style.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:08.634+0000"}

Last month, Rand Paul spoke at the church, and Brooks has invited all active presidential candidate to make the trip down to 6620 South Martin Luther King Drive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really pushing hard to get Jeb [Bush] down here,\u201d Brooks told me after Carson\u2019s speech.\n\nThe latest Bush to run for president would certainly be a big get, but considering it isn\u2019t every day that Republicans run around in President Obama\u2019s territory, any presidential candidate showing their face on South King should be a spectacle. Even so, Carson\u2019s visit prompted a minuscule media response. One of the only video cameras present for his remarks was operated by a public access TV station, and Carson\u2019s entire entourage was small enough to fit into an SUV.\n\n\u201cWhy do people burn their own neighborhoods down? Because there\u2019s no economic development going on.\u201d\n\nA darling among conservative media, Carson isn\u2019t a household name for the average member of Brooks\u2019s congregation. Not that it matters to some in the black community, including one man who asked Carson about media coverage in Baltimore and Ferguson after the deaths of Freddie Gray and Mike Brown.\n\n\u201cCarnage and discord, that\u2019s what sells,\u201d Carson said.\n\nIn his remarks to the crowd, peppered with plenty of references to his Christian beliefs, Carson addressed the protests, riots, uprising, movement, or whatever you want to call it that has taken hold as national attention has shifted to the matter of black men being killed by police officers.\n\n\u201cWhy do people burn their own neighborhoods down? Because there\u2019s no economic development going on,\u201d Carson said, before adding what three years ago would have been a stinging soundbite against Obama. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of change, but there\u2019s not a lot of hope.\u201d\n\nCarson went on to describe a six-month, tax-free holiday that would allow corporations to bring money earned overseas back to U.S. banks without consequences from the IRS. The policy statement, one of the few specifics offered by any of the dozen-plus people running for the most powerful position in the world, was met with a murmur. But an addendum to the holiday did garner quite a bit of applause: Ten percent of the returning overseas corporate cash\u2014which Carson has pegged at $2 trillion\u2014would have to be used for \u201cthe creation of jobs for people on welfare and who are unemployed.\u201d\n\nFor all his talk of bootstraps, Carson joined scores of Republicans and Democrats before him in promising money\u2014this time from corporations and not the government\u2014in helping to improve the dire economic circumstances in the black community. A 25-year veteran of the Chicago Police Department in the audience on Sunday agreed with Carson\u2019s assessment that the rage on display in Baltimore, Ferguson, and elsewhere has its roots in poverty. The cop, a black patrolman who works in the city\u2019s toughest neighborhoods, noted Carson\u2019s political covenant, as well.\n\n\u201cPoliticians know what the public wants to hear, and they come out here and tell you exactly that,\u201d said the cop, who didn\u2019t want to give his name because, well, \u201cthis is Chicago,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis right here,\u201d he said dismissively of Carson\u2019s visit, \u201cthis was nothing.\u201d\n\nNothing new. Except a new face. And some new politics. While Brooks is more than happy to introduce his congregation, and Woodlawn, and the South and West sides of Chicago, to Paul, Carson, and whoever else accepts the pastor\u2019s invitation, Brooks knows he is also challenged with opening people up to something that for decades has been taboo in the black community: supporting Republicans.\n\nMichael Jones, who made it for the tail end of Carson\u2019s remarks and stayed for a plate of food provided by workers and volunteers at Brooks\u2019s church, showed just how difficult that challenge may be.\n\n\u201cI vote Democrat,\u201d he said when asked if he would ever consider voting for a Republican.\n\n\u201cHillary?\u201d\n\n\u201cHillary, whoever. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cI live in a Democrat community. I vote Democrat.\u201d\n\nBy the time Jones made that comment, Ben Carson was long gone, his hood pass likely exchanged for a plane ticket.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:09.182+0000"}

The gorgeous women. The comfortable shoes. The hate mail and harassment. I just can\u2019t get enough.\n\nSo I completely understand how the Republican Governor of Texas Rick Perry could compare being gay to being an alcoholic. Duh! Nothing offensive about that at all. Gayness passes across my lips and courses through my veins like a 20-year-old scotch.\n\nAnd much like alcoholism, being gay makes me do reckless and dangerous things. Like have a kid. And want to get married. And fight for equal treatment and justice for all. Things we can\u2019t have everyone rushing to do because, dammit, love and equality are downright un-American.\n\nRecently, the Texas Republican Convention approved language in its official party platform that reads: \u201cHomosexuality must not be presented as an acceptable alternative lifestyle, in public policy, nor should family be redefined to include homosexual couples. We believe there should be no granting of special legal entitlements or creation of special status for homosexual behavior, regardless of state of origin.\u201d\n\nThe platform goes on to endorse so-called \u201creparative therapy\u201d to \u201ccure\u201d being gay and says that no laws shall be endorsed to limit such options.\n\nMind you, Perry is the leader of a state where 58 percent of voters support marriage equality \u2014where public opinion has dramatically shifted from just 10 years ago.\n\nNever mind for a second that every single major psychological association has dismissed \u201creparative therapy\u201d as not only offensive and ineffective but damaging\u2014the founder of the \u201cgay cure\u201d treatment even repudiated it! But Texas apparently prides itself on being woefully behind the times.\n\nWhen asked about his state party\u2019s platform language, Perry said he didn\u2019t know whether the therapy worked or not \u2026 and then added: \u201cWhether or not you feel compelled to follow a particular lifestyle or not, you have the ability to decide not to do that.\u201d For example: \u201cI may have the genetic coding that I'm inclined to be an alcoholic, but I have the desire not to do that, and I look at the homosexual issue the same way.\u201d\n\nMind you, this is the leader of a state where 58 percent of voters support marriage equality\u2014where public opinion has dramatically shifted from just 10 years ago when most Texans opposed same-sex marriage. Perry is helpfully illustrating the increasingly profound disconnect between Republican political leaders and mainstream American voters that is hobbling the Republican Party nationwide. On issues from immigration reform to common-sense gun safety to Social Security and Medicare, Republican political figures continue to adopt positions that may please the vocal fringe in their base but alienate the vast majority of mainstream Americans.\n\nAlso this week a Republican candidate for the state House of Representatives in Oklahoma endorsed stoning gay people to death. Ancient views literally wrapped in a ancient response reflective of an increasingly ancient political party.\n\nOn some level I get it\u2014stoking the culture war has served Republicans well for the last generation, and they can\u2019t quite let go of the fact that hard-line conservative social views now turn off more voters than they entice. Plus with their economic policies that only benefit the rich, and with Democrats increasingly dominating public opinion on national security, it\u2019s not like Republicans have any other drums to beat. So that sound you hear is Republicans desperately beating the drum of the divisive culture war as their moral crusade and political relevance fade into the distance.\n\nAs an American, I\u2019m downright depressed that a major political party in our country is fanning the flames of hatred and inequality in order to eke votes out of its increasingly marginal base of support. But as a Democrat, of course I\u2019m giddy\u2014these extremist and ugly views have no place in our modern society and a party that espouses them should rightfully become equally obsolete. That giddiness is a warm and fuzzy feeling, almost as good as being drunk but definitely not as good as being gay.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:09.654+0000"}

The Sunshine State has come a long way in the two decades since Jeb Bush declared that he didn\u2019t want \u201csodomy\u201d to have \u201cthe same constitutional status as race and religion.\u201d\n\n\n\nLike many Americans\u2014but few Republican presidential candidates\u2014the former Florida governor has evolved on the issue. Confronted with the reality of legalization, Bush expressed \u201crespect for the good people on all sides of the gay and lesbian marriage issue.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe one-time conservative culture warrior has become more of a conciliator, and a new treasure trove of emails from his time in Tallahassee show then-Gov. Bush busy engaging constituents on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate ahead of the 2004 presidential election.\n\n\n\nTo those who agreed with him, Bush pledged that the law against same-sex marriage would remain intact. To his critics, he explained\u2014sometimes at painful length\u2014his reasoning against it.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps most important, these emails provide a bridge from the potential presidential contender\u2019s past to his present and future.\n\n\n\nThink back to the Bush-Kerry race of 2004, the Thrilla in Vanilla. Gay marriage was the hot-button fight on the left and right.\n\n\n\nWhile the White House urged support for a constitutional amendment to prohibit gay marriage and several states had their own bans on the ballot, Massachusetts edged closer to legalizing gay marriage, and same-sex marriage licenses were issued in San Francisco that February.\n\nMeanwhile, in Florida, Bush was flooded with questions about whether gay marriage could possibly come to the Sunshine State. His answer: Not on my watch.\n\n\u201cI do not support gay marriages being recognized in Florida,\u201d he wrote Andrew Walther of Sanford. \u201cThat is the law and it will stay that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe institution of marraige [sic] is under attack in our society and it needs to be strengthened.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, please do not permit this to happen here in Florida,\u201d wrote Cris K. Smith of East Polk County. \u201cWe here in Florida do not want to be in the same boat as California. I believe that this is going to spread like wild fire. Let\u2019s put out the fire before it has a chance to start.\u201d A few days later, Bush replied, \u201cWe will uphold the law in Florida.\u201d\n\nBut the governor\u2019s response to a man who disagreed with him on the issue perhaps revealed the most about where his position was going in the future.\n\nThat man was Xavier Cortada, a gay man who wrote of his frustration that he and his partner of eight years were unable to marry. Cortada wrote that he felt \u201cparticularly denied and particularly unequal\u201d by the move to pass a constitutional amendment against gay marriage on the federal level. \u201cI feel suffocated\u2014living in a society where liberty evaporates with every attack on people who happen to be gay\u2014and I see it can only get worse as this debate rages on,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBush responded about a month later. \u201cThank you for writing and I apologize for not responding earlier. The tyranny of the present has gotten me!\u201d Bush wrote. \u201cI am sensitive to your point of view but respectfully disagree. If there is discrimination, there are remedies. The cases of violence against gay and lesbians are unconscionable and the laws in Florida exist to bring justice.\u201d\n\nBush then suggested that Cortada and his partner could be \u201cmade more permanent through contractual obligations that set forth asset disposition and other issues\u201d but added that he did not believe their relationship \u201cshould be afforded the same status in the law as a man and a woman agreeing to marraige [sic].\u201d\n\n\u201cThe institution of marraige [sic] is under attack in our society and it needs to be strengthened,\u201d Bush wrote. \u201cThis does not have to be at the expense of other kinds of relationships but in support of the most important institution in our society.\u201d\n\nBut the tide was turning on this issue, an email from another constituent made clear. \u201cI am a heterosexual conservative Republican that has voted for you and President Bush twice and now more than ever disappointed in both of you for your stand on the gay issue,\u201d wrote Randy A. Sullivan. \u201cYour stands appear to me as hatred for someone who is different from you and therefore you are willing to discriminate against them.\u201d\n\nBush replied his position was \u201cnot based on hate or is it discriminatory\u2026 I have said that traditional marriage between a man and a woman should be protected in the Constitution if the courts rule that gays can marry.\u201d\n\nLater in the year, Bush stopped short of backing his brother\u2019s call for a constitutional amendment when asked what he was \u201chearing as it relates to a constitutional amendment on the defense of marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the amendment is necessary since gay marriages aren\u2019t legal in our state,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cMy view would change if someone could prove to me that that our law is vulnerable to future court challenges. I don\u2019t see it.\u201d In a bit of foreshadowing, he repeated that opinion in November. \u201cOur state already prohibits gay marriage,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUnless there is a court decision that changes our law, we are OK.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear whether the field of conservative candidates\u2014and the Republican primary electorate\u2014will force Bush back to somewhere closer to his 1994 self if he chooses to run for president.\n\nBut his answer to The Miami Herald, after the court struck down the Florida ban, seemed to point to a continued, albeit reluctant, evolution on the issue.\n\n\u201cThe state decided.

{"entityId": 1887, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "There is a fascinating Saturday Night Live sketch from 1980, a piece almost entirely forgotten by most viewers of the NBC comedy show. The sketch survives in the pop culture arena only because it features the SNL debut of comedian Eddie Murphy. Airing about a month after the country elected an ex-actor to the presidency (ousting a former Georgia peanut farmer in the process), the skit is a spoof of Mutual of Omaha\u2019s Wild Kingdom, that unconventional animal wildlife series sponsored by an insurance company. In the SNL piece, a Jim Fowler\u2013type zoologist braves the \u201csavage\u201d landscape of a tony Manhattan cocktail party in search of an elusive subject: the Negro Republican. Tracking the \u201cmigratory patterns\u201d of African Americans \u201cfleeing the liberal lake wastelands\u201d for the \u201cfertile promised land of the GOP,\u201d the scientist stumbles badly\u2014a hilarious case of mistaken identity\u2014when he assumes that a black funeral parlor director must be a member of the GOP. Undeterred, he spots another black man nearby\u2014a thorough examination of speech patterns, clothing, musi- cal tastes, and economic interests confirms that the subject is indeed the evasive Negro Republican. With great care, the zoologist sedates the \u201cex- otic creature,\u201d attaching a blinking transmitter disguised as an American flag pin to the man\u2019s lapel. As the disoriented man awakens, the scientist quickly hides, emerging to take notes on his subject from afar once the Negro Republican has wandered back into the \u201cwild.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Search of the Negro Republican\u201d is a riveting political satire, interesting not for the writing or the cast\u2019s performance but for the ideas conveyed by the sketch\u2014ideas about popular perceptions of African American members of the GOP. A black Republican, it would seem, was a rare fellow in 1980\u2014a political opportunist and an economic conservative who, seduced by the promise of a Reagan Revolution, had disavowed his longtime home in the Democratic Party. By that same token, a black Re- publican was a racial turncoat\u2014a Benedict Arnold in blackface who had appropriated clich\u00e9d notions of middle-class whiteness: a stuffy voice, a preference for the Carpenters over the Isley Brothers, the choice of a drab, unsophisticated suit, and a degree of comfort with the quintessential symbol of American patriotism, Old Glory. A black Republican was a curiosity\u2014a creature to be observed, sedated, and studied.\n\nThe SNL sketch, as with any satire, is a primer in exaggeration, entertaining precisely because it taps into stereotypes of black Republicans\u2014caricatures that we know logically are absurd, yet nevertheless still make some kind of intuitive sense. The uneasy racialized undertones of the sketch are rendered practically invisible because something about the parody resonates. Stripped of nuance, the stereotype works because it exposes the fundamental question that so many of us ask: Why would an African American join the Republican Party? The question is an old one, an ubiquitous inquiry that many people, Democrats and Republicans alike, have posed consistently since the 1930s\u2014the decade when black voters first began to flee the Republican Party, then known as the \u201cParty of Lincoln,\u201d an ideological home so very different from what \u201cRepublican\u201d means today. Since then, the link between blacks and Democrats has become a knee-jerk one, a relationship that is taken for granted by all sides. Over the decades, the concept of a \u201cblack Republican\u201d has come to seem a contradiction in terms, invested with an odd kind of alienness. \u201cSince President Franklin and the New Deal,\u201d wrote the editors at the Chicago De- fender in 1976, \u201cbeing black and Republican was about as compatible as being black and aspiring to leadership in the Ku Klux Klan.\u201d\n\nBeneath the stereotypes and the made-for-TV satire, our notions of black Republicans rest on two basic truths. First, without question, blacks are the most partisan of any racial group in the United States. Since 1948, a substantial majority of African Americans has identified as Democrat; since 1964, that lopsided figure has only increased, as more than 80 percent of black voters have cast their ballots for the Democratic Party nominee in every presidential election. By 1980, more than 90 per- cent of the nation\u2019s five thousand black elected officials were Democrats, including all of the members of the Congressional Black Caucus. And in 2012, African Americans played a vital role in helping reelect Barack Obama to the White House, offering the president 94 percent of their votes. This partisanship, as Michael Dawson, Nancy Weiss, and others have suggested, \u201cwas never blind or random but was based on a realistic assessment of which party would best further black political and economic interests.\u201d And as the extensive histories of civil rights and black politics make clear, African Americans made critical and significant advances for racial equality and social justice by way of the New Deal and the Great Society programs, thereby \u201canchoring\u201d African Americans in Democratic liberalism.\n\nOur implicit views of black Republicans\u2014either as strange alien creatures or as noble exceptions among their duped Democratic brethren\u2014reject the notion of political choice; too often we assume that blacks in America are Democrats by default; though not intentional, that assumption denies agency to an entire group of citizens.\n\nSecond, the GOP of today bears little resemblance to the \u201cParty of Lincoln\u201d to which black voters had been fiercely loyal since the era of Reconstruction. Instead, the modern Republican Party is indelibly associated with Herbert Hoover\u2019s \u201clily-white\u201d movement, \u201cOperation Dixie\u201d of the 1950s, and Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201csouthern strategy.\u201d It is a party whose 1964 presidential candidate voted against the landmark Civil Rights Act passed in that year, and whose 1980 nominee launched his official presidential campaign with a now-infamous \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d speech in Philadelphia, Mississippi\u2014the town in which three civil rights workers were murdered sixteen years earlier. As politicians shaped the GOP from the \u201ctop down,\u201d ordinary white city dwellers and suburbanites from all backgrounds and income levels along with an \u201carmy\u201d of conservative activists, influenced the direction of the GOP from the grass roots, reacting to changing social and cultural norms, the liberalism of the civil rights movement and the radicalism of Black Power. In short, the GOP is a party whose conservatism, to quote Robert Smith and Hanes Walton, seems to make it \u201cvirtually impossible for blacks, given their history and condition,\u201d to accept.\n\nThese two strands of thought are mutually reinforcing, confirmed through our everyday experiences: individual encounters, media reports, fictional depictions in television and film, and scholarly studies all work in concert to produce a pervasive vision of the past century that leaves little room for the coexistence of African Americans, conservatism, and the Republican Party. All of our instincts, scholarly and otherwise, tell us that African Americans should not be Republicans, nor should they be conservatives. Yet black Republicans do exist\u2014and their inevitable existence, of course, complicates our assumptions. Some black families never left the Republican fold, while other individuals have found their way back to the GOP. The past three decades alone have witnessed the rise of a number of prominent African American members of the Republican Party: Samuel Pierce, Clarence Thomas, Colin Powell, J. C. Watts, Condoleezza Rice, Michael Steele, Constance Berry Newman, Alan Keyes, Robert A. George, Herman Cain, Michael Powell, Lynn Swann, Allen West, and Tim Scott, to name a few. But rather than erasing public curiosity, the appearance of black Republicans merely intensifies it, often infusing a new urgency into the original underlying question of why.\n\nThat curiosity is often suffused with a measure of frustration: the question of why quickly becomes a more loaded inquiry: How could they? For some, anger with black Republicans is an implicit rejection of a larger accommodationist tradition. To their critics, black Republicans are Booker T. Washington\u2019s successors, racial apologists whose affiliations and beliefs mark them as traitorous individuals, complicit in an age-old crusade to \u201cdelegitimize the black quest for racial and social justice.\u201d A black Republican, the Pittsburgh Courier spat in 1992, \u201cis a kind of bogeyman dressed in a Black tailored suit or immaculate silk dress, to cajole Blacks into believing the Republican Party and its brand of conservatism is a trumpet-tongued angel playing the jazz of economic salvation and racial harmony.\u201d Such music, the black newspaper criticized, \u201cis nothing more than bubbles of gas emanating from the butt of reptiles.\u201d However, as we shall see, the \u201csongs\u201d of black Republicans are far more complicated and multivocal.\n\nIn contrast, white Republicans often heap gratuitous public praise on African American members of the GOP, applauding them for having the gumption to leave the \u201cplantation politics of the Democratic Party,\u201d as Pat Buchanan did on CNN in 2011, while defending Herman Cain. This line of thinking stems from the flawed and simplistic belief that African Americans have been brainwashed into voting for the Democratic Party and, as a result, ignore the benefits of belonging to the GOP. The trope of the Democratic Party as a slave plantation has been a recurring feature of GOP rhetoric since at least 1968, when Richard Nixon mentioned it in an interview with Jet magazine; predating even this, black Republicans have used the phrase regularly since 1964. Such thinking is problematic\u2014often condescending and occasionally even bigoted, insinuating that Democrats have \u201cbought\u201d the black vote with \u201cgovernment handouts,\u201d and that African Americans are therefore unable to make their own rational political choices, thereby sidestepping the GOP\u2019s role in repelling black voters.\n\nMore broadly, however, both of these perspectives, like much of our understanding of black Republicans, are deeply unsatisfying. They tell us little about who black Republicans are, why they join the GOP, and what they really believe and why. Our assumptions about blacks in the Republican Party are teleological and ahistorical, informed by the Republican Party as it exists in the present; thus our views are often flat, lacking historical depth. Surely this understanding denies us the messiness that is at the heart of our beliefs and at the core of our personal politics: the ongoing debate that each one of us has with ourselves and with others about which politicians and policies we should support and about what ideologies we should embrace.\n\nOur implicit views of black Republicans\u2014either as strange alien creatures or as noble exceptions among their duped Democratic brethren\u2014reject the notion of political choice; too often we assume that blacks in America are Democrats by default; though not intentional, that assumption denies agency to an entire group of citizens. In this scenario, black Republicans are simultaneously invisible and hypervisible: isolated political misfits who provoke extreme reactions. These views, whether voiced by liberals or conservatives, of any race, are troublesome, muting reality and history and ignoring the complex ways that race and politics inter- sect in the United States. Simply put: our views obscure the fascinating diversity that exists within this \u201cstrange\u201d group known as black Republicans, obscuring their historical significance over the past three-quarters of a century; this, in turn, conceals a richer understanding not only of black politics but of American politics more generally.\n\nExploring black politics over nearly half a century, disrupts many of our perceptions about African Americans who support the GOP; at times we find not a peculiar group of blacks, desperate for white acceptance or out of touch with American realities but rather a movement of African Americans working for an alternative economic and civil rights movement. At other moments, we see a cadre of figures who make cynical concessions in order to maintain a modicum of power.\n\nMost of these black party members joined the Republican Party (or never left it) out of a belief in what they called \u201ctraditional\u201d conservatism: anticommunism, free market enterprise and capitalism, self-help and personal responsibility, limited government intervention, and a respect for authority, history, and precedent, along with Western institutions and traditions. In this sense, their beliefs were aligned with those of their white counterparts; and like their white counterparts, black Republicans\u2019 traditional conservatism also reflected their dissatisfaction with the Democratic liberalism of the New Deal and the Great Society. Reflecting the political diversity of the Republican Party more generally, there were three broad wings of black Republican thought, a great ideological gamut that encompassed liberal, moderate, and conservative factions. Equally important\u2014and especially baffling to critics\u2014most black Republicans, regardless of their ideological differences, believed that racial egalitarianism was in keeping with the Republican Party\u2019s principles. Indeed, the majority believed that in times of crisis, the government had a right to intervene on behalf of the nation\u2019s citizens; consequently, African American party members\u2019 traditional conservatism often included a belief in federal intervention in specific matters of civil rights and racial equality.\n\nThe boundaries between these manifestations of black conservatism are messy at best and at times fragile. First, black Republicans\u2019 brand of conservatism was an ideology rooted in nineteenth-century middle-class mores of respectability, built upon a faith in the Protestant work ethic and the lodestones of self-help, personal responsibility, morality, and political involvement. This was a model propagated by the black elite, as many scholars have convincingly argued, and was an imperfect challenge to white supremacy in an era of second-class citizenship; it was reflected in the economic and business ethos embodied by Booker T. Washington and the class privilege inherent in W.E.B. Du Bois\u2019s theory of a talented tenth uplifting the \u201cbest\u201d of the race.\n\nMoreover, in spite of conservatism\u2019s association with the right wing of the modern GOP, black Republicans have long seen the ideology as a legitimate solution, one that should be considered seriously in the struggle for racial equality. Thus, African Americans attempted to influence the direction of conservatism\u2014not to destroy it but rather to expand the boundaries of the ideology in order to include black needs and interests. This interpretation of conservatism has been flexible, by both definition and necessity, since issues of race, representation, and power guided black Republicans\u2019 actions. Perhaps even more remarkable, in the half century between 1936 and 1980 this pragmatic definition of conservatism was broad and elastic enough to encompass black citizens from across the political spectrum, including African American leaders outside of the Republican Party. As civil rights leader Jesse Jackson argued in 1978, African Americans \u201cmust pursue a strategy that prohibits one party from taking us for granted and another party from writing us off. The only protection we have against political genocide is to remain necessary.\u201d And as we shall see, even President Barack Obama, the scourge of Republicans everywhere, has sounded a lot like the black Republicans of the 1960s and 1970s since taking office in 2008.\n\nThere were three different waves of national black Republican thought and activity, a period that begins in 1936\u2014significant not only for the major political realignment of African American voters but also for the remarkable voting fluidity of the black electorate (see tables 1\u20133 in the appendix); in fact, through 1962, nearly a third of black voters pulled the lever for Republican candidates in midterm and presidential elections. The decision to nominate Barry Goldwater as the GOP presidential nominee in 1964 marks the beginning of the next wave of black party activity, as the Arizona senator\u2019s right-wing agenda sent shock- waves through black Republicans\u2019 ranks, motivating them to organize on a national scale in pursuit of intraparty reform. Many began to look to state and local politics, hoping to duplicate the electoral success of Massachusetts\u2019s Edward W. Brooke; and, as we will see, the black senator reinvigorated the idea of pragmatic politics for black Republicans, or, rather, the pursuit of power through party hierarchies in a way that could reconcile conservatism with African American needs. Likewise, they also looked to the Republican-led White House in the late 1960s, where a small band of black appointees was able to introduce an economic civil rights agenda.\n\nThe third and final wave reflects the confusion and chaos of the 1970s, a period in which black Republicans, ousted from the White House, turned to the Republican National Committee (RNC) to push party reform, still invested in a pragmatic approach to achieving power. Though their solidarity movement found moments of success, black Republicans also experienced colossal failures. Just as significant, the second and third wave of activity coincided with the passage of the major federal civil rights laws of the 1960s and a society-wide shift from explicit forms of racism to implicit and institutional forms of discrimination. The enactment and the enforcement of this legislation gave black Republicans a kind of freedom, or the leeway, to become more conservative, and adhere to mainstream party ideas about racial equality, if they so chose. This distinct outlook enabled black party members to concurrently embrace new types of nonpartisan strategies for wooing black voters and partisan techniques for nullifying the black vote. Our story ends in 1980, with black Republicans placing their hopes in the ascent of Ronald Reagan\u2014a man many of them had once rejected.\n\nIn no uncertain terms, black Republicans offer a dilemma of sorts; they were far more conservative than their Democratic counterparts but far less conservative than white reactionary Republicans. They identified with a traditional conservative ideology, to be sure, but they also identified with the various wings of the Republican Party. Above all else, most held fast to a pragmatic ideology that was informed by their day-to-day racial experience rather than by an abstract, dogmatic interpretation of American politics.\n\nExcerpted from The Loneliness of the Black Republican: Pragmatic Politics and the Pursuit of Power by Leah Wright Rigueur.

But it is to say that conservatives must shed negative stereotypes that, after all, have nothing to do with conservatism to begin with. My forthcoming book, Too Dumb to Fail, subtitled: \u201cHow the GOP Won Elections by Sacrificing Its Ideas (And How It Can Reclaim Its Conservative Roots)\u201d is largely about how conservatives can adapt to the 21st century.\n\nRegardless of his ethnicity, I think a young urbanite who manages his stock portfolio on his smart phone and then orders an Uber should be a conservative. And he might\u2014if when he thinks of \u201cconservative\u201d he pictures someone like American Enterprise Institute President and author Arthur Brooks. Someone who is sophisticated, tolerant, and thoroughly modern. But he won\u2019t if he associates that word with an image of, say, a fat, intolerant redneck. (This is not to suggest many Southerners fit this description. There are many things about the South I love. But this is a stereotype.)\n\nThe injection of Southerners into the Republican coalition\u2014a coalition they ultimately came to dominate\u2014couldn\u2019t help but change the image of the GOP. There were racial, cultural, political, and even religious implications. Republicans captured the South, yes, but the South also captured the GOP. There were no doubt many salutary benefits to this arrangement\u2014most obviously, an electoral boon that lasted for decades. But it also guaranteed we would eventually see a day of reckoning.\n\nFirst, though, some background. You\u2019ve probably heard of The Southern Strategy, but might not know exactly what it means, or how the Republican Party allegedly employed it. The Southern Strategy, As Mike Allen defined it in the Washington Post, \u201cdescribed Republican efforts to use race as a wedge issue\u2014on matters such as desegregation and busing\u2014to appeal to white southern voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe electorate is rapidly becoming less white, less rural, and better educated. Yet the GOP is still culturally synonymous with, well, white, rural, less-educated southern whites, who remain a major pillar of the party\u2019s support.\u201d\n\nWhether or not you accept that this was an intentional strategy, or just how things shook out, this much is true: Around 1964, the once reliably Democratic South started to become a Republican stronghold. We may differ about what this means, and about whether the GOP deserves culpability for stirring up racial animus in order to achieve it. (As Sean Trende notes, the trend actually began in the 1920s, and that long before civil rights became a hot-button political issue, \u201cFDR performed worse in the South in every election following his 1932 election.\u201d)\n\nIn one of the chapters, Too Dumb to Fail details the many ways the so-called Southern Strategy impacted conservative policy\u2014but the impact it had in terms of cultural signaling is among the most important, if more superficial, effects.\n\n(And here I\u2019m not talking about overt racism, which I think we all condemn, but instead subtle cultural customs and signals that may seem out of touch in an America that is increasingly cosmopolitan.)\n\nLet\u2019s take George W. Bush, the most successful Republican politician of the post-Southern Strategy, post-Reagan era. After losing a congressional race, George W. Bush (possibly as a reference to a much worse George Wallace line?) vowed \u201cnever to get out-countried again.\u201d This was smart politics for Bush, who ultimately went on to become President of the United States, but it helped reinforce the image of a Republican as someone who, well, looks and talks like George W. Bush. (I realize that Texas is often considered more Western than part of the \u201cDeep South,\u201d but you get my point.)\n\nThis brings us to today. As we all know, the demographics of the country are changing rapidly. The electorate is rapidly becoming less white, less rural, and better educated. Yet the GOP is still culturally synonymous with, well, white, rural, less-educated Southern whites, who remain a major pillar of the party\u2019s support. And so you get to the point where guys like Scott Walker and Rand Paul spend a week ducking questions about whether the Confederate flag should be flown on government property\u2026in 2015.\n\nSo here\u2019s what the GOP has to figure it out: How do they continue to get the Bubba vote while shedding appeals to the cultural symbolism of the past? How do they sell their conservative ideas about free markets, strong national defense, and conservative family values to 21st-century Americans?\n\nThe seeds of this challenge were partly planted when the GOP became the de facto party of the South\u2014with all the good and bad that that entails. And now the chickens have come to roost. As you watch Republicans scramble to address the changing political landscape\u2014some more nimbly than others\u2014keep in mind this is the backdrop.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:10.312+0000"}
{"entityId": 1889, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The White House looks to make a big push for infrastructure spending to unite the Democratic Party, fix our bridges and roads, and save Obama\u2019s legacy.\n\nPresident Obama won a major bipartisan victory in the Senate on Tuesday on trade promotion authority, clearing the way for approval in 2016 of the largest trade agreement in world history. But Obama has a problem: He won with the help of only 13 of the Senate\u2019s 44 Democrats. House Democrats are even more annoyed with their president, who has leaned into trade legislation more aggressively than he has other parts of his economic agenda.\n\nThose Democrats badly miscalculated this month. As Democratic Representative Gerald E. Connolly put it, their tactical vote to kill one of the party\u2019s priorities\u2014trade adjustment assistance (TAA), an important progressive program to help laid-off workers get retrained at community colleges\u2014was like the sheriff in Mel Brooks\u2019 Blazing Saddles putting a gun to his head and holding himself hostage.\n\nHaving lost what they mistakenly thought was their leverage, Democrats will now reverse themselves and vote this week for TAA, a program they think doesn\u2019t do nearly enough to protect workers from the harsh winds of global trade but is still better than nothing at all. And to make matters worse, they\u2019ll need the Republican congressional leadership to help them keep it.\n\nThis week\u2019s bill signing will hardly end the trade debate. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal itself won\u2019t be finalized until this fall and submitted for ratification until early next year\u2014just in time for the first presidential primaries. Hillary Clinton will have to keep bobbing and weaving on trade all the way to the 2016 general election.\n\nIn the meantime, Obama needs to figure out how to repair the rift in the Democratic Party and show the country that he can deliver something big for working people who don\u2019t see much for themselves in trade deals. White House officials tell me they are working hard to fund a big infrastructure bill, but they are doing so amid a new oppositional liberal climate.\n\nThe latest trouble began when large numbers of liberal Democrats started acting like the Tea Party Republicans who broke from the leadership of their party to oppose the trade deal. From the anti-establishment base of both parties came an understandable but ultimately irrational cry of defiance, like King Canute raising his arms to stop the global tides from rolling in.\n\nThat bipartisan resistance to reason\u2014whether genuine or political\u2014is problematic in the 21st century. Labor on the left and Tea Party isolationists on the right have made trade deals a scapegoat for the often-harsh consequences of globalization. But the global economy is not a threat; it\u2019s a fact. Our challenge isn\u2019t to stand athwart history yelling \u201cstop\u201d; it\u2019s to nudge it and shape it for the long-term interests of the country as a whole.\n\nWith the highway trust fund and tax reform both on the table, Obama should devote the rest of 2015 on the domestic side to finding the money for infrastructure.\n\nLike Obamacare and any other landmark legislation, TPP has winners and losers, but the winners aren\u2019t just pharmaceutical companies and other big corporations. Sharp reduction or elimination of tariffs and other barriers in Asia will, on balance, help American workers. For instance, removing Vietnam\u2019s 80 percent tariff on U.S. autos will almost certainly mean jobs for Detroit autoworkers over the next decade, and there\u2019s a big boost in TPP for the U.S.\u2019s job-creating heavy-equipment manufacturers (John Deere tractors are popular everywhere but often too expensive to buy with all the tariffs). The U.S. has major competitive advantages in services and IT that will be enhanced by the deal. And all of our new mom-and-pop online businesses will get a chance to export more, creating jobs.\n\nThe Obama administration made a big mistake in not letting the details circulate more widely. Secrecy breeds suspicion. It didn\u2019t help that the news media and social media are largely bored by global trade, which means that vested interests are often the only voices. And the current deal has shortcomings, especially in the enforcement provisions. As Senator Elizabeth Warren points out, the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) process makes it easy for corporations to bring claims against governments, but difficult for unions and environmentalists to do so. This needs to be fixed at the bargaining table over the next couple of months.\n\nBut whatever the deal\u2019s shortcomings, it is clearly advantageous to the U.S. to set the trade rules for 38 percent of the global economy. The alternative is to let China (not a party to the TPP) cut its own preferential deals with its neighbors, which would be terrible for Asian workers, the environment and U.S. strategic interests. Even with the enforcement problems, the deal is a big win for the international environmental and labor standards that, well, environmentalists and labor leaders have been arguing for since the 1970s.\n\nMichael Froman, the U.S. Trade Representative, tells me that on everything from intellectual property to Internet freedom to bans on expropriation, \u201cwe\u2019ve taken U.S. law as our starting point in these negotiations.\u201d Froman, a friend of Obama from their Harvard Law School days, has received a chilly reception from many congressional Democrats who are mindlessly leery of his background at Citibank. They should listen more to his logic, which suggests that it\u2019s not in our interests to set off a competition for which nations can have the fewest environmental and labor regulations and the lowest wages: \u201cWe\u2019re fighting to see a race to the top in the global economy, not a race to the bottom that we can\u2019t win and shouldn\u2019t even try to run.\u201d\n\nOf course the debate is not really about a logical assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of TPP. It\u2019s about the financial and emotional body blows inflicted on organized labor and middle-class Americans in recent decades\u2014blows that Obama understands abstractly but has not countered with sustained legislative efforts. His many speeches about jobs and infrastructure\u2014the same thing, since construction jobs can\u2019t be outsourced\u2014have been necessary but hardly sufficient.\n\nSo far, Obama hasn\u2019t played good poker on his economic agenda. He should have recognized that the Republicans needed a trade deal to show the country they could get something positive done, then linked TPP to a jobs program.\n\nFortunately there\u2019s still time for the president to put his nose to the grindstone on jobs in the same way he has with trade. With the highway trust fund and tax reform both on the table, Obama should devote the rest of 2015 on the domestic side to finding the money for infrastructure. Unlike immigration reform or gun safety, this is achievable with Republicans.\n\nFew Republicans recall that the GOP was founded in the 1850s on what were then known as \u201cinternal improvements\u201d as well as opposition to slavery in the territories. But many seem ready for creative policy-making on the issue. Representative Barbara Comstock and other influential conservatives I\u2019ve spoken with are open to a big transportation bill if a way can be found to pay for it other than an increase in the gas tax.\n\nThe best solution (after a gas tax hike) lies in repatriated earnings. As Democratic Representative Dan Kildee explains: If American companies that have fled overseas were taxed at a low rate (well below the capital gains rate) on their repatriated earnings, the receipts would fund as much as $500 billion in infrastructure investment. Matched by the private sector (quite likely, actually), about $1 trillion would be available over 10 years for rebuilding the roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, rails and sewage systems of the United States\u2014enough (with the spinoff businesses) to offer jobs to millions of the unemployed and propel a whole generation of older displaced construction workers to retirement with some dignity. With interest rates still at historic lows, we have an historic opportunity to lock in huge projects that will quickly pay for themselves.\n\nRepublicans have other ideas for funding the transportation bill and establishing an infrastructure bank. Several have offered a deal involving offshore drilling rights. Or maybe it can be part of a Grand Bargain with Representative Paul Ryan on tax reform.\n\nWhatever the solution, it should be sold not as stimulus\u2014a dead-on-arrival argument with the Republican Congress\u2014but as a matter of strength and competitiveness and national greatness. China spends 10 times as much on infrastructure as the U.S. as a percentage of its GDP. Do we really want China to have a better infrastructure than ours?\n\nOf course \u201cinfrastructure\u201d sounds like a snooze. Many Americans don\u2019t even know what it means. So the domestic agenda of the end of the Obama era is better framed as simply: Rebuild America.\n\nThinking big this way is terribly out of fashion in cynical, polarized Washington. But both parties have an interest in using the bipartisanship of the trade agreement as a model for the huge infrastructure investments that can help rebuild this country. Republican members need to show the public that their congressional majority can keep working positively, as well as bring home long-overdue local projects to their constituents. Democratic members, frustrated by their loss on trade, need a big win for working people and for themselves. So does the president.\n\nIn fact, his legacy depends on it.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:10.470+0000"}

Since 1990, the state's Hispanic population has increased eight-fold, while the Asian-American population has quadrupled.

Reported spending by \u201cdark money\u201d groups -- 501(c) organizations that don\u2019t disclose their donors to the public -- jumped from $135 million in 2010 to nearly $170 million in 2014, despite only a modest increase in the overall cost of the election.\n\nDark money didn\u2019t just grow in 2014, though -- it morphed in a way that will almost certainly have a major bearing on the upcoming 2016 elections. In three Senate races -- two of them being the pivotal Kentucky and North Carolina contests -- some of the biggest spenders were a new breed of dark money organization: ones that are geared specifically towards the election of a single candidate.\n\nFor example, the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition spent $7.6 million opposing Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes \u2014 all to the benefit of Senate Minority (soon to be Majority) Leader Mitch McConnell. That\u2019s more than any other organization, including parties and super PACs, spent in the race. But unlike those other groups, KOC -- a 501(c)(4) \u201csocial welfare\u201d organization that isn\u2019t supposed to have politics as its primary purpose -- didn\u2019t have to disclose a single a donor.\n\nThe group was founded in 2008 by operatives who would later have ties to the dark money powerhouse Crossroads GPS. But the group never raised much, if any, money -- until 2014.\n\nWith the day-to day-operations of the group in the hands of a former McConnell campaign staffer, KOC suddenly had enough money to buy more than 12,000 ads, more than all but the candidates themselves. Every single ad run by the group and every single video on the group\u2019s YouTube page mentions either McConnell -- the beneficiary of this group\u2019s activities -- or Grimes, according to a detailed report by the Center for Public Integrity.\n\nIn North Carolina and Oklahoma, Carolina Rising and Oklahomans for a Conservative Future were created by people close to the candidates they supported months before each group began spending millions in the races.\n\nAnd really, why wouldn\u2019t a candidate want their own dark money group operating as an extension of their campaign? The benefits extend well beyond the fact that such a group wouldn\u2019t be required to disclose its donors -- whether those donors be wealthy individuals, corporations or unions -- to the public.\n\nFirst, consider how long it would take for the IRS to actually catch wind of such a group\u2019s existence. Here\u2019s the scenario: Operatives close to a 2016 presidential hopeful set up a new 501(c)(4) in January, 2015, and begin collecting unlimited contributions. The first piece of paper that organization would be required to file with the IRS would not be submitted until November 15, 2016 -- precisely one week after the presidential elections.\n\nThis delay is a consequence of two factors. First, 501(c)(4) organizations and other non-charitable 501(c)s are not required to notify the IRS of their existence before they begin operating. It\u2019s referred to as \u201cself-declaring,\u201d and it is perfectly legal. Just open your doors for business and then, when the time comes, file your annual returns with the IRS.\n\nThose forms are normally due five-and-a-half months after the end of a group\u2019s fiscal year, making the due date for our theoretical organization\u2019s paperwork mid-May. But all organizations get an automatic three-month extension as a matter of course, along with another optional three-month extension, which most organizations take.\n\nPut that all together, and you could operate your 501(c)(4) for a year, then wait another eleven-and-a-half months to file, and in November of 2016, all the IRS would know about your organization would be what you did in 2015. By the time you filed your 2016 returns in late 2017, you could have long since closed up shop. The fact is, we may have no way of knowing who funded the main presidential candidates next cycle until the election is long over.\n\nThe fact is, we may have no way of knowing who funded the main presidential candidates next cycle until the election is long over.\n\nCompare this to super PACs, which can also raise unlimited funds and spend heavily on politics. A super PAC has to file a statement of organization with the Federal Election Commission within 10 days after raising or spending $1,000. This filing includes names and contact information for the people in charge of the group\u2019s operations, as well as other details.\n\nAnd these statements are posted immediately to the FEC\u2019s website, as are the regular detailed financial reports that super PACs are required to file throughout the year. By contrast, the IRS still has no public database, let alone a searchable one, of annual returns they receive from 501(c) organizations. To get the documents, a member of the public has to participate in a ridiculous system that requires faxing or mailing printed forms to the IRS, which will send the hard-copy filings 60 days later; alternatively, one can choose to pay more than $2,000 -- no joke -- for monthly DVDs that come in the mail.\n\nIf you\u2019re keeping score at home, that\u2019s 10 days for super PAC information that\u2019s posted online with downloadable data, compared to more than 23 months for (sketchy) 501(c) organization info, on hard copy or DVD only.\n\nBy starting in early 2015, our new 501(c)(4) can strategize directly with the candidate they will ultimately support in the elections, despite federal election rules against coordination between outside groups and candidates. That\u2019s because none of those hopefuls will actually declare their candidacy until sometime in late 2015 or early 2016. This allows for months of conferring between candidates-to-be and nominally independent, nonpolitical social welfare organizations.\n\nThis element of non=coordinated coordination is present with super PACs too, and some of 2016\u2019s not-yet-candidates already have their very own such groups \u2013 think Hillary Clinton and John Bolton. Still, there\u2019s a world of difference between the disclosure we\u2019ll get from them and what we\u2019ll learn from the dark money groups.\n\nWhat this means is that in addition to the super PACs that have been acting in some cases essentially as extensions of campaigns, there are now darker pools of candidate-specific funding to which corporations or individuals who wish to remain publicly anonymous can contribute.\n\nEither way, you can be sure the candidates will know who the donors are. They\u2019ll know who they need to thank, and whose calls they need to answer once they\u2019re in office.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:11.182+0000"}

The drive for an amendment began after the Tennessee Supreme Court in 2000 ruled that three out of four restrictions on abortion passed by the legislature and challenged by Planned Parenthood and the ACLU were medically unnecessary and posed an \u201cundue burden\u201d on women, rendering them unconstitutional. \u201cA woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy is a vital part of the right to privacy guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution,\u201d the judges wrote in their opinion.\n\nTo get on the ballot, Amendment 1 had to pass both houses of the Tennessee legislature, the General Assembly and the state senate, not once but twice, the first time by majority vote and then by two-thirds, and in consecutive years. With Republicans a supermajority in the House and a majority in the Senate, victory was assured by 2011 with the vote scheduled for this November. It is the state\u2019s marquee race, with both sides understanding Amendment 1 could be a model that could extend far beyond Tennessee should it pass.\n\nIt says, \u201cNothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion. The people retain the right through their elected state representatives and state senators to enact, amend, or repeal statutes regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest or when necessary to save the life of the mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Amendment 1 does pass, it will open the floodgate and they will be passing every imaginable restriction they can come up with,\u201d says Jeff Teague with Planned Parenthood of Middle and East Tennessee.\n\nThe first sentence is straightforward, but the second sentence is craftily written to leave the impression that exemptions are either in place, or could easily be put in place. \u201cThe language on the ballot is deceptive and deliberately so,\u201d says Herron. What Amendment 1 would do is allow lawmakers to write and pass laws restricting abortion without having to worry about their constitutionality on the state level. \u201cIf you watch the Tennessee state legislature closely, it\u2019s pretty clear they\u2019re all about banning abortion with no exceptions,\u201d says Steven Hershkowitz, spokesman for the Vote No on 1 campaign. \u201cIf Amendment 1 is approved, they could pass personhood and they wouldn\u2019t even have to amend the constitution.\u201d\n\nConstitutional amendments to declare the fetus a person from the moment of conception have failed in Mississippi and Colorado, and a modified version is on the ballot again this November in Colorado. Generally voters are wary of these amendments as too extreme, which is why the Tennessee approach is so different, and from the pro-choice perspective, so dangerous in the power it extends to lawmakers. \u201cIf Amendment 1 does pass, it will open the floodgate and they will be passing every imaginable restriction they can come up with,\u201d says Jeff Teague with Planned Parenthood of Middle and East Tennessee.\n\nThat\u2019s the point, says Mallory Quigley with the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. \u201cPassing Amendment 1 is critical to advancing any lifesaving legislation in the state, including the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to stop abortion after five months. This is a compassionate, popular measure that has already passed 13 states and the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nIn May, Vanderbilt University polled this question: \u201cThis fall, Tennessee residents will be asked to vote on an amendment to the state constitution that would give the state legislature more power to regulate abortions. Do you favor giving the state legislature the constitutional authority to regulate abortions, or do you oppose this?\n\nOnly 23 percent favored and 71 percent opposed, a ratio of over 3-to-1 against Amendment 1. But opponents take little comfort from these lopsided numbers. It\u2019s one thing to win the intellectual argument, that Amendment 1 is not about whether you\u2019re for or against abortion; it\u2019s about government power, and quite another to win on the ground where the energy and the passion and the foot soldiers are on the pro-life side. \u201cRepublicans are using churches all over the state in a massive drive,\u201d says Herron, a former United Methodist minister, \u201cand the latest polling I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s a tossup.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:11.444+0000"}
{"entityId": 1893, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "He\u2019s been hammered for going around Congress with executive orders. But he\u2019s within his authority\u2014and he should go further on voting and transparency to make government work better.\n\nWith Congress paralyzed, President Obama has promised to use his \u201cpen and phone\u201d to overcome the ongoing dysfunction and get some work done. And the White House has already acted several times to help improve America\u2019s economy. But such policies, no matter how valuable, will achieve little if we do not fix our broken democracy.\n\nAllow me to suggest some ideas for how the president can do just that.\n\nFirst, some historical context. Presidents have long acted within their authority, from Jefferson\u2019s purchase of Louisiana without consulting Congress to Lincoln\u2019s freeing the slaves by proclamation. In recent decades, at a time of divided government, presidents have found ways to act in the arena of domestic and social policy. As a young Harvard professor, Elena Kagan identified President Reagan as the pioneer of the current trend. President Clinton extended the president\u2019s role as originator of creative executive policymaking. As Clinton\u2019s chief speechwriter, I was deeply involved in his administration\u2019s executive action program, which used tools creatively to catalyze major policy change. All those announcements in the Rose Garden, from school uniforms to tobacco regulation? Those were executive action, designed to call attention to an issue, prod Congress, or achieve results. We even tried to enact campaign finance reform by executive agency action. The plan fizzled, but helped keep the issue alive\u2014and built momentum that eventually led to the McCain-Feingold law. President Bush did the same thing.\n\nNow comes Obama. Is his second-term strategy overreach? Hardly. Indeed, the president has issued executive orders at a slower pace than all his recent predecessors. And he is not trying to outsmart a hostile Congress. The legislative branch isn\u2019t oppositional; it\u2019s paralyzed. It can\u2019t pass good bills, bad bills, or any bills.\n\nIn the face of divided and dysfunctional government, it\u2019s little wonder that presidents have found ways to push policy and prod the bureaucracy without waiting for congressional action or approval that may never come. But Obama\u2019s executive orders have not yet focused on ways to make government work better.\n\nMy colleagues and I have suggested 15 steps the administration can take to overcome dysfunction, strengthen democracy, secure justice, and further the rule of law. The president should take them. And he has explicit legal authority to do so.\n\nStart with voting. The president recently spoke out on the issue: \u201cThe first words put to paper in our American story tell us that all of us are created equal,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 That makes it wrong to pass laws that make it harder for any eligible citizen to vote, especially because every citizen doesn\u2019t just have the right to vote, they have a responsibility to vote.\u201d But his own administration could do much more to help voters exercise their franchise. The National Voter Registration Act, enacted in 1993, is known as the \u201cmotor voter\u201d law because it uses DMV offices and other agencies to register voters. The law authorizes federal agencies to help, too. States have been asking for action for years. Remarkably, federal agencies routinely have said no. Obama could reverse that with the stroke of a pen. Hundreds of thousands could be registered by the Veterans Administration, United States Citizenship and Immigration Service, Department of Defense, and other units if they are designated as voter registration agencies. He also should convene his Cabinet heads and ask them what else they can do to boost participation.\n\nLike many second-term presidents, Obama is discovering that he has many powerful tools at his disposal to make progress toward his goals. He should apply them to our broken democracy.\n\nCriminal justice reform is another area ripe for presidential action. The United States has 5 percent of the world\u2019s population, but 25 percent of its prisoners. That\u2019s a scandal. Policy on autopilot is one reason why. Washington sends billions of dollars to states for criminal justice, but the funds can have perverse consequences, inadvertently steering police and prosecutors toward unwise policies. The president should order an immediate review of the array of criminal justice grant programs. The goal: When possible, shift them toward what is known as \u201cSuccess-Oriented Funding .\u201d This reliance on metrics, funding only what works\u2014the modernizing reforms of which the administration is so proud in education and health care\u2014would extend to criminal justice.\n\nHow about the $300 million of money from anonymous campaign spenders now hurtling toward our elections? The president could act there, too. A few years ago he floated the idea of requiring companies that bid on government contracts to disclose their campaign spending. Congress howled. At last, a cause that could rouse it to action: defending the honor of campaign contributors. It passed a provision blocking such a move. But the law allows the government to require disclosure by firms that are actually awarded contracts. That basic anti-corruption move would do much to shine light on \u201cdark money.\u201d\n\nAs for fighting terrorism, controversy rages\u2014how much, for example, it should be vacuuming up information about our phone calls. Nonetheless, the White House could take steps to disclose more of the government\u2019s activity. Since September 11, 2001, much of the government\u2019s aggressive counterterrorism moves have relied on legal opinions and directives, even by courts, that are themselves secret. That makes no sense. These documents don\u2019t reveal terrorist hideaways but legal doctrines that should be the subject of public debate. The president could order the attorney general to lead a careful government-wide review of such secret laws with an eye toward declassifying as much as possible.\n\nWait a minute: Didn\u2019t liberals spend a decade blasting Dick Cheney\u2019s claims that the president had \u201cmonarchical notions of prerogative\u201d? Didn\u2019t conservatives, who now denounce the \u201cimperial presidency,\u201d defend its right to use \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d without congressional approval? It\u2019s all enough to give hypocrisy a bad name. The steps we propose are all authorized by law. None would be secret. When Obama oversteps, as in his defense of the NSA spying program, he will be called to account by Congress, courts, and the public\u2014and he should.\n\nBut it should not require a defense of torture, or torturing the Constitution, to see that the president is well within his authority to act when he can. All public officials have a duty to try to advance the public good. None of these modest proposals will magically transform Washington, unfreeze Congress, or upend so many of the problems facing our political system. That still requires good old-fashioned legislation or new rulings from the Supreme Court\u2014and perhaps a new justice or two. But like many second-term presidents, Obama is discovering that he has many powerful tools at his disposal to make progress toward his goals. He should apply them to our broken democracy. That would be the best vindication of what Alexander Hamilton, writing in the Federalist Papers, said would inevitably be a key source of strength: \u201cenergy in the executive.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:12.274+0000"}

A federal prosecutor finally named him in open court on Tuesday after his friend, Ana Alliegro, pled guilty to campaign finance violations.\n\nRivera is a Cuban-American from South Florida who served one term in Congress from 2011-2013.

But what might finally take the slippery South Floridian down is his involvement in a bizarre scheme to back a candidate in the 2012 Democratic primary for his seat.\n\nIn an attempt to weaken Democrat Joe Garcia, who eventually defeated Rivera in the general election, the Republican congressman recruited Justin Lamar Sternad to run against Garcia in the primary and funded Sternad\u2019s campaign. Throughout the campaign, Sternad, a political unknown, repeatedly attacked Garcia in mail pieces, which were funded by roughly $82,000 in illegal campaign contributions.\n\nRivera never dealt with Sternad directly. Instead, Alliegro ran the Sternad campaign. When she first came under investigation, she fled to Nicaragua, where she was arrested in March.

{"entityId": 1895, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "If Republicans win the Senate\u2014and they probably will\u2014then they\u2019ll have to quickly prove they have the guts to govern. This is how they can do that.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, President Obama declared, \"I am not on the ballot this fall. Michele\u2019s pretty happy about that. But make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Chris Cillizza called it \u201c28 words that Democrats really wish President Obama didn\u2019t say.\u201d\n\nWhy? The assumption is that President Obama is a drain on Democrats desperate to survive his unpopular numbers in key states. Democrats have been anxious not to nationalize the election as a referendum on President Obama. Every Democratic candidate is trying to run, in essence, as an independent. Will it work?\n\nA month out from the mid-term elections and no one knows who will control the Senate in January 2015. All models favor Republicans to varying degrees, but the world changes fast. Who would have thought a couple of months ago that beheading would be a hot topic of discussion in this cycle?\n\nMy guess\u2014and it\u2019s just that\u2014is that either Democrats manage to hold onto the Senate or most of these close races break Republican. For my money, Colorado is the real litmus test. It\u2019s been a tough state for Republicans of late and I\u2019d bet that if Cory Gardner beats Udall, the incumbent Democrat, then we\u2019ll see Iowa, Alaska, Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana all going Republican\u2014plus one \u201csurprise,\u201d most likely New Hampshire.\n\nIf that happens, it will obviously mean this will be considered a major \u201cwave\u201d election. If so, it will be unusual for lack of an obvious unifying national agenda, other than the President\u2019s unpopularity. The most dramatic wave cycles have featured an obvious thematic, like the 1994 \u201cContract for America,\u201d the 2002 war on terror, or the 2010 reaction to Obamacare.\n\nTwo of those also had a leader pushing the agenda. In 1994, Newt Gingrich was relatively unknown, with six out of ten voters having no opinion of him, which gave him the appeal of the most powerful word in American advertising: new. In 2002, President Bush spent the last three weeks of the election campaigning in almost every key state.\n\nIn 2010, Republicans gained 63 House seats and seven Senate seats\u2014the largest number of seats changing parties since 1948\u2014but interestingly it lacked a prominent figure articulating a change message. Instead there was the emergence of a Tea Party movement that brought many traditionally low-propensity voters to the polls.\n\nAs with a new president, there will likely be a short window of goodwill in which to act.\n\nIf this year turns out to be a wave, it will seem to lack both a leader and a unifying agenda. This may be an argument for precisely why it won\u2019t be a wave, or it could be that dissatisfaction on multiple levels combined with President Obama\u2019s low favorables are serving to unify and motivate support for Republicans. It appears that no Democratic candidate in any of the key Senate seats will campaign with President Obama, which is pretty astonishing given that two years ago he won by over 5 million votes.\n\nBut if Republicans do control Congress, it\u2019s essential they seize the moment and present a governing agenda or it surely will lead to disaster in 2016. As is often noted this year, each of these Senate races is different, but there\u2019s no reason to believe that agreement on a body of legislation couldn\u2019t be crafted. As with a new president, there will likely be a short window of goodwill in which to act.\n\nSo what could that governing agenda look like?\n\nFirst, it\u2019s essential that an alternative to Obamacare be passed. This will accomplish two goals: it will end discussion that Republicans don\u2019t have an alternative and it will force the President and Democrats into defending a program that still is unpopular. As is often noted by Obamacare supporters, more voters support changing Obamacare than repealing it. A new Republican Congress needs to prove that\u2019s a false choice by passing a health care reform bill that has the most popular elements of Obamacare, like a ban on pre-existing conditions and no cap on lifetime benefits. The plan unveiled last January by Hatch, Coburn and Burr is a good foundation.\n\nPresident Obama has vetoed only two bills, a record low. President G.W. Bush vetoed 12, Bill Clinton 27, George H.W, Bush 44, Ronald Reagan 78. Clearly he would veto an alternative to Obamacare, but who\u2019s to say he would keep unified Democrat support when there was an alternative that, if crafted properly, could appear more popular? In any event, it would change the nature of the discussion from the president accusing Congress of doing nothing, to defending his legislation. That shift in the dynamic is essential to give Republicans a positive voice in the debate on solutions.\n\nNext, the passage of a comprehensive jobs bill is essential for Republicans. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio has put together a plan that would serve well as a blueprint. It\u2019s not a bill but a statement of goals with some specifics that could gain support from Democrats as well as Republicans.\n\nIn 2009, the Stimulus Bill was the newly elected President Obama\u2019s answer to the job crisis. Six years later, there are still a million-plus fewer full-time jobs, household income continues to decline and poverty has increased dramatically. Supporters of the president argue these trends are inevitable and the Stimulus made a terrible situation better. We can argue that but at this point it doesn\u2019t matter. What\u2019s key is that a Republican Congress respond with a sweeping alternative.\n\nPassing a new jobs bill will signal that Republicans don\u2019t buy the White House happy talk that Americans are doing well economically. Most Americans aren\u2019t, and the president and his supporters alienate themselves when they insist people are too dumb to realize how they are better off now than they were five years ago.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner addressed this in an underreported but excellent speech at the American Enterprise Institute on September 19. He described the situation bluntly: \u201cFlat wages, higher prices, a six-year slog to regain the jobs that were lost during the recessions, and millions continue to ask the question: Where are the jobs?\u201d\n\nRepublicans will also have to find time fore foreign policy and, as Hugh Hewitt noted in his call for action by a Republican Congress, a new Defense Appropriation Bill should be part of a new agenda. We\u2019re at war and no one is credibly making the case that the Obama scheduled defense reductions should continue. Let Democrats oppose, if they so choose, and the president veto. But I suspect that a compromise would be reached and it would pass.\n\nThen there\u2019s immigration and border security. This is the toughest item from a political standpoint, and the one I\u2019d address after an Obamacare alternative, jobs bill and defense authorization, if only because of its likelihood to split Republicans and stall. If Republicans can work together and prove they can provide alternatives to key issues, they will both gain internal confidence and build national goodwill. These will be essential to dealing with this incredibly divisive issue.\n\nIf nothing else, we\u2019ve learned that addressing border security is an essential first step to any immigration solution. It will be impossible to pass any version of immigration reform without addressing the border issue.\n\nBut beyond all this, Republicans need to prove two points: that they are on the side of the vast majority of Americans who have been left behind in the Obama \u201crecovery\u201d and that they are capable of serving as a governing party. That may seem simple, and it is, but it won\u2019t be easy. But there\u2019s an historic opportunity to prove that good policy is good politics.\n\nThe stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. If Republicans do control Congress and fall into stagnation or, worse, internal bickering with members playing to segments of the party rather than a unifying dynamic, it will all but guarantee the election of another Democratic president in 2016. If you are given a chance to govern and fail, it\u2019s hard to argue you deserve more power. That\u2019s the problem President Obama faces today. If Republicans blow it, it will quickly become their problem.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:13.078+0000"}

In politics though, most have seen him as an oddity at best, if not an outright lightweight. His decision to enter the Republican race this year was met with similar disdain. Pundits thought he would be a flash in the pan\u2014a momentary media darling\u2014whose lack of substance and irreverent ways would eventually catch up with him. Many argued that he would follow a similar trajectory to some of the more unlikely 2012 Republican candidates like Herman Cain (remember him?). We thought this as well.\n\nSo began Trump-mentum 2015\u2014and it was the \u201cflash\u201d we\u2019d all been expecting. He rose from 0.4 percent of the vote when Ipsos first started including him in our candidate list in March, to 9.7 percent the week of June 16 when he announced. However, since July 25 he has taken a commanding lead\u2014and kept it. He is outstripping his rival candidates by more than 20 points, and polling comfortably at 30 percent or higher.\n\nPerhaps most impressively, this high rating has held\u2014even increased\u2014despite behavior that normally turns off voters: bombastic statements about his own worth and accomplishments, divisive statements about immigration, and more.\n\nSo is Trump just a summer fling or something more serious? Does he have a real chance to be the Republican nominee?\n\nLet\u2019s examine the evidence by assessing each argument against Trump securing the nomination, and its relative strength.\n\n1. THE \u201cIT\u2019S TOO EARLY\u201d ARGUMENT\n\nThese pollsters say: Forget the polls (for now). They are misleading this far out from Election Day, and are dangerous false positives. People are not thinking seriously about the election now, so views are more impressionistic and subject to media buzz than grounded or usefully predictive of an election outcome. We always warn our clients that at this stage it is way too early to discern much from the polls.\n\nSource: Ipsos analysis of American presidential polling data 1980-2012\n\nThis is illustrated well in the table above, which shows the difference between published poll data (using poll aggregator sites) and the final election outcome at various points prior to Election Day: We see that while the average poll variance from the final outcome one week before Election Day was just 1.7 percent, the variance a year out was almost 8 percent.\n\nThis data is a cautionary note that we probably shouldn\u2019t pay too much attention to poll data this far from Election Day. Based on this evidence alone, we would discount Trump\u2019s chances\u2026 but this is not our only evidence of course.\n\nArgument strength: Pretty good\n\nOur odds for Trump getting the nomination based on this argument alone : 10/90\n\n2. THE \u201cBUT HE\u2019S A FAUX PAS MACHINE\u201d ARGUMENT\n\nConventional wisdom tells us that political indiscretions like \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero because he was captured\u2014I like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d or \u201cThey\u2019re rapists\u201d will sink a campaign. They did with George Allen and \u201cmacaca\u201d in 2006, and with Rick Perry\u2019s 2011 Republican debate \u201coops\u201d moment.\n\nThis is harder to quantify but a very important qualitative factor in assessment. So far he has survived! This by itself is impressive, and even seems to be some of his appeal. Perhaps we have bypassed the era when an embarrassing online video is sufficient fodder to sink a campaign?\n\nWhether this continues remains to be seen; perhaps enough people aren\u2019t yet paying attention.\n\nArgument strength: Decent\n\nOur odds for Trump getting the nomination based on this argument alone : 20/80\n\n3. THE \u201cMORE AIR THAN SUBSTANCE\u201d ARGUMENT\n\nThis argument goes: Trump is a media phenom. The \u201cKim Kardashian\u201d of politics: all air and no substance. We\u2019ve heard of him a lot, but we\u2019re not quite sure who he really is, or what he stands for. He is polling well because of name recognition alone, but that will soon fade when people start to consider the man himself. However, the data does not support this at all.\n\nSource: Ipsos\n\nA good baseline measure for candidate viability is what we call a \u201cfam-fav\u201d analysis: familiarity and favorability measures for each candidate. Typically, candidates early on in their campaigns struggle most with name recognition: those who people recognize do better (than they would or will otherwise) solely because people recognize their names (familiarity) and indicate in polls that they would vote for them. By pairing this with data on how favorably people feel about the candidate, we\u2019re often able to identify early likely winners and \u201cduds.\u201d\n\nFor example, if we look at the 2011/12 Republican primary candidates, Romney had the strongest fam/fav combination\u2014and he ultimately took the candidacy. Comparatively, Herman Cain, while polling as well-known\u2014was indeed a \u201cflash in the pan\u201d given his weak favorability scores.\n\nAs such, we would expect that while Trump\u2019s familiarity levels would be very high, his favorability would be comparatively lower due to his non-political background and blustering persona. However, we can see in the chart above that Trump enjoys very high fam/fav ratings and indeed clusters with \u201cserious\u201d politicians Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton\u2014far outstripping all his Republican opponents on both familiarity and favorability measures.\n\nIt seems there is substance here, perhaps more than we initially thought. Established recognition and favorable perceptions that come from outside politics (especially powerful, perhaps, in this period of strong anti-Washington sentiment) puts him on \u201cfam-fav\u201d par with senior Democrat politicians Clinton and Biden\u2014and means that there is more here than it appears.\n\nArgument strength: Not so good\n\nOur odds for Trump getting the nomination based on this argument alone : 60/40\n\n4. THE \u201cWE\u2019VE SEEN THIS ALL BEFORE\u201d ARGUMENT\n\nThe rise and fall of a host of Republican candidates from the 2012 election really says it all. Both Perry and Gingrich got about six weeks in the sun, although none pulled as far ahead nor grew the lead like Trump has over the past weeks. The 2011/12 nomination cycle also had a strong \u201cestablishment\u201d favorite in Mitt Romney, whose early numbers tracked high.\n\nSo, not a direct comparison to 2015/16, but if we learned anything from the last Republican nomination fight, it is that we can cycle through candidates very quickly.\n\nArgument strength: Very good\n\nOur odds for Trump getting the nomination based on this argument alone : 5/95\n\n5. THE \u201cTRUMP\u2019S VOTERS WON\u2019T SHOW UP AT THE POLLS\u201d ARGUMENT\n\nThis theory suggests that Trump is attracting the virtually engaged but that they won\u2019t show up on Election Day; that they are \u201cunengaged\u201d and less likely to vote. But evidence shows the contrary.\n\nTypically, voter turnout is explained by a series of concentric circles, such as the image below: increasingly smaller proportions of the population turn out to vote depending on the type of election. Critically, the voter profile also changes as we focus our sights on different voter types, with Republicans more likely to actually turn up on Election Day than Democrats.\n\nSource: Ipsos\n\nFor primaries in particular, it is generally a far more ideologically active \u201cbase\u201d that casts a vote compared to the larger\u2014and typically broader more centrist\u2014group of Republicans who vote on Election Day, for the presidential candidates.\n\nWhile this would naturally support a \u201cnontypical\u201d and base-friendly candidate like Trump, the argument has also been posited that Trump\u2019s voters themselves are \u201cnontraditional\u201d Republicans and so are less likely to actually vote.\n\nSo, with this knowledge, and our working hypothesis that Trump supporters are unlikely to show up at the polls, we would expect to see his share of the vote shrink when we move from all Republicans, to those who are registered, and will actually vote. This, however, is not at all the case:\n\nSource: Ipsos\n\nThere is little difference in support over time among these groups, suggesting that supporter turnout will not hold Trump back from winning the nomination.\n\nArgument strength: Meh\n\nOur odds for Trump getting the nomination based on this argument alone : 70/30\n\n6. THE \u201cBUT TRUMP DOESN\u2019T KNOW WHAT AMERICA WANTS\u201d ARGUMENT\n\nThis is a more qualitative and subjective argument, but fundamentally suggests that Trump just doesn\u2019t understand the country or the Republicans well enough to be a serious contender, much less win the nomination. This argument has been made by fellow candidates Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Rick Santorum, as well as conservative columnists like George Will, Erick Erickson, and Matt Lewis.\n\nTo us, this argument couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Indeed, the polling shows the exact opposite. That Trump is actually on to something. That his rants against immigrants and other assorted groups is tapping into a pervasive latent nativism\u2014rather than recent GOP primaries that focused on terrorism, abortion, and family values. And the data on this is absolutely striking.\n\nSource: Ipsos\n\nIndeed, the Republican base is much more likely to not \u201cidentify with America\u201d and to feel like a \u201cstranger in their own country.\u201d More impressively, 58 percent of Americans independent of political party agree that \u201cmore and more, I don\u2019t identify with what America has become.\u201d This is very fertile ground for a populist of Trump\u2019s ilk.\n\nArgument strength: Terrible\n\nOur odds for Trump getting the nomination based on this argument alone : 99/1\n\nCONCLUSION? DON\u2019T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF THE DONALD\n\nTrump is a genuine contender in this race. More importantly, his nativist messaging resonates with the Republican base. Contrary to the pundits, there is a method to his madness. And, more broadly, there is room for his brand of populism.\n\nOf course, it is still early and most people aren\u2019t paying much attention to the race yet\u2014so if we had to put money on it today, we\u2019d still bet against Trump winning the nomination, but not by much. The biggest X-factor in all this is Trump himself. He might tire of the political thing, turning his energies elsewhere.\n\nSo Trump is not just a summer fling. Should we all be getting the wedding invite? Maybe! We wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it showed up in the mail sometime mid-year 2016.\n\nSource: Ipsos\n\nCliff Young is president of Ipsos Public Affairs US, and an adjunct professor at both Johns Hopkins and Columbia Universities.

But is it just because he\u2019s gay?\n\nIn my May story about Carl DeMaio, an openly gay Republican running for Congress in San Diego, I outlined the various troubles his sexuality\u2014or allegations about his sexuality\u2014seemed to have caused him throughout his political career. Still, none of the chatter about DeMaio's character had prevented him from mounting his current campaign, and it has been a competitive one at that. But with just a few weeks until election day, DeMaio has been caught in a web of charges from a former staffer that forced him into a he-said-he-said argument which threatens to sideline his race in the home stretch.\n\nOn Friday, CNN reported that Todd Bosnich, a former member of DeMaio's staff, had accused DeMaio of making inappropriate sexual advances, \"massaging and kissing his neck and groping him\" without permission, and even masturbating in front of him. \"I came over to his office, door was open. And he was masturbating,\" Bosnich told the publication. \"I saw his hand, his penis in his hand, and he had a smile on his face. And as soon as I came over he was looking at me.\"\n\nBosnich also claims DeMaio \"grabbed my crotch\" while the two sat in the candidate's car. Bosnich alleges that when he finally came forward to DeMaio's campaign manager, Tommy Knepper, he was not taken seriously, and was made to feel as though he had invited DeMaio's behavior. Bosnich says that he was fired, offered a position at the local Republican party, and asked to sign a nondisclosure agreement for a cool $50,000.\n\nDeMaio categorically denied the accusations, calling Bosnich \"clearly troubled.\"\n\nThe candidate told CNN that Bosnich had been terminated from the campaign because he had been caught plagiarizing, and later broke into the campaign headquarters after being told he wasn't welcome there. DeMaio claims the San Diego Police Department is investigating the break-in, wherein Bosnich is alleged to have smashed computers and cut phone lines just days before the primary, which surely would have made phone-banking difficult during that all-important time.\n\n\"It's the classic stereotype that gay people, at the end of the day, are boiled down to nothing more than their sexual orientation, or sex, and the negative stereotype that gay individuals are sexual predators,\" Gregory T. Angelo, Executive Director of the Log Cabin Republicans, told me.\n\nIt has long been DeMaio's contention that many of the attacks against him are in their nature homophobic, and more than that, are either being lodged from, or tacitly endorsed by, those on the left side of the aisle.\n\n\"It's the classic stereotype that gay people, at the end of the day, are boiled down to nothing more than their sexual orientation, or sex, and the negative stereotype that gay individuals are sexual predators.\"\n\nDeMaio has claimed that his 2012 mayoral opponent criticized his partner \"just to point out the fact that I was gay.\" During the same campaign, a deceptively named political action committee, Conservatives for Gay Rights Supporting Carl DeMaio for Mayor 2012, paid for robocalls that not-so-subtly alerted voters to DeMaio's sexual orientation, by asking them whether or not it would make a difference to them. The same group sent out literature which featured a photoshopped image of DeMaio next to a man dressed in drag. The group heavily focused their distribution of the image to the historically religious and slow-to-warm-the-idea-of-gay-rights African American community.\n\nWithin the LGBT community, the attacks did not inspire a desire to support or protect DeMaio\u2014to the contrary, many LGBT groups were openly hostile to him, to the extent that he was booed at a gay pride parade. (The lack of love likely stems from DeMaio's silence on Proposition 8.)\n\nIt is tempting to compare DeMaio\u2019s treatment by the LGBT community to the way in which some conservative women are treated by the feminist establishment and the left in general\u2014which is to say, sexism that would be condemned if it were being rained upon Nancy Pelosi or Kirsten Gillibrand is ignored or endorsed when the target is Sarah Palin or Michele Bachmann. However, such a sympathetic interpretation of DeMaio's reception would overlook the fact that among gay Republicans currently running for Congress\u2014Dan Innis in New Hampshire and Richard Tisei in Massachusetts completing the trifecta\u2014DeMaio is the outlier who is not being welcomed with open arms by the LGBT establishment. It seems that, for the gay community, the problem is not so much gay Republicans as it is gay Republicans named Carl DeMaio.\n\nStill, as soon as DeMaio announced his bid for Congress, allegations of sexual deviancy began to fly\u2014but they seemed flimsy at best.\n\nThe Voice of OC, a \u201ca non-profit investigative news agency focusing on politics and government,\u201d reported that DeMaio had been caught masturbating in men's rooms during City Council meetings. The City Council president told the publication he had twice seen DeMaio in action, and a second member of the Council confirmed the accusation. By way of proving his innocence, DeMaio took a polygraph test\u2014and passed. The City Council president refused to do the same.\n\nIt is, perhaps, with that in mind that some are viewing the current series of charges being lobbed at the candidate.\n\n\"I just see someone that seems like they have an axe to grind and the media running with unsubstantiated claims 25 days out from a hotly contested election where a gay Republican is on the verge of making history,\" Angelo told me.\n\nIndeed, the timing of the story is incredibly poor for DeMaio, whose opponent, Peters, for his part, has stayed mum on the topic. DeMaio is currently leading him by three points.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:13.662+0000"}

But when the candidate\u2019s gay, it\u2019s a big deal.\n\nThe speaker of the House is going to California this week to raise money for Carl DeMaio, one of two openly gay GOP nominees in close races this year, despite calls from leading social conservative groups for Boehner and other prominent Republicans not to support DeMaio because of his backing of gay marriage.

The number of rebellious Republicans is bound to grow in November, as outgoing members like former majority leader Eric Cantor and longtime moderate stalwart Tom Petri are likely to be replaced by fervent conservatives who have not committed to backing Boehner for reelection. The result is that Boehner needs to pick up seats to ensure a functioning majority. After all, Republicans elected in swing districts are far less likely to be willing to risk a government shutdown than those who have safe seats.\n\nDeMaio\u2019s race on its own won\u2019t make a big difference for Boehner.

{"entityId": 1899, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "There\u2019s one man, some Republicans say, who kept the public from learning about the chemical shells littered around Iraq. He was Bush\u2019s most important political adviser.\n\nStarting in 2004, some members of the George W. Bush administration and Republican lawmakers began to find evidence of discarded chemical weapons in Iraq. But when the information was brought up with the White House, senior adviser Karl Rove told them to \u201clet these sleeping dogs lie.\u201d\n\nThe issue of Iraq\u2019s WMD remnants was suddenly thrust back into the fore this week, with a blockbuster New York Times report accusing the Bush administration of covering up American troops\u2019 chemically induced wounds.\n\nTo people familiar with the issue, both inside that administration and outside, the blame for the coverup falls on one particular set of shoulders: Rove\u2019s.\n\nFrom the perspective of Rick Santorum, a Republican senator from Pennsylvania who lost his seat in 2006, some of the weapons of mass destruction President Bush promised would be in Iraq before the 2003 invasion of the country began turning up as early as 2004.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Beast, Santorum said he and his staff began receiving photographs of discarded sarin and mustard-gas shells from U.S. soldiers in 2004. Two years later, when he was up for re-election, Santorum even went public with some of this information in a press conference disclosing a Pentagon report that found 500 chemical-weapons shells had been found in Iraq.\n\nOne might think a politically vulnerable Bush White House would\u2019ve seized on Santorum\u2019s discovery. After all, Bush and his subordinates famously accused Iraq of having active weapons of mass destruction programs.\n\nBut at least in 2005 and 2006, the Bush White House wasn\u2019t interested. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to look back,\u201d Santorum recalled Rove as saying (though Santorum stressed he was not quoting verbatim conversations he had more than eight years ago). \u201cI will say that the gist of the comments from the president\u2019s senior people was \u2018We don\u2019t want to look back, we want to look forward.\u2019\u201d\n\nDave Wurmser\u2014who served at the time as a senior adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney on national-security issues\u2014remembers receiving a similar message from Rove.\n\n\u201cIn 2005-6, Karl Rove and his team blocked public disclosure of these findings and said, \u2018Let these sleeping dogs lie; we have lost that fight so better not to remind anyone of it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to Wurmser, \u201cin 2005-6, Karl Rove and his team blocked public disclosure of these (findings) and said \u2018Let these sleeping dogs lie; we have lost that fight so better not to remind anyone of it.\u2019\u201d\n\nRove declined to comment for this story.\n\nAt least part of the Bush administration\u2019s case against Saddam Hussein was based on the fact that he never properly accounted for the chemical-weapons stockpile he had built up in the 1980s. As Santorum himself said during his 2006 press conference, the Pentagon\u2019s report at the time \u201cproves that weapons of mass destruction are, in fact, in Iraq.\u201d\n\nSantorum on Thursday stood by that claim. \u201cThere was no active chemical-weapons operation in Iraq\u2014that doesn\u2019t mean there were no chemical weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the point we were making. It\u2019s clear from The New York Times\u2019 article that the military as well as the administration didn\u2019t want to have that conversation because they missed it.\u201d\n\nSantorum said that in 2005 he began raising the issue with the White House himself. \u201cI had discussions over a period of a year or two. Why aren\u2019t we mentioning this? Why aren\u2019t we doing anything on this?\u201d he recalled. But Santorum later became so frustrated that by 2006, his message to the White House was: \u201cI am going to do this [go public] whether you do it or not.\u201d\n\nOne former senior White House official who requested anonymity confirmed that the White House had no interest in 2006 in re-engaging the public debate over weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He said that other lawmakers had recommended Bush give a press conference with some of the discarded weapons wearing a protective suit.\n\n\u201cWe killed that idea at the time,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to have the president near this stuff, it\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d This former official said that there were attempts from the White House in 2004 to get some in the media to write about the issue, but the narrative about Iraq and the weapons of mass destruction was already fixed in the mind of the public and the press. \u201cThere was not much we could do on this,\u201d this official said.\n\nNonetheless, Santorum and others continued to press the White House. In the House, Pete Hoekstra, who was then the Republican chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, conducted his own investigation into the older chemical weapons that were showing up in Iraq.\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Hoekstra declined to name Bush administration officials with whom he spoke. But he said he felt stonewalled during his own investigation in 2005 and 2006 into the issue. \u201cThis was an active investigation by the intelligence committee and they chose not to answer our questions truthfully and fully,\u201d Hoekstra said.\n\nIndeed, when Hoekstra teamed up with Santorum in 2006 to present the Pentagon finding about 500 chemical-weapons warheads, he said the Pentagon was much more critical of the information than the media or the Democrats.\n\n\u201cThey came out and said these were not the weapons we were looking for,\u201d Hoekstra said. \u201cSomewhere along the line we were talking to people who were lying to us. This has to reach fairly far and fairly high. I am absolutely furious about it.\u201d At the time, David Kay, the first head of the team of weapons inspectors in post-invasion Iraq, said the munitions publicized by Hoekstra and Santorum in 2006 were \u201cless toxic than most things that Americans have under their kitchen sink at this point.\u201d\n\nOne explanation for why the White House was not interested was so as not to tip off Sunni insurgents in Iraq. As The New York Times reported this week, some of the main areas in Iraq used to store chemical weapons are in areas now controlled by ISIS.\n\nWurmser said that in 2004 and 2005 \u201cchemical-weapons shells began turning up in arms markets in Iraq in small numbers, but eventually in batches of 100 or so.\u201d He said that when he asked the U.S. intelligence community to go public with the information, they \u201cquite properly asked it be kept quiet until they track down the source of the weapons so that they can secure it and not tip off Sunni insurgents to go and retrieve them themselves.\u201d\n\nEventually, Wurmser said, Sunni insurgent groups did gain access to the shells in 2005. \u201cThere were to my memory at least two attacks on our soldiers using chemical weapons-rigged shells as [improvised explosive devices]. Fortunately, they were ineffectively weaponized and soldiers were wounded but not killed.\u201d\n\nWurmser, however, grew more frustrated over time. \u201cAfter waiting a year\u2014during which we asked that the source of the batches be traced and followed to the location where the shells were being retrieved\u2014we continued to see the trickle, but then discovered nobody was making any effort to track the source to the location of retrieval,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we were continuing to try to buy up some of the stuff in the market.\u201d\n\nAfter the U.S. found thousands of the old chemical-weapons shells, Wurmser and others at one point argued that they had an obligation to declare the stocks of chemical weapons under the Chemical Weapons Convention and destroy them. The United States was, after all, the occupier of Iraq and had assumed the country\u2019s sovereign responsibilities as a signatory to the convention.\n\n\u201cIt was all for nothing; Rove wanted the issue buried,\u201d Wurmser said.\n\nAt the end of the day, Santorum said he would not call the White House behavior at the time a coverup, as was implied in The New York Times story. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would use the term coverup,\u201d he said. \u201cI would just say they simply didn\u2019t want to discuss it.\u201d\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:14.418+0000"}

Allegedly whistling at a white woman.\n\nThis weekend marks the 60th anniversary of the tragic murder of Emmett Till. There will be commemorative events honoring the life of the young teen in Chicago and Mississippi. And that\u2019s because, according to Chris Benson, associate professor of African American studies and journalism at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Till\u2019s death still resonates today.\n\n\u201cThe reason we are so captivated by the lynching of Emmett Till 60 years later is that it\u2019s justice that has not been reached. It grates against our sense of justice in America that this horrible event has never been resolved,\u201d says Benson, who co-authored the book, Death of Innocence with Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Mobley. \u201cWe see so many similar cases coming up in the contemporary moment that remind us of the injustice in the Emmett Till case. When we see the case of Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown or Tamir Rice, where young Black males are shot down by authority figures and nobody\u2019s punished, it reminds us of the most celebrated case where a Black teen was killed and nobody was brought to justice.\u201d\n\nAP\n\nHistory notes that Till was with a group of teenagers who had stopped at a local grocery store to buy snacks when he broke Mississippi\u2019s racial code of conduct. Just a year earlier, the U.S. Supreme Court had announced separate but equal schools were unconstitutional in the historic Brown v. Board of education case. But things were still done a little differently in Mississippi. The state fought against any interruption in its system of segregation and often resorted to violence.\n\nSo it was in this space that four days after his alleged \u201ccrime,\u201d Till was kidnapped in the wee hours of the morning on August 28, 1955 by two white men, Roy Bryant, husband of Carolyn Bryant, the store clerk Till allegedly whistled at, and J.W. Milam.\n\nBryant and Milan tortured Till for hours. He was brutally beaten. Barbed wire tied around his neck. He was shot in the head. The young teen was weighted with a cotton gin fan and thrown in the Tallatchie River. Three days later, Till\u2019s bloated body surfaced, his face severely disfigured. He was identified by a ring on his finger, one his mother had given him that had his father\u2019s initials.\n\nWhen Till\u2019s body arrived in Chicago, Mamie Till Mobley couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. She wanted to show the world what Mississippi had done to her son, her only child. Mobley demanded an open-casket at Till\u2019s funeral. His mutilated body was on display for five days as more than 100,000 folks lined the streets of Chicago to get a glimpse of what hate could do. The graphic images were published in Jet magazine and Black newspapers. Her decision changed the course of history.\n\n\u201cOpening that casket and allowing Emmett Till\u2019s body to lay in state allowed people to witness the horrible face of race hatred,\u201d said Benson. \u201cIt horrified people to the extent that they had never seen anything like this and to imagine that our children could be subjected to such horrors really moved people. So opening the casket opened our eyes to the injustice in this country and the consequences of that continued injustice if we didn\u2019t do something about it.\u201d\n\nBut justice would never come.\n\nIt took just little more than an hour for an all-white male jury to acquit Bryant and Milam of the murder of Emmett Till. Months later, Look magazine paid Bryant and Milam $4,000 so they would reveal how they killed the Chicago teen.\n\nThe fact that two white men were not convicted of murdering a young Black boy was not surprising in 1955 Mississippi. But what was surprising was the bravery and courage of Till\u2019s uncle Mose Wright, who stood up during the trial and pointed to Bryant and Milam as the men who had kidnapped Till. It was nearly unheard of for a Black man to oppose a white man in court. In doing so, Wright put his own life in danger and immediately left Mississippi soon after.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the context in the South at that time, for him to do that was nothing short of courageous,\u201d says Paula Johnson, law professor and co-director of the Cold Case Justice Initiative at Syracuse University. The initiative investigates racially-motivated murders that occurred during the civil rights era.\n\n\u201cAs we talk about Black Lives Matter, this is what Mamie Till Mobley was saying to us\u2014\u2018My son\u2019s life matters.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwo months after Milam and Bryant were acquitted for the murder of Emmett Till, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus, sparking the 381-day Montgomery bus boycott and the beginning of a Civil Rights Movement led by a young minister by the name of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The fight for civil rights, which had mostly been a legal strategy up until that time, had become a mass movement. Soon after there were Freedom Rides, sit-ins at lunch counters, boycotts, demonstrations, and marches. And all of this can be traced back to Emmett Till.\n\n\u201cAs we talk about Black Lives Matter, this is what Mamie Till Mobley was saying to us\u2014\u2018My son\u2019s life matters,\u2019\u201d says Johnson. \u201cTill was not the first lynching but it was a defining moment in so many ways. Emmett Till\u2019s murder galvanized an activist movement of that which continues today.\u201d\n\nIndeed, during the Movement for Black Lives conference in Cleveland this summer, activists of the Black Lives Matter movement honored the families of civil rights martyrs. The first image was of Emmett Till.\n\nAirickca Gordon-Taylor, cousin of Emmett Till and president of the Mamie Till Mobley Memorial Foundation, spoke at the Movement for Black Lives conference. She says Till kicked off the Black Lives Matter movement and noted that he was \u201ca sacrificial lamb.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many parallels today to what happened in 1955 and if we\u2019re not careful all of our rights will be stripped away again,\u201d Gordon-Taylor told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe have to be very diligent and very mindful and we have to come together as a community to work towards putting people in positions and roles that have our best interests at heart to work toward changing these policies.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department re-opened Till\u2019s case in 2004. His body was exhumed and an autopsy was conducted but it was closed three years later due to the statute of limitations and insufficient evidence. But though no one was ever convicted for the murder of Emmett Till, his name will be forever associated with the fight for justice and civil rights. His life will not be forgotten. In fact, there are several movies being made about Emmett Till. A film based on Benson\u2019s book will begin production next year, and it was recently announced that Jay-Z and Will Smith will produce a movie about Till for HBO.\n\n\u201cIn so many ways, the case of Emmett Till was the first Black Lives Matter case,\u201d says Benson. \u201cEmmett Till is certainly a story about racial injustice. It\u2019s a story about white supremacy. But within those elements is a recognition that this is really a story about power. Emmett Till was killed as an expression of power\u2014power over the black body. We have to ask: What might had he been if he had lived?\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:15.157+0000"}

The fact is that whether it\u2019s Jeb, or Hillary, or any of \u2019em\u2014they\u2019re all controlled by these people! And the people that control them are the special interests, the lobbyists and the donors.\u201d\n\nHe smiled slightly.\n\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s nice about me?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s money.\u201d\n\nIn practice, however, the candidate seems willing to associate himself with just about anyone offering support\u2014even if that support comes in the form of everything he hates rolled into one: a super PAC run by lobbyists.\n\nOn July 1, a pro-Trump super PAC, Make America Great Again PAC, filed with the FEC.\n\nThe organization listed on its paperwork a New York City address, which Bloomberg traced to a Midtown FedEx store. The address the PAC provided for supporters to mail their checks to was a Midtown UPS store. Calls to the group\u2019s listed phone number went unanswered, as did an email. The treasurer who submitted the form to the FEC signed it \u201cLes Caldwell,\u201d short for Leslie, and Leslie refused to comment on the record to Politico, while just about every Leslie Caldwell listed in New York chose not to answer or return any of my calls.\n\nCuriously, a closer look at the group\u2019s filing reveals a return address not in New York City but in Colorado.\n\nThat address belongs to Jon Anderson, a lobbyist whose \u201cpractice is focused on corporate compliance and representing clients before federal, state and local government,\u201d according to the website of his firm, Holland & Hart.\n\nA consultant for the PAC, Mike Ciletti, also from Colorado, is also a lobbyist. He has his own group, New West Public Affairs, which he co-founded in 2009, according to his LinkedIn profile. His clients include the Community Financial Services Association, the trade association for payday lenders, which are often accused of predatory lending.\n\nAnderson didn\u2019t return a call, and Ciletti responded to interview requests with frustration that his activity with the PAC had placed him in the spotlight. \u201cPersonally I am waiting to see what other email addresses, phone numbers you can find to try to reach me at. Hats off to you,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cI am not interested in going on the record at this point, perhaps in the future. The focus should be on the candidates.\u201d\n\nAt first glance, Make America Great Again PAC seems like it could be a so-called scam PAC, or a fake political operation intended to do nothing more than help its founders get rich. Scam PACs have been cropping up since the rise of the Tea Party. A Politico investigation in January found that of the $43 million that 33 PACs together raised in the 2014 election cycle, only $3 million was spent on candidates. The rest, well\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not using the lobbyists. I\u2019m not using donors. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m really rich.\u201d\n\nBut Trump seemed to quash those concerns when in mid-July he attended a 200-person fundraiser organized by Make America Great Again PAC at a private home in Manhattan. \u201cIt was a combination of friends that have known Mr. Trump for years while others were meeting with him for the first time,\u201d press-shy Ciletti told the press.\n\nMake America Great Again PAC is one of four PACs supporting Trump\u2019s candidacy, though it is the only one to receive his endorsement in the form of a fundraiser appearance.\n\nIt might even be said that, when you really assess the pillars of Trump\u2019s campaign platform, he might be known as the Buddy Roemer of 2016\u2014if Trump weren\u2019t so bombastic and intent on incessant racial insensitivity.\n\nTo the extent that he is selling a political philosophy, it\u2019s this: \u201cI\u2019m really rich.\u201d He\u2019s not just bragging when he says that. What he means is that the system is so broken that anyone who is not really rich is at the mercy of their financial backers. \u201cI\u2019m really rich\u201d is Trump\u2019s way of saying he is, by virtue of his terrific wealth, incorruptible.\n\nTrump is a cynic. In his view, the only way to fix the broken process by which candidates are elected using massive sums of money funneled to them by shadow organizations and power-hungry billionaires looking to get favors in return is to evade the process altogether by supporting someone like him\u2014someone with the capacity to be their own biggest donor, and thus to answer to no one but themselves.\n\nIn his June 16 announcement speech, Trump mentioned lobbyists six times.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will never make America great again. They don\u2019t even have a chance. They\u2019re controlled fully\u2014they\u2019re controlled fully by the lobbyists, and by the special interests, fully.\u201d\n\nFord Motor, Trump complained, was going to build a $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico, and if anyone besides him were president, they couldn\u2019t do a thing to stop it. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, \u2018You can\u2019t do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can\u2019t do that to Ford.\u2019\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, of course, could do whatever he pleased to Ford. \u201cI\u2019m using my own money,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not using the lobbyists. I\u2019m not using donors. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m really rich.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:15.436+0000"}
{"entityId": 1902, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "In one breath, the New Jersey governor gives credibility to one of the drug war\u2019s enduring myths, and in the next, he calls the whole thing an \u2018abject failure.\u2019\n\nThe 43rd anniversary of President Richard Nixon\u2019s War on Drugs was a confusing time for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who has been on a subtle-but-consistent campaign to position himself as a leader, stationed on the front lines, of reforming drug policy in America.\n\nIn one breath, he gave credibility to one of the drug war\u2019s enduring myths, and in the next, he called it an \u201cabject failure.\u201d And Christie\u2019s incoherence on the issue seems emblematic of the right-wing dilemma at hand: reforming drug policy is seemingly inevitable, and interwoven with prison reform--an issue conservatives are owning. But it\u2019s still too far out an idea to expect the whole party to fall in line.\n\nOn Tuesday, Christie paid a visit to a shelter in Trenton to unveil an initiative which will allow law enforcement across the state to carry naloxone, a drug capable of reversing the symptoms of a heroin or opiate overdose. The gov\u2019s announcement came after a pilot program launched in April proved a success, preventing over 40 overdoses in Monmouth and Ocean counties, according to officials.\n\n\u201cWe have the ability to prevent this type of tragedy and help save lives,\u201d Christie said, before riffing on the general \u201cfailure\u201d of the War on Drugs. But less than 24 hours earlier, Christie delivered a message about the Garden State\u2019s collapsing medical marijuana program that could be interpreted as an endorsement of the War on Drugs.\n\nOn Monday evening, Christie appeared on his monthly radio program. Seated in front of the mic, headphones engulfing his head and reading glasses resting professorially on the tip of nose, he addressed criticism of his medical marijuana program, which is suffering from a debilitatingly low participation rate that some say is due to high costs and too much red tape.\n\n\u201cWhat there is a huge demand for is marijuana, not medical marijuana,\u201d Christie snapped, his arms folded defensively. \u201cThis program and all these other programs are, in my mind, a front for legalization\u2014unless you have a strong governor and a strong administration that says, \u2018Oh, medical marijuana? Absolutely, we\u2019re going to make it a medically-based program.\u2019\u201d His tone turned sarcastic and his eyebrows raised. \u201cNo demand there\u2014very little.\u201d\n\nOn his final day in office, departing Democratic Governor Jon Corzine signed New Jersey\u2019s medical marijuana bill (The Compassionate Care Act) into law. The move, qualifying those with certain debilitating conditions to apply for a medical marijuana license, was cut up by Christie, who said the bill \u201cpassed with no type of allowances for that type of safety and security,\u201d and was \u201cdumped in our laps at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d\n\nTo safeguard his constituents from the half-baked legislation, Christie drew up a dispensary-approval process so strict that three years later, only one had overcome the economic and legal hurdles necessary to open. Today, there are just five. And with only 296 of New Jersey\u2019s 21,000 licensed physicians able to write prescriptions, the meager 2,500 patients that make up the market have left it on the verge of collapse.\n\nJust last week, the CEO of the only medical-marijuana dispensary in South Jersey, Bill Thomas, quit, claiming that three years of work in the failing industry felt like charity. The Compassionate Care Foundation, which Thomas opened in October 2013, is serving only 600 patients\u2014less than half of the 2,000 it needed to just break even.\n\nAccording to Thomas, the issue is not the lack of demand for medical marijuana, but the lack of doctors with the power to prescribe it to their patients. \u201cIs there really no demand, or is it so hard to get access that it is easier to buy it from the high school kid down the street?\u201d Thomas asked the Star-Ledger.\n\nChristie administration officials themselves reportedly modeled the program after New Mexico\u2019s\u2014but one key difference is that in New Mexico, the names of doctors are not disclosed on the program\u2019s website as they are in New Jersey. Democratic Assemblyman Reed Gusciora (who Christie once famously referred to as \u201cnumb nuts\u201d) claims the public listing of the doctors\u2019 names deters some from becoming involved with the program.\n\n\"What there is a huge demand for is marijuana, not medical marijuana. This program and all these other programs are, in my mind, a front for legalization.\u201d\n\nReached for comment, a spokesman for Christie, Michael Drewniak, said the governor\u2019s critics \u201care wrong. The program is medically based, not permissive as in states like Colorado that are experiencing the consequences of legalization. Appropriate restrictions in New Jersey's medically based program explains the limited enrollment versus the tens of thousands predicted\u2014hoped for\u2014by 'advocates' who were really counting on legalization and the profits that would come from legalization. We're not doing that.\u201d\n\nStill, Christie\u2019s comment that there is \u201ca huge demand for marijuana, not medical marijuana,\u201d is made even more eyebrow-raising in light of recent stories concerning cannabis as an effective treatment for severe epilepsy in kids.\n\nIt was that very treatment that the mother of a 15-month-old named Sabina Joana was fighting to get for her daughter, who suffered from Dravet syndrome (a rare form of epilepsy that can be treated with cannabis), before she was taken off life support at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, the town where Christie grew up.\n\nThe Joanas spent months trying to find a doctor who could prescribe \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d\u2014CBD oil, a non-psychoactive ingredient in pot that has been successful at stopping seizures. The specific strain was not available in New Jersey, and Sabina succumbed to her illness before her family could move to Colorado to get it for her.\n\nPaula criticized the Christie administration\u2019s handling of the medical marijuana program in an Op-Ed for the Ledger, writing, \u201cMy daughter died on their watch...Political agendas kill people. It killed my daughter.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing the story at a town hall in April, Christie told Joana he was \u201chorribly sorry,\u201d adding that he would consider forcing dispensaries to carry Charlotte\u2019s Web.\n\nStudies have repeatedly shown that marijuana is beneficial for a variety of medical conditions. In what is considered a seminal study on the issue, conducted by researchers from the University of California Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research, marijuana was proven to be a \u201cfirst line treatment\u201d for neuropathic pain.\n\nOther studies have concluded that cannabis can \u201cexert palliative effects\u201d on cancer patients, preventing nasuea, vomiting, and pain, stimulating appetites, and that it can improve the quality of life for those living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, an estimated 2.5 million Americans were registered with medical marijuana identification cards in 2011. Since then, the number of states where medical cannabis is legal has almost doubled. With a surge in medical marijuana use across the nation has come overwhelming public support\u201458 percent of Americans now favor legalization.\n\nThe momentum has even extended to Congress, where the first major medical marijuana reform bill passed just weeks ago.\n\nChristie was publicly calling the War on Drugs a failure as early as 2012, when he said in a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, \u201cWe\u2019re warehousing addicted people every day in New Jersey, giving them no treatment.\u201d During the speech, Christie used a line he would recycle again and again as drug policy and prison reform gained momentum among mainstream conservatives: \u201cIf you\u2019re pro-life, as I am, you can\u2019t be pro-life just in the womb.\u201d\n\nChristie used a variation of that very line at CPAC this year, where the sentiment was echoed by Texas Governor Rick Perry, who favors marijuana decriminalization as part of the Lone Star State\u2019s progressive prison reform policy.\n\nOn Tuesday, 30 members of Congress called on the Obama administration to remove obstacles to marijuana research in a bipartisan letter sent to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe Drug War has resulted in the incarceration of 2.2 million Americans, a number that made up more than 50 percent of the federal inmate population in America in 2010. Grover Norquist, founder of Americans for Tax Reform, told The Daily Beast that while prison reform is on its way to becoming a consensus issue for conservatives by the time the GOP caucuses roll around, medical marijuana legalization becoming part of the right-wing platform is a ways off.\n\nNorquist told The Daily Beast that many conservatives still agree with Christie\u2019s Monday night comments, and that other things--like lowering mandatory minimums and focusing on parole and probation instead of jail time--are an easier sell at the present moment. \u201cI think you probably have to have a few more years of a few more states [legalizing medical marijuana] under the belt before more conservatives would feel comfortable [supporting it].\u201d\n\nChristie has noted the basic economic common sense of choosing rehabilitation over incarceration: \u201cIt costs $49,000 a year to warehouse a prisoner in New Jersey state prisons. A full year of inpatient drug treatment costs just $24,000.\u201d\n\nIn June 2012, Christie signed into a law a bill which expanded the Garden State\u2019s drug court program, requiring nonviolent offenders to enter treatment, as part of a pilot program. Participants in the program must take part in court-prescribed treatments and submit to regular drug testing--and failing a drug test could result in jail time. Christie reportedly wanted the progressive program implemented statewide, and it was Democrats standing in the way with cost concerns.\n\nBut some contend that Christie looks less like an opponent of the War on Drugs than he does an active participant.\n\nKen Wolski, the executive director of the Coalition for Medical Marijuana in New Jersey, told The Daily Beast, \u201cOf course, it is the threat of prison that ensures marijuana offenders\u2014even medical marijuana users\u2014attend these treatment programs, so really Christie continues to wage the War on Drugs while recognizing it as a failure and enriching his friends in the [pharmacuetical] industry.\u201d\n\nYet Christie seems to believe it\u2019s possible to decry the War on Drugs while taking baby steps toward vague reform. Drewniak told The Daily Beast that many advocates are \u201clooking for something far beyond a medical marijuana program,\u201d something which is \u201cnot going to happen in New Jersey during this administration. In fact, the law we\u2019ve implemented\u2014signed by the prior governor\u2014did not anticipate or endorse legalization.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cwar on drugs\u201d as we know it today began in 1961 when Congress began allotting President Richard Nixon what would amount to $371 million to fight the rise of drug addiction in America\u2014which he claimed had become a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d Nixon used the money to launch several massive drug-fighting initiatives, one of which included significantly augmenting federal drug control agencies and passing new measures like mandatory sentencing and no-knock warrants (both of which are still used today). After signing the official piece of legislation in January 1962, Nixon officially declared war. \u201cI am convinced that the only way to fight this menace is by attacking it on many fronts,\u201d he said in a letter to Congress.\n\nToday, the term applies to the residual effects of Nixon\u2019s war\u2014namely, the fierce prohibition and criminalization of drugs in America. Beyond harsh sentencing and federal crackdowns, the war included placing many drugs on a \"Schedule I Substance\u201d list. The classification\u2014which includes heroin, cocaine, and marijuana\u2014represents the most restrictive class of illicit drugs in America, so-classified based on a perceived lack of medical benefit and high risk of addiction.\n\nMarijuana\u2019s role in the war on drugs is considered by many to be the ultimate example of the drug war\u2019s failure. In 1970, Nixon temporarily placed it on the schedule I list, pending a review from a congressional commission. Following a thorough examination of the drug\u2019s effects in 1972, every single member of the commission voted in favor of decriminalizing the possession and distribution of marijuana for personal use. Nixon ignored the recommendation, solidifying marijuana\u2019s classification as one of the deadliest drugs in America. Attempts by individual states to decriminalize it in the five years following were squandered as teen marijuana use began to rise.\n\nDespite innumerable studies on the medical benefits of marijuana, it remains classified as a schedule I substance, a distinction which makes it nearly impossible to obtain for medical research (since it\u2019s classification allegedly proves it to have no medical benefit). It\u2019s a problem that, in turn, makes obtaining it for medical benefit, even in state\u2019s where individual laws have been passed, extremely difficult. The criminalization of marijuana, which Christie himself has now backed, is a direct result of Nixon\u2019s drug-fighting initiatives. The stigma surrounding its use is arguably one of the most harmful byproducts of the war on drugs.\n\nIn other words, Christie\u2019s alleged distaste for the war on drugs is sabotaged by his own subliminal support of it. His view that \u201cmedical marijuana\u201d is a \u201cfront for legalization\u201d endorses the very foundation on which the drug war rests: they are evil and void of medical benefit. His insistence that marijuana remain on the schedule I substance list alongside the most dangerous and addictive drugs in the world not only validates Nixon's criminalization of the drug, it promotes it.\n\nCalling the $1 trillion war on drugs a failure while defending the battle from which it was born is hypocrisy at its finest. An accurate condemnation of the war on drugs would require Christie to target a particularly loud foot soldier: himself.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:15.928+0000"}

The theory at the heart of Todd\u2019s 528-page doorstopper is that Obama\u2019s obsession with his status as an outsider, as an agent of change, and his inability to backslap in Washington, are what stood in the way of Obama being a successful president.\n\nThe problem with the book is two-fold. The first is that it is largely a rehash of much of what we already know, or think we know, about the Obama White House. Books by Bob Woodward, John Heilemann, Mark Halperin, David Remnick, Timothy Geithner, Robert Gates, Leon Panetta, and reporting by Ryan Lizza, Peter Baker, Helene Cooper, and Glenn Thrush, among others, have already familiarized us with the charges of an isolated, controlling White House thwarted by the chaos of Washington.\n\nTodd, whose morning show was the most watchable and informative on cable news, has been portrayed in the press as more than your average pundit or television host. He is seen as having an unassailable knowledge of the intricacies of how Washington works\u2014the motives, opinions, and gossip from members of Congress, lobbyists, influencers, and other journalists.\n\nIf that is the case, his book is at best a disappointment. At almost every turn, he fails to move our understanding of this president beyond pop-psychology interpretations of his relationship to his mother, his childhood, and his time at the Harvard Law Review\u2014territory well explored by the president himself and in books like David Remnick\u2019s The Bridge.\n\nAt its worst, The Stranger merely recycles the biases, conventional wisdom, and cynical bitterness of inside-the-beltway habitu\u00e9s.\n\nAnd weirdly, this very opinionated book lacks the one opinion that matters most: Todd rarely says what Obama could have done differently, or what specifically would have changed as a result.\n\nFor example, to persuade us that Obama\u2019s inability to \u201cfake\u201d politics hurts him, Todd recounts how Obama, on the advice of an advisor, hosts a series of dinners for GOP senators after his 2012 reelection. Those dinners\u2014so beloved by the bipartisan-drinking-solves-everything caucus\u2014were \u201cnot nearly as rewarding for these senators as [they] could have been. While all who attended acknowledged the president was serious about reaching out and about figuring out how to do something big, the follow-through wasn\u2019t there.\u201d And while Todd notes that after the dinners \u201ca few senators even softened their anger toward the president,\u201d he doesn\u2019t explain what the Republicans wanted the president to follow through on. More dinners? Tax reform? Vegetables from the White House garden? What specifically did Obama stand to gain if he did what Todd thinks he should do? Later, after another round of similar dinners in 2013 in which Obama did manage to establish \u201ccloser relationships,\u201d Todd resolutely sticks to his glass-half-empty point that \u201cso far none have resulted in significant legislative achievement.\u201d\n\nThose details of what Obama stood to gain\u2014the stuff that would have prevented the so-called failings of his presidency\u2014present the second problem in Todd\u2019s book.\n\nAt its worst, The Stranger merely recycles the biases, conventional wisdom, and cynical bitterness of inside-the-beltway habitu\u00e9s.\n\n\n\nTime and again, the author confuses chattering class dissatisfaction with an honest assessment of accomplishment. One can think (as many do) that Obamacare, Dodd-Frank and the CFPB, DADT repeal, fuel emission standards, $800 billion stimulus, sunsetting some Bush tax cuts, dropping defense of DOMA, the auto bailout, Lily Ledbetter, student loan reform, the START treaty, and Race to the Top are all bad policy\u2014but they are achievements. In addition, Obama not only passed them, but managed to win reelection, something Jimmy Carter (a frequent comparison Todd makes) failed to do. Yes, there were other significant items on the liberal agenda, but when stacked up against the landmarks of that skilled schmoozer and frenemy specialist Bill Clinton, the diagnosis of Obama\u2019s flaws looks overblown.\n\nYou can\u2019t be fairly tagged as an ineffectual president who isn\u2019t \u201cfluent\u201d in Washington if the other side is screaming bloody murder about your agenda being shoved down their throats.\n\nThe book also manages to engender a feeling of damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don\u2019t even among those of us sympathetic to arguments that this administration has had serious shortcomings. Obama\u2019s attempt at getting buy-ins from Congress during the health-care reform process, once seen as a smart lesson learned from the Clinton debacle, ends up being faulted as the reason the bill took so long to pass. And that delay mattered almost more than anything, since it gave Republicans the time they needed to muddy the issue in the public\u2019s eyes.\n\nTodd is at his best discussing the unbelievably botched rollout of healthcare.gov. He notes early on that if former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle had been confirmed as HHS secretary, and had not withdrawn due to a tax dustup, there might not have been the disastrous vacuum of leadership at the new White House Office of Health Reform. Laid out in clear, simple prose, Todd\u2019s digestible chronology of the website\u2019s troubles leaves no doubt about the lack of White House leadership when it came to implementing its core legislative achievement.\n\nTodd is also onto something when he writes about how Obama has broken his promise to be an agent of change\u2014as when his 2008 campaign staffers woke up after Election Day to find that their bosses were old Clinton hands or how the president wound up protecting Gitmo and the national security state after he\u2019d vowed on the campaign trail to dismantle them.\n\nUnfortunately, Todd\u2019s pop-psych explanation\u2014that Obama sees himself alone as enough change\u2014is unconvincing. The problem, of course, is that when detailing how Obama does play the game and co-opts traditional Washington, Todd undercuts his own argument that Obama is above it all and too removed or na\u00efve to see how the city works.\n\nIt is unclear why Todd, now perched on the throne that Meet the Press provides, would write a book this long about so much we already know. That the book is full of conventional wisdom, of course, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong\u2014it just means it isn\u2019t very interesting.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:16.105+0000"}

But today more than ever, some believe that as long as something goes viral, gets re-tweets and \u201cstarts a conversation,\u201d it has accomplished something significant and made a difference.\n\nI was reminded how untrue this is by a new gun safety ad from the organization Evolve that has gone viral and inspired a lot of laughter, winks, and figurative high-fives from the left. What the ad is unlikely to inspire, however, is any meaningful attention from the audience that actually matters.\n\nThe PSA, which you can watch here, features two young boys playing with adult sex toys. The narration eventually says, \u201cIf they find it, they\u2019ll play with it. So always lock up your gun.\u201d\n\nBased on this language it stands to reason that the target audience for this PSA would be those who actually own guns. Gallup\u2019s 2012 analysis of five years\u2019 worth of interviews with more than 6,000 Americans provide some of the most comprehensive insight into our country\u2019s gun owners ever conducted. The analysis found that gun ownership is significantly higher among those who identify as politically conservative than those who identify as politically liberal. Other significant indicators for owning a gun: being male, being Southern, and being married. Being Southern and conservative are not adjectives that describe someone likely to find dildo humor funny.\n\nA sampling of comments on various news sites makes the political divide surrounding this ad painfully clear. The progressive program Young Turks hailed the ad as \u201cawesome\u201d and \u201cmarketing genius.\u201d But on the Huffington Post one commenter wrote,\n\n\n\n\u201cLiberals...not happy unless they\u2019re being crude and tasteless. You must be very proud.\u201d Another replied, \u201cAs a liberal I am very proud that these kids aren\u2019t dead because some idiot didn\u2019t keep their guns away from curious children. I\u2019d rather have crude and tastelss [sic] adds [sic] than another funeral because some kid pulled a trigger to gun without realizing what would happen.\u201d\n\nThese commenters are representative of a nationwide ideological divide. An Alabama obscenity law passed in 1998 made the sale of most sex toys illegal in the state. Despite multiple lawsuits seeking to overturn the ban, the law currently stands, though some have found creative ways to manage to access adult devices in the state, nonetheless. Until 2008 the sale of sex toys remained illegal in Texas until the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the law unconstitutional, following a lawsuit by the Texas-based owner of an adult film store that also sells sexual aids.\n\nOther significant indicators for owning a gun: being male, being Southern, and being married. Being Southern and conservative are not adjectives that describe someone likely to find dildo humor funny.\n\nWhile some may find these laws silly, plenty of people in these states do not. For religious and moral reasons they don\u2019t view sex toys as a laughing matter or something they want to see when they turn on their television or see a PSA pop up on their computer screen. Others are well within their rights to think these people are sexually prudish and wrong, and to hope for a healthy debate on obscenity laws. But the debate over the role of sexuality in our culture is a far different one from the debate over gun safety. For many of us the latter debate is far more important than the former.\n\nWhich is why it is such a shame that in exchange for \u201cbuzz,\u201d gun-safety proponents sacrificed something much more valuable: the ability to share an incredibly important message with people who really need to hear it; the message that gun safety matters and can save lives-\u2013particularly the lives of children.\n\nIt\u2019s too bad that much of their target audience will be too put off by the execution of the message to appreciate the substance of the message itself. And it\u2019s too bad that because of that lives that could have been saved may not be.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:17.376+0000"}

So she\u2019s toughing it out for now.\n\nThere\u2019s a phrase judges use in an opinion that any lawyer instantly recognizes as a sure sign the case is lost; it\u2019s when the court praises \u201ccounsel\u2019s commendable candor.\u201d That\u2019s legalese for saying the lawyer admitted he\u2019s got a losing argument.\n\nToday, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg committed a different kind of commendable candor; one rarely if ever issued from the solemn halls of the Supreme Court.\n\nGinsburg\u2019s moment of candor came when she was finally asked face to face by Elle Magazine the question many Court watchers and anxious liberals have been wondering for a couple of years now\u2014why she wasn\u2019t planning on stepping down soon so that a Democratic president could nominate her successor.\n\nThe 81-year-old Ginsburg, a cancer survivor, said: \u201cWho do you think President Obama could appoint at this very day, given the boundaries that we have? If I resign any time this year, he could not successfully appoint anyone I would like to see in the court. Anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they\u2019re misguided.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the substance of what she said that\u2019s so surprising; it\u2019s highly unlikely that, with 60 votes needed to confirm a nominee, Obama would have any chance of success whether the GOP has 48 senators or 52 (I made the same argument in a recent Beast column).\n\nNo, what\u2019s surprising is that Justice Ginsburg openly acknowledged the political calculations that are governing her decisions. This is something justices are just not supposed to do, no matter how obvious it is that everything from their appointments to their decisions to their behavior are often inextricably entwined with politics. Those black robes, those marble halls and columns, those lifetime appointments, are all supposed to suggest a magisterial ascension from the grubby business of vote-gathering to the rarified atmosphere of high-minded decision-making.\n\nThat\u2019s why \u201cjudicious\u201d means what it does. That\u2019s also why, when Justice John Paul Stevens told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that \u201cyou have to have an interest in who is going to fill your shoes,\u201d he said it four years after he resigned from the Court. That\u2019s also why justices\u2019 political hopes and fears are best expressed privately, as Sandra Day O\u2019Connor did on Election Night 2000, when Florida was originally called for Gore.\n\n\u201dThis is terrible,\u201d Newsweek quoted her as saying; she\u2019d been hoping to step down, but was not eager to let a President Gore name her successor. (In the event, Bush became president, and O\u2019Connor did not resign until 2006\u2014and later expressed her unhappiness with the Court\u2019s decision, in which she joined, that put Bush in the White House.)\n\n\u201cAnybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they\u2019re misguided.\u201d\n\nThere was a time, not that long ago, when many Supreme Court justices were drawn from the ranks of politicians: William Howard Taft, Hugo Black, James Byrnes, Earl Warren, and Sandra Day O\u2019Connor all held elective office, while others--Byron White, Arthur Goldberg, William Rehnquist\u2014all held high-ranking political posts in presidential administrations. The current Court, though, is full not of pols but of judges; only Elena Kagan lacks prior experience as a federal judge.\n\nOnce put on the Court, of course, justices are supposed to cease anything approaching political activity, sometimes to their discontent (Arthur Goldberg once lamented, \u201cwhen I was Secretary of Labor, my phone never stopped ringing; now it never rings.\u201d) In a few cases, however, justices kept up a \u201cpolitical life\u201d of one sort or another.\n\nJustice Charles Evans Hughes did not campaign for the 1916 Republican presidential nomination, but he indicated his willingness to accept it; he won it, and lost narrowly to President Wilson. In 1931, he went back to the Court as Chief Justice. Felix Frankfurter, a key New Deal adviser to Franklin Roosevelt, never stopped peppering FDR with advice after he joined the Court in 1938, advice Roosevelt rarely took. And William O. Douglas never stopped trying to achieve his lifelong ambition: the presidency of the United States. He came close: In 1944, FDR named him and Harry Truman as acceptable running mates. Roosevelt died just three months into his term.\n\nNo justice, however, was the equal of Abe Fortas in keeping one foot\u2014make that one and a half feet\u2014in the political arena. A longtime confidant of and lawyer for Lyndon Johnson, Fortas remained a close advisor after joining the Court. He attended White House strategy sessions on Vietnam and Israel; a private phone line linked his court office to the Oval Office. It was an open secret, and one that discomfited several of his brethren.\n\nThere are less obvious political ties to the Court: Presidents sometimes want advice from sitting justices about future nominations\u2014and the justices seem more than willing to provide it. In 1962, President Kennedy was looking to name Court of Appeals Judge William Hastie as the first black justice. But Chief Justice Earl Warren objected: \"He's not a liberal and he'll be opposed to all measures we are interested in, and he would be completely unsatisfactory,\u201d Warren told the White House. Byron White, an ex-college football star who worked in Bobby Kennedy\u2019s Justice Department, was chosen instead.\n\nSo what accounts for Ginsburg\u2019s openness? In part, it may stem from what looks like an increasingly \u201cpolitical\u201d Court. There was a time when justices often voted in ways that infuriated the presidents who appointed them and the parties from which they sprung. The politically liberal Frankfurter became the liberals\u2019 bete noire as an apostle of \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d; Democrat Tom Clark, nominated by Harry Truman, was highly skeptical of civil liberties claims; Eisenhower appointees Earl Warren and William Brennan became reliable liberals, as did Nixon appointee William Blackmun and George H.W. Bush choice David Souter.\n\nBut Souter, named to the Court in 1990, is the last such example. Partly in response to his \u201capostasy,\u201d presidents have become much more careful about picking judges who by and large will follow a predictable political path. On the Court bench today, only Anthony Kennedy holds the unofficial title of \u201cswing vote,\u201d and only on a few issues, such as gay rights. And Kennedy has been on the bench since 1988.\n\nSo maybe Justice Ginsburg was simply responding to a new reality. If the pretense of \u201cnon-political\u201d Court is now just about universally scorned, why not recognize the elephant\u2014or donkey\u2014in the room?", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:17.600+0000"}

Bush as CNN\u2019s White House correspondent from 2006 to 2011.\n\nIt was Henry\u2014after being warned never to shout at Bush, who preferred to call on reporters from a list of pre-selected names\u2014who went ahead and shouted anyway at his first Rose Garden news conference, asking about the employment future of beleaguered Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and eliciting Bush\u2019s famous phrase, \u201cI\u2019m the decider.\u201d\n\nFormer Bush White House Press Secretary Dana Perino, now a regular on Fox News\u2019s The Five, recalls that Henry\u2019s pointed questioning in the briefing room frequently made her scowl\u2014a sour expression captured in photographs\u2014while she affectionately refers to him as \u201ca stone in my shoe.\u201d\n\nFormer CNN-U.S. president Jonathan Klein, who was Henry\u2019s boss, calls him \u201ca real old-style reporter who shows no fear or favor\u2014and it can be annoying to the target...He\u2019s just an aggressive son of a bitch when it comes to confronting politicians\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what you want in your reporters.\u201d\n\nHenry has clearly been sharpening his son-of-a-bitchiness while he doubles as the Fox News reporter assigned to chase candidate Clinton to Iowa, New Hampshire and beyond.\n\n\u201cI think \u2018Did you wipe the server?\u2019 is a pretty direct, fair, blunt question \u2026 That\u2019s straight-up journalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re just trying to do your job, and sometimes it becomes a little more contentious,\u201d says Henry, who is occasionally giving Clinton fits with his headline-making interrogations, such as last week\u2019s dogged grilling of the candidate, during a stopover in Las Vegas, concerning her use of a private email server while secretary of state.\n\n\u201cBut, Ed, you\u2019re not listening to me!\u201d an exasperated Clinton chided at one point, adding, \u201cEd, I know you want to make a point,\u201d as Henry kept asking about the FBI\u2019s criminal investigation of the State Department\u2019s email practices, and Clinton\u2019s press secretary, Nick Merrill, kept trying to cut him off, saying \u201cWe gotta go!\u201d and \u201cThanks very much!\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you wipe the server?\u201d Henry persisted.\n\n\u201cLike with a cloth or something?\u201d Clinton replied\u2014a jokey answer that, judging from the viral attention it received, proved to be too clever by half.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple question,\u201d Henry rejoined.\n\nWhen Clinton turned her back on the press gaggle and walked off, NBC News\u2019s Kristen Welker called out that the email issue \u201cisn\u2019t going to go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one talks to me about it other than you guys,\u201d Clinton protested over her shoulder, shrugging in disgust\u2014the other viral quote from her campaign that day.\n\n\u201cBut there was no arm-waving, there were no raised voices,\u201d Henry says. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that sometimes people believe that TV correspondents are trying to make moments, playing to the camera to force a fight. But I think \u2018Did you wipe the server?\u2019 is a pretty direct, fair, blunt question. She repeatedly refused to answer it and then spent three or four days trying to clean it up. That\u2019s called \u2018news.\u2019 That\u2019s straight-up journalism.\u201d\n\nBack in May, Henry was also the fly-in-the-ointment who interrupted a staged panel discussion with pre-screened Iowans to demand that Clinton\u2014after 40,150 minutes of unavailability\u2014start taking questions from the press.\n\n\u201cI might. I have to ponder it. I will put it on my list for due consideration,\u201d said the candidate, who ultimately relented and, at Henry\u2019s prompting, held her first news conference in a month.\n\n\u201cShe had gone 28 days without taking a question,\u201d Henry recalls. \u201cThey [the campaign staff] got a little mad at me then, because they felt like I was interrupting her. But we had gone, myself and other reporters, to a series of these events, and if you don\u2019t interrupt, she waves and she\u2019s out the back door. And at some point it becomes ridiculous.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cIt sounds goofy, but it\u2019s not just for a \u2018moment,\u2019 it\u2019s for the American people to get some answers to these questions\u2014whether it\u2019s email, whether it\u2019s the Clinton Foundation, whether it\u2019s her economic plan. And I would argue that it\u2019s not serving her well to not take questions for so long. Because now, when she does get questions, she\u2019s struggling.\u201d\n\nWhile Henry says he has decent dealings, and even enjoys an occasional off-the-record drink, with members of Clinton\u2019s senior staff\u2014including a bantering relationship with her closest aide, Huma Abedin\u2014he barely knows the candidate.\n\n\u201cIt seems like she knows my name\u2014she said \u2018Ed\u2019 several times,\u201d he quips about their Las Vegas encounter. \u201cBut I\u2019m more worried about doing caricature coverage, where you\u2019re just doing \u2018She\u2019s got an email problem,\u2019 or \u2018She\u2019s this robot who wants to be president of the United States.\u2019 And if you don\u2019t really get to know the candidate, it\u2019s really hard to understand where they\u2019re coming from...To me she\u2019s a distant figure.\u201d\n\nHenry remains mystified that given his perch on the highest-rated cable news network, he was excluded, as the campaign formally got underway in April, from a couple of off-the-record social events in Washington and Brooklyn between Clinton staffers and political reporters\u2014although it seems clear that if they had to do it all over again (much like the candidate\u2019s recent regrets over her private server), the Clintonistas would have invited him.\n\nHis tie loosened and his suit jacket slung over a chair, Henry is nursing an iced coffee in a sidewalk caf\u00e9 a couple of blocks from Fox News\u2019s Manhattan mothership.\n\nAlthough he doesn\u2019t have his own show, Henry, who is based in Washington, appears pretty much daily on Fox News, often in prime time, and is one of the cable network\u2019s more recognizable franchise players.\n\nWhen he\u2019d sat down a few minutes earlier, another patron\u2014a middle-aged New Yorker dressed much like Henry\u2014had jauntily called out to him, \u201cKeep giving Hillary hell, Ed!\u201d\n\nHenry walked over and thanked the man.\n\n\"Ed\u2019s relentless pursuit of the truth has been on display throughout his coverage of the Clinton campaign, the Obama White House and the Bush administration,\u201d says Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes. \u201cHe\u2019s a tenacious reporter whose ability to ask the hard-hitting questions without losing his likability has enabled him to stand out among the Washington press corps.\u201d\n\nHenry is certainly (as presidential candidate Obama once said about his 2008 rival, Clinton) likable enough; in 2012, he managed to get himself elected president of the White House Correspondents Association, demonstrating that he has political chops of his own.\n\nIt\u2019s an influential post requiring a collegial personality and enough backbone to aggressively argue the case with the president\u2019s spin-meisters for increased access and transparency at the White House, but whose most valuable perk is the authority to parcel out tables to various media outlets at the association\u2019s annual black-tie dinner at the Washington Hilton.\n\nNeedless to say, Fox News did very well table-wise at the 2013 dinner, at which Henry and Fox News Executive Vice President Michael Clemente schmoozed with Obama for three hours on the dais. Henry, however, points out that NBC News obtained as many tables as Fox\u2014an astronomical 14 in the jam-packed basement ballroom.\n\nHenry\u2014who covered Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign for CNN before switching beats to the Obama administration\u2014said there was a noticeable change in the White House attitude toward him after Ailes and Clemente recruited him to Fox during the summer of 2011, as Obama\u2019s reelection effort was ramping up.\n\nFor one thing, he quickly became an especially juicy target for Media Matters, the left-leaning press watchdog group run by Hillary Clinton acolyte David Brock, which started \u201cpainting [Henry] as a right-wing nut job,\u201d according to an article in The Wire, which called the denunciation \u201ca little silly.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Henry clashed repeatedly in the briefing room with White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, a former Time magazine correspondent who had left journalism to work for Vice President Biden, and then was chosen to replace departing Obama loyalist Robert Gibbs.\n\n\u201cPretty awful,\u201d Henry says about his relationship with Carney. \u201cI think Jay is very condescending\u2026Jay could never see past \u2018You\u2019re at Fox, you\u2019re doing it because you\u2019re at Fox.\u2019 He would never look at my record.\u201d\n\nHenry adds: \u201cWith Jay, \u2018Fox\u2019 was always a failsafe. If he didn\u2019t have you on the facts, he was on defense\u2026As a former reporter, Jay went out of his way to let us know, \u2018I\u2019m not on your team, I\u2019m not with the news media, I\u2019m with the White House now.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Henry says he enjoys good rapport with Carney\u2019s successor, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.\n\n\u201cJosh and I have had our moments, and he\u2019s tough but fair. Josh doesn\u2019t throw in a cheap shot,\u201d Henry says. \u201cJosh is much more professional and at the end of the day he does a better job for his boss. He keeps it on the level. He\u2019ll fight you, but he doesn\u2019t make it personal.\u201d\n\nCarney, who today works for Amazon as the online retail giant\u2019s senior vice president for global corporate affairs, fires back: \"More than any Fox News reporter I dealt with, Ed carried the network's political agenda into the briefing room, day after day.\"\n\nThat, however, appears to be a minority view (and despite the proliferation of Republican and right-leaning personalities on Fox News\u2019s programming, the network has long insisted that its straight-news operation has no political agenda. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Jay have bigger things to worry about right now than obsessing about Fox?\u201d says a Fox News spokesperson).\n\nEarnest, for one, tells The Daily Beast: \u201cEd has earned his reputation as a tough reporter, but I\u2019ve also found that although we often disagree, he\u2019s a professional. That means we have an effective working relationship...He\u2019s doing his job effectively, and we\u2019re doing our job effectively...Anybody who\u2019s seen Ed ask a question on camera in the briefing room knows he is not going to pull any punches, but he will usually let you give an answer\u2014which I don\u2019t think I can say about all of his colleagues at other news outlets, by the way.\u201d\n\nClinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill, meanwhile, emailed: \u201cEd can be as colorful as his pocket squares in a press conference, but we like him all the same. He's always the guy that picks up the phone to check his facts with you, and on the \u2018rare\u2019 occasion that FOX airs something we find to be factually flawed, he's there to hear us out, and address it with his colleagues.\u201d\n\nLis Smith, former director of rapid response for Obama\u2019s reelection campaign and currently press secretary to presidential candidate Martin O\u2019Malley, calls Henry \u201ceminently fair. He doesn\u2019t fit the stereotype of the Fox News reporter who shows up and shoves a camera in your face...I think he\u2019s a huge asset to Fox because he comes across as someone who approaches his reporting with an unbiased perspective.\u201d\n\nHenry, who is married to NPR Washington producer Shirley Hung and has a teenage son and daughter from a previous marriage, hails from Queens and grew up, the son of a grocer and bookkeeper, in the Long Island town of Deer Park. After graduating from St. John the Baptist High School\u2014where he was taught by Franciscan friars and wrote for the school newspaper, The Promethean\u2014he attended Siena College in Albany.\n\nHe left before graduation for a $250-a-week job with Jack Anderson, the famed investigative Washington columnist who was entering his dotage and whose column was published in The Washington Post\u2019s comics section. \u201cSo I know what it\u2019s like to be an outcast sometimes,\u201d Henry says, noting that he caught the journalism bug in a Senate hearing room one night in 1991 as embattled Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas complained of a \u201chigh-tech lynching.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought, wow, I want to be in the middle of this,\u201d Henry recalls. \u201cThe whole thing was a spectacle, but there were real issues on the line.\u201d\n\nAfter securing his college degree by attending night classes at American University, he went on to work for Roll Call, eventually becoming managing editor of the Congress-focused newspaper, and sought out career advice from influential pundit Robert Novak, who, over breakfast at the Army-Navy Club in 2003, told Henry to look into television.\n\nIt was the curmudgeonly Novak, Henry says, who helped him move to CNN, where Novak was an on-air contributor. In a celebrated incident two years later, Henry was anchoring a live segment with Novak when the columnist took offense at a comment by fellow panelist James Carville, uttering the word \u201cbullshit\u201d and storming off the set\u2014before Henry could ask him about his role in the outing of CIA employee Valerie Plame, the subject of a criminal investigation.\n\n\u201cNovak flipped out and started yelling at me, \u2018How could you do this?\u2019\u201d\u2014referring to Henry\u2019s intention to grill his onetime mentor and advocate about the awkward Plame incident. \u201cBut I thought I was just doing my job.\u201d\n\nStill steaming about the encounter shortly before his death, Novak called Henry in his memoir, The Prince of Darkness, a \u201cduplicitous phony.\u201d\n\nA decade later, Henry says he feels fortunate to be working at Fox and \u201cexhilarated\u201d by the constant adventure of campaign coverage, but is nurturing higher ambitions for his career after the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cYou always want to take on more, and you always want to be rewarded for it,\u201d he says, noting that he re-upped last years and every so often talks with Ailes about his future. Apparently a program of his own is not in the cards just yet.\n\n\u201cEvery day part is spoken for and Mr. Ailes has told me that,\u201d he says. \u201cI love all my colleagues. We\u2019re winning every hour. He doesn\u2019t need anybody else. Hopefully there will be a new challenge that he\u2019ll throw my way, and I will eagerly accept it.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:17.963+0000"}

It\u2019s already been forced to temporarily shut down, after many of its thousand-plus members are trolls calling themselves things like \u201cAlbradorft Lincler,\u201d \u201cAl Zheimers,\u201d and \u201cBen Ghazi.\u201d The site runs tremendously slowly, and its attempts to interact with members through a messaging platform have proven fruitless. There\u2019s hardly any involvement in thought-provoking (and clearly troll-created) pages like \u201cCut Dicks for Christ,\u201d which simply says: \u201cCalling all cut dicks.\u201d\n\nBut a page devoted to the metal band Slayer has garnered the likes of \u201cDick Cheney,\u201d \u201cManuel Noriega,\u201d and \u201cIsrael.\u201d An impressive roster of interested parties for a website that has only been around for a day.\n\nPorter, who is the president of Faith2Action, \u201ca pro-life, pro-family\u201d advocacy group that wants to \u201cADVANCE the cause of Christ and the kingdom of God,\u201d did not return a request for comment from The Daily Beast about her fledgling Internet venture.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s easy to chalk up ReaganBook as an abject failure, loading at a snail\u2019s pace and overrun by trolls, Facebook has given conservatives incentive to go rogue in the past.\n\n\u201cTomorrow Facebook employees are gathering to go march at the gay pride parade in San Francisco,\u201d Porter said last weekend at the Ohio Liberty Coalition event called Reload 4 Liberty.\n\n\u201cWhile they kick people off [Facebook] who happen to have an unpopular belief, like being in favor of marriage\u2014a buddy of mine Peter LaBarbera, [of] Americans for Truth\u2014taken off Facebook. They\u2019re censoring things and I\u2019m saying we shouldn\u2019t use it,\u201d Porter said.\n\nPorter was referencing an organization called Americans for Truth about Homosexuality, \u201ca national organization devoted exclusively to exposing and countering the homosexual activist agenda,\u201d according to its website. She alleges that the Illinois-based group, whose most recent campaign involved pressuring Starbucks to take down an ad portraying two lesbian mothers, has been censored on Facebook. But it\u2019s clear that they have an active page, helping them to wage their \u201cculture war.\u201d\n\nLaBarbera did not responded to a request for comment from The Daily Beast.\n\nReaganBook shows no discernable signs of longevity.

The popular page for conservative media site Chicks on the Right, run by Amy Jo Clark and Miriam Weaver, was briefly shut down after a 2013 post which read: \u201cJay Carney can kiss my assular area.\u201d At the time, Facebook apologized for issuing a block to the page.\n\nWeaver and Jo Clark were far from bowled over when they visited ReaganBook.com.\n\n\u201cWe noticed a lot of pornographic photos right on the front page when we first looked at it,\u201d Weaver said. She and Clark were quick to recognize that the site closely resembled the earlier Facebook conservative knockoff The Tea Party Community, which looks quite a bit like Zuckerberg\u2019s original brainchild.\n\nKen Crow, a proud Texan and co-founder of the Tea Party Community, told The Daily Beast that he was happy ReaganBook exists.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled,\u201d Crow said, having not explored the site yet. \u201cListen, if Warren Buffett or whoever \u2013I just went blank\u2014Mr. [Sheldon] Adelson put $100 million and said \u2018Let\u2019s do this. Let\u2019s build the world\u2019s largest social media platform for conservatives,\u2019 I would be thrilled. Because our goal was to try to make a difference in America.\u201d\n\nCrow, who intersperses conversations with the affable label \u201cmy friend,\u201d wants to change the face of American politics with conservative social media, as he is convinced corporate interests at Facebook promote liberal ideologies.\n\nBut ReaganBook is struggling to even begin an intelligent dialogue. \u201cI think they\u2019d attract more people and less trolls if they didn\u2019t put that brand on it of Reagan. If they called it something else,\u201d Clark said. Clark and Weaver suggested that the site\u2019s branding is essentially offering itself up for people to do outlandish things (like creating fan pages devoted to the mammaries of the former President).\n\nThe decision by Porter to abandon Facebook seems predicated on the notion that its Silicon Valley staff is actively policing conservative content\u2014something that Weaver and Clark quickly dismissed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any kind of Facebook staff conspiracy at all,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cI think they all have a job to do and they\u2019re doing it. And they\u2019re dealing with literally over a billion people. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a Facebook issue, I think it\u2019s a Facebook audience issue.\u201d\n\nThis is the very audience that led to their page getting shut down. The problem, as Weaver and Clark explained, is that this group drools at the opportunity to troll something like ReaganBook. And they seem to be prevailing as ReaganBook first entered \u201coffline mode\u201d by 3 p.m. Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI hate to sound pessimistic because I don\u2019t know anything about the people that started this,\u201d Weaver said prior to the site shutting down. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be \u2018Captain Bringdown\u2019 about it, but I would not join this page.\u201d\n\nThe site administrators effectively pulled the plug on ReaganBook less than 24 hours after its launch.\n\n\u201cThank you to all those who participated in the pre-release of ReaganBook.com,\u201d a message credited to \u201cManagement\u201d said on the site late Wednesday afternoon. \u201cYour participation is helping us build a more secure site. Thank you! Please be patient while we make the necessary changes to keep the site free from obscenity, pornography, and those intent on the destruction of life, liberty, and the family. We will be opening the doors again soon with additional protections in place. As Reagan taught us, trust, but verify.\u201d\n\nCrow explained that his site put preventative measures in place to preclude trolls from reigning. He remained steadfast in his belief in the promise of the conservative social network.\n\n\u201cIf someone is able to pull it off, it\u2019ll be able to change politics in America,\u201d he said.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:18.287+0000"}

But truth be told, I never came close to mastering the language despite my excellent grades.\n\n\n\nI did not deserve them.\n\nWhile I accepted every A- and B+ as a gift from the school gods, Brother Victor Serna was forever chastising me for slacking off from my \u201cusual\u201d stellar A/A+ efforts.\n\nBrother Victor had taught my brother, Jeff, the previous year with far greater success. After years at the head of a parochial school classroom, he could no longer distinguish one blond Irish Catholic kid from another. I coasted through Spanish II on Jeff\u2019s stellar effort.\n\n\n\nWhat I won\u2019t ever forget were Brother Victor\u2019s periodic anti-communist tirades. His face a brilliant crimson, neck veins bulging and spittle flying, he looked like America\u2019s most famous Cuban, Ricky Ricardo, after Lucy had pissed him off and left him sputtering in his native tongue.\n\nA Spaniard by birth, Victor Serna left home shy of his 14th birthday and entered the monastery to become a Marist brother. By 1943, he was missioned to Cienfuegos, Cuba.\n\nIn 1950, Serna earned his Ph.D. from the University of Havana, where he had befriended a classmate named Fidel Castro.\n\n\n\nBy 1961 Castro had seized power and Serna publicly criticized his old friend for his regime\u2019s barbaric suppression of individual and religious rights. This courageous act earned him a late-night knock on the door with orders for Serna to vamos from Cuba. He had 24 hours to pack.\n\nHe never returned.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to ask exactly what we got other than the return of Alan Gross. Right now it looks like the diplomatic equivalent of one hand clapping.\n\n\u201cI do not believe we can keep doing the same thing for over five decades and expect a different result,\u201d said President Obama as he announced his intention to undo the policy of isolation followed by the previous 10 presidents.\n\nThe prison camp island nation known as Cuba erupted in celebration.\n\nCloser to home, the reaction has been mixed.\n\nWith the midterm elections safely in the rearview mirror, Obama is on legacy patrol.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is safely embedded, with repeal unlikely even with a freshly minted Republican Senate. His executive order granting work privileges and immunity from deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants may be headed to court, but not any time soon. Now he\u2019s taking a radical new approach to the hemisphere\u2019s only Stalinist government.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to argue for the continuation of the U.S. embargo of Cuba. If the embargo were effective, the Castro brothers would have been doing Love Letters with the Duvaliers years ago. We trade with China and Vietnam, so why not Cuba, right?\n\nWell, here\u2019s one big reason to continue the embargo: Trade with Cuba strengthens the regime.\n\nThe Cuban government siphons off revenue from nearly every business transaction in the country. Until 2011, barbers were employees of the state. While cruise ship companies would like nothing more than to add Havana to their ports of call, the people of Cuba will still be paid a pittance. The average Cuban makes between $20 and $50 a month.\n\nThat\u2019s not a typo.\n\nOn the upside, we\u2019re likely to get better jazz, slick fielding middle infielders, and an army of great mechanics.\n\nGranted, we\u2019ve been waiting for half a century for the Cuban economy to collapse.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t. Not even after its parent company, the Soviet Union, took a dive in 1991.\n\nObama has latched on to the failure of the embargo to topple the Castros as justification to shuffle the deck. But does he really want the Castos toppled? If so he has yet to say so publicly.\n\nWhat he has said publicly is an apology for colonialism, something we are not guilty of in Cuba. The only other thing he has offered is vague boilerplate about a more \u201copen\u201d Cuba in the future after exposure to \u201cAmerican values.\u201d\n\nBut the blunt truth is that nothing we do will free the Cuban people as long as they are subjugated by a thuggish government modeled on Stalin\u2019s police state. Our secret weapon may be the hardening of Fidel\u2019s and Raul\u2019s arteries.\n\nPoverty in the Caribbean worker\u2019s paradise is not the result of America\u2019s embargo. It\u2019s the result of decades of draconian socialism.\n\nWhile the president correctly points out that the United States is the only country with an embargo on Cuba, he misses the obvious point: If the Cubans are free to trade with the rest of the world, why aren\u2019t they driving Subarus and Fiats?\n\nCanada, Mexico, China, Japan, Germany, France, and every other nation on earth does business with Cuba, but the people there are still driving \u201956 DeSotos, and many lack Internet access and nearly every other tool of the modern world. The reason? Fidel and Raul Castro.\n\nObama\u2019s gambit is not irrational. Insanity, after all, is doing the same thing and expecting a different result, right? But the president\u2019s new policy is naive.\n\nFor all his gifts, Obama has had one consistent glaring blind spot: He\u2019s a terrible judge of tyrants. The Castros are the latest in a long line of despots he believed he could negotiate with.\n\nFrom Vladimir Putin to Hosni Mubarak to Bashar al-Assad and the Kim du jour in North Korea, Obama seems the last person to recognize the monstrous evil these thugs represent.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to ask exactly what we got in the president\u2019s bargain with Cuba other than the return of Alan Gross. Right now it looks like the diplomatic equivalent of one hand clapping.\n\nWhile the days of exploding cigars are happily behind us, the iron grip of an intolerant despot has not and is not likely to loosen under Obama any more than it did in the days of JFK.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:18.549+0000"}
{"entityId": 1910, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton is a classic tax-and-spend liberal. So why is his state walloping Scott Walker\u2019s Wisconsin in terms of economic growth?\n\nWisconsin and Minnesota share a common cultural heritage that until recently included a healthy Midwestern strain of progressive politics. Elected in 2010, Governor Scott Walker upended a hundred years of liberal populism, charting a conservative path for Wisconsin that made him a darling of the Republican Right, but left his state with a serious budget shortfall and disappointing job growth.\n\nMeanwhile, across the border in neighboring Minnesota, Governor Mark Dayton has relentlessly pursued liberal policies, embodying the tax-and-spend Democrat that Republicans love to caricature. The result, surprising to many, is that the Minnesota economy is going gangbusters while Wisconsin\u2019s job growth has fallen to 44th among the 50 states.\n\nDayton\u2019s success steering his state\u2019s progressive course has been a surprise. He was a middling senator at best, serving a single term from 2001 to 2007 before returning to Minnesota disillusioned with the way Washington operated. Time named him one of America\u2019s \u201cFive Worst Senators\u201d in 2006, and he was known mainly for his inherited fortune as the great-grandson of the founder of Dayton\u2019s department store, which became Target. As senator, he donated his salary to underwrite bus trips to Canada for senior citizens buying low-cost prescription drugs.\n\n\u201cMinnesota\u2019s gains are not because Mark Dayton has overpowered the state with his political acumen,\u201d says Lawrence Jacobs, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota. He describes the low-key Dayton as the \u201canti-politician,\u201d someone the voters trust because he\u2019s not smooth enough to fool them. \u201cHis skill is he has a clear agenda, and he\u2019s unyielding. This is not pie-in-the-sky Great Society adventurism.\u201d\n\nDayton has a majority Democratic legislature just as Walker has a Republican controlled legislature, bolstering the ongoing policy experiment in their states. The two governors have pursued agendas that mirror their respective party\u2019s core beliefs, and the results so far suggest that the starve-the-government, tax-cutting credo of conservative orthodoxy has run its course.\n\nDayton has raised the minimum wage, and he\u2019s significantly increased taxes on the top 2 percent of wage earners to close a budget shortfall and to raise money for investments in infrastructure and education. In the legislative session that just ended, some Democrats joined with Republicans to block his goal of expanding universal preschool. But he did get more scholarship money to educate 4-year-olds.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest tax increase we\u2019ve seen in Minnesota, over $2 billion,\u201d says Jacobs. More than three-quarters of the new spending is on education, compared to Wisconsin, where education is on the chopping block, and Walker is at odds with professors and administrators alike at his state\u2019s flagship university system.\n\nMinnesota has also passed the state\u2019s version of the Affordable Care Act (MNsure), and while its implementation has been rocky, it is in place and serving tens of thousands of people.\n\nDayton ran for governor in 2010 on an unapologetically liberal agenda, and won narrowly after a recount. He was reelected comfortably in 2014, and his approval rating in the latest Minneapolis Star Tribune poll is 54 percent. Contrast that with Walker\u2019s 41 percent, and you\u2019ve got a clear picture of how each is faring in the eyes of voters.\n\nDayton\u2019s idiosyncratic style is in tune with the times, and at 68, he has no ambition for national office. Walker is running for president and touting hard-right policies that play well with Iowa caucusgoers. He opposed raising the minimum wage, has significantly weakened unions, reduced spending for education, cut taxes on the wealthy, and increased taxes on the middle class in part to pay for the tax cut. According to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Budget Project, Walker gave tax breaks that disproportionally favored upper-income earners while cutting $56 million in tax credits for working families.\n\nFaced with a budget shortfall and no way to plug it without additional revenue, Republicans in the Wisconsin legislature are rebelling against additional spending cuts. But Walker shows no sign of softening his stance against raising taxes or fees. Other Republican governors, notably Louisiana\u2019s Bobby Jindal, are in the same quandary.\n\n\u201cIt seems like they\u2019ve been backed into a corner and are just going forward with pure ideology and discounting any contradictory evidence,\u201d says David Madland, author of Hollowed Out: Why the Economy Doesn\u2019t Work without a Strong Middle Class.\n\nAs the director of the American Worker Project at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, Madland in his book takes on the premise that inequality is good in the sense that helping the rich get richer is going to help everybody else, that a rising tide lifts all boats. Trickle-down economics has gotten a bad rap and is rarely invoked as a phrase anymore, but the belief that tax cuts are the engine of economic growth remains the core of GOP ideology.\n\nThat Minnesota\u2019s economy rallied under progressive policies while Wisconsin\u2019s has struggled is \u201cone more data point proving that trickle down is wrong,\u201d says Madland. While it\u2019s tricky to attribute the well-being of a state\u2019s economy solely to its political leadership, Minnesota is experiencing much stronger growth than its neighbor. Dayton has also proved responsive to the business community, easing early fears that his liberalism might go unchecked.\n\nWalker, on the other hand, has doubled down to the detriment of his state on policies that are backfiring. And if voters in his home state aren\u2019t buying what he\u2019s selling anymore, that doesn\u2019t bode well for his presidential campaign.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:19.300+0000"}
{"entityId": 1911, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "No greater number of police officers is being shot this year than in any other. But we do see more brutality because of social media.\n\nThere\u2019s no excuse for the brazen, chilling murder of Harris County Sheriff Darren Goforth, who was shot repeatedly while fueling his police cruiser at a Texas gas station and whose funeral is Friday.\n\nBut there\u2019s also no excuse for attempts by law enforcement, media, and politicians to claim that the unmotivated killing is part of a \u201cwar on cops\u201d or in any way related to the Black Lives Matter movement or other people critical of law enforcement and police brutality.\n\nTo do so is simply to wave away a decade-long decline in confidence in police that has everything to do with behavior by law enforcement, not the citizens they serve. According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans with \u201ca great deal/quite a lot of confidence\u201d in police has dropped from 64 percent in 2004 to just 52 percent, its lowest number in 22 years.\n\nThe suspect in Goforth\u2019s murder, Shannon Miles, has a long history of violence and mental problems, including being declared \u201cmentally incompetent\u201d to stand trial in 2012 on felony assault charges. Connecting Miles\u2019 horrific crimes to anything other than his own twisted mind makes as much sense as linking Jared Loughner, who shot former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords, to the Tea Party or Sarah Palin PAC advertisements. Which is to say: None at all (Loughner was not just nuts, to the extent he followed the news, he watched MSNBC and UFO conspiracy docs.)\n\nThe rising use of body cameras all over the country isn\u2019t being done to document a \u201cwar on cops\u201d but to promote essential peace and trust between citizens and police.\n\nYet at a press conference announcing Miles\u2019s arrest, Sheriff Ron Hickman argued that \u201cvery dangerous national rhetoric\u201d that\u2019s critical of law enforcement is at least partly to blame. \u201cWhen rhetoric ramps up to the point where cold-blooded assassination has happened, this rhetoric has gotten out of control,\u201d Hickman said. \u201cWe heard \u2018black lives matter.\u2019 All lives matter. Well, cops\u2019 lives matter too, so why don\u2019t we drop the qualifier and say \u2018lives matter\u2019 and take that to the bank.\u201d\n\nHickman\u2019s sentiments echo throughout police departments around the country. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know you,\u201d one Arizona cop told the Los Angeles Times, \u201cI\u2019m going to be extra guarded around you\u2026 It is a different world.\u201d Such thoughts are resounding especially loudly in media outlets such as Fox News, where hosts ranging from staid morning-show business reporter Stuart Varney to primetime blowhard Sean Hannity have been quick to adopt the \u201cwar on cops\u201d motif. Ted Cruz, never one not to hitch a ride on a media bandwagon, has also gotten into the act. \u201cCops across this country are feeling the assault,\u201d says the Texas Republican and presidential hopeful. \u201cThey\u2019re feeling the assault from the president, from the top on down as we see.\u201d\n\nSuch reactions are not just grotesquely opportunistic, they\u2019re wrong in two fundamental ways.\n\nFirst\u2014and most importantly\u2014there is no \u201cwar on cops,\u201d if the term suggests increasingly brazen and numerous open \u201cexecutions\u201d of police officers. The National Law Enforcement Officers Fund, which tracks police deaths, finds that the number of police killed in assaults so far this year is 25, the same as last year. The FBI says that while the number of cops \u201cfeloniously killed\u201d each year has fluctuated over the past decade, \u201cit stands at about 50.\u201d As my Reason colleague Ed Krayewski writes, \u201cIn 2007, there were 67 cops shot and killed in the line of duty. In 2007 there was no \u2018national conversation\u2019 about police reform, no sustained focus on criminal justice reform, nothing in the national zeitgeist that would suggest the number of murders were the result of anything more than the number of people who had killed cops that year.\u201d\n\nSecond, to the extent that there is serious discussion about reforming criminal justice practices, it is driven by highly publicized cases of overreaction or brutality by law enforcement that is increasingly visible due to smart phone cameras and social media. The 2011 case of Kelly Thomas, a 37-year-old schizophrenic drifter beaten to death by Fullerton, California, police, perfectly illustrates the real \u201cnew world\u201d faced by police. It was only after Thomas\u2019s father took gruesome pictures of his comatose son\u2019s severely battered body and face and shared them via social media that public pressure grew for a full investigation and trial.\n\nIn the past year alone, high-profile events in Ferguson, Staten Island, Troy, Ohio and elsewhere have sparked a nationwide movement to rethink not just policing strategies but also the ways in which race factors into law enforcement and how local governments abuse their power to levy fines and fees on their poorest residents. The rising use of body cameras all over the country isn\u2019t being done to document a \u201cwar on cops\u201d but to promote essential peace and trust between citizens and police.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad coincidence that Darren Goforth\u2019s funeral will take place just as the trial begins for the officers accused in the death of Freddie Gray, the Baltimore man who died this year from injuries suffered during police custody.\n\nBy all accounts, Goforth was an honorable man and a credit to law enforcement and his murder is as tragic and disturbing as it is senseless. But if his brothers and sisters in blue and their partisans in politics and the press simply use his killing as an excuse to avoid ongoing reform, there\u2019s no reason to believe public confidence in the police will rebound any time soon.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:19.815+0000"}

Those old enough to know what I\u2019m talking about when I say \u201cAl Campanis\u201d will remember that that was one of your more extreme cases. The exchange between Bill Maher and Ben Affleck on last Friday\u2019s Real Time wasn\u2019t a Campanis moment, but I knew instantly\u2014watching it in, well, real time, as it were\u2014that this was going to spark discussion, as indeed it has.\n\nIn case you missed it, the two\u2014both committed and thoughtful liberals\u2014got into it on the question of whether Western liberals can or should criticize Islam. Mentioning freedom of speech and equal rights, Maher said: \u201cThese are liberal principles that liberals applaud for, but then when you say in the Muslim world, this is what\u2019s lacking, then they get upset.\u201d Sam Harris, the atheist author, agreed with Maher and said, \u201cThe crucial point of confusion is that we have been sold this meme of Islamophobia where every criticism of the doctrine of Islam gets conflated with bigotry towards Muslims as people. That is intellectually ridiculous.\u201d Affleck, as if on cue, challenged Harris: \u201cAre you the person who understands the officially codified doctrine of Islam?\u201d And then: \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that Islamophobia is not a real thing?\u201d Right after, Affleck said that such criticisms of Islam were \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d and \u201clike saying [to Maher] \u2018you\u2019re a shifty Jew.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was cracking good TV, but it was more\u2014it hit home because they were describing one of the most important debates within liberalism of the last...10 years certainly, as pertains to Islam, but 40 or 50 years as relates to arguments between the developed and the developing world, and close to a century when it comes to discussions of how culture should affect our understanding of universal, or as some would have it \u201cuniversal,\u201d principles. Reluctance to criticize the failures of other cultures has been a problem within contemporary liberalism, with negative consequences I\u2019ll go into below. So this liberal is firmly on Maher\u2019s side, even as I recognize that his rendering is something of a caricature.\n\nHere\u2019s some quick history for you. First, the Enlightenment happened, and humankind developed the idea of universal rights. \u2019Round about the 1920s, some scholars in the then-newish field of cultural anthropology started to argue that all rights, or at least values, were not universal, and that we (the West) should be careful about imposing our values on societies with traditions and customs so removed from our own.\n\nIt should be, and should have been, a core part of the mission of liberalism to support secular humanists and small-d democrats from all over the world, but from the Muslim world in particular.\n\nA big moment here came with the debate over the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which asserted the universalist position without apology and which was pushed mostly by mainstream political liberals (Eleanor Roosevelt most notably). There were many critiques of the declaration from what we would today call \u201cthe left,\u201d but those voices had little juice in those days, and when the UN adopted the declaration, it was a great victory for liberalism.\n\nFade in, fade out. Then came the anti-colonialist uprisings of the 1950s, Frantz Fanon, postmodern political theory, Vietnam, the Israeli occupation, the intifada, et cetera et cetera. All of these and many other kindred events seeped into the liberal bloodstream, still rich in universalist cells but now also coursing with the competing cells of cultural relativism (invariably a pejorative these days, although it wasn\u2019t always).\n\nAnd so, yes, we have seen in recent years from liberalism, or at least from some liberals (a crucial distinction, in fact), an unwillingness to criticize the reactionary aspects or expressions of other cultures, expressions that these liberals would have no hesitation whatsover in criticizing if they were exhibited by, say, Southern white Christians.\n\nThe most obvious example that comes to mind is that of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the Muslim-African-Dutch-and-finally-American feminist intellectual. She of course is famous, now mostly for some of her more incendiary comments, but recall how she first became so: She and her collaborator, Theo van Gogh, had made a film critical of the oppression of women in the Muslim world. He was murdered, and she received death threats. She fled to the United States.\n\nNow, here was a key moment: When she came to America in 2006, where was Hirsi Ali going to plant her flag? As she tells the story in her book Nomad, she met with liberal and conservative outfits. She says the liberal ones were \u201ctentative\u201d in their support for her and her ideas, but the conservative American Enterprise Institute embraced her totally, even though on certain issues (like abortion rights) she\u2019s no conservative.\n\nHirsi Ali, of course, has subsequently gone on to say, quite controversially, that not just radical Islam but \u201cIslam, period\u201d must be \u201cdefeated.\u201d But here\u2019s the question: Before she started talking like that, why was she unable to find a home within American liberalism? It should be, and should have been, a core part of the mission of liberalism to support secular humanists and small-d democrats from all over the world, but from the Muslim world in particular. Most of these people are themselves liberals by Western standards, and they are desperate for the United States to do what it can to oppose the theocracies and autocracies under which they\u2019re forced to live.\n\nMaher, and certainly conservative critics, overstate the extent to which liberals fail to make common cause with such folks. Christian evangelicals who do work on, say, genital mutilation (which Hirsi Ali suffered) get a lot more attention in the media, because it\u2019s more \u201cinteresting\u201d that white conservatives give a crap about something happening to nonwhite women halfway across the world. But as the writer Michelle Goldberg pointed out in a review of Hirsi Ali\u2019s Nomad for the journal I edit, Democracy, numerous women\u2019s organizations and feminist groups do work to advance women\u2019s rights in the Muslim world.\n\nGoldberg wrote: \u201cA few years ago, I visited Tasaru Ntomonok, which is the kind of place Hirsi Ali would probably love\u2014it\u2019s a Kenyan shelter that houses and educates girls fleeing female genital mutilation and forced marriage. Among its supporters are the high profile feminist Eve Ensler, the feminist NGO Equality Now, and the United Nations Population Fund, a b\u00eate noire of many conservatives. There are similar grassroots organizations working toward women\u2019s liberation all over the world.\u201d\n\nEven so, Maher has identified a problem within Western liberalism today. Debates about multiculturalism are appropriate to a later stage of development of the infrastructure of rights and liberties than one finds in some other parts of the world. That infrastructure has existed in Western countries for a century, and it is the very fact that it was so solidly entrenched that opened up the space for us to start having debates about multiculturalism in the 1970s and \u201980s.\n\nBut in much of the Arab and Muslim world, that infrastructure barely exists. So\u2014and how\u2019s this for a paradox?\u2014to insist that our Western standards that call for multiculturalist values should be applied to countries that haven\u2019t yet fully developed the basic rights infrastructure constitutes its own kind of imposition of our values onto them. A liberated woman or a gay man who lives in a country where being either of those things is at best unaccepted and at worst illegal doesn\u2019t need multiculturalism. They\u2019re desperate for a little universalism, and we Western liberals need to pay more attention to this.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:20.067+0000"}

As you may have guessed, considering \u201cfamily\u201d is in its name, the group lobbies against equal rights for the LGBT community, as well as against the right to choose, embryonic stem-cell research, and pornography. This crowd has never been the most natural fit for Paul who, in 2012, told the summit \u201cmy faith has never been easy for me. Never been easy to talk about and never been without obstacles.\u201d\n\nBut although he\u2019s best known for his libertarian stances, Paul\u2014who is pro-life and believes marriage should be decided at the state level\u2014has long identified as a social conservative. He\u2019s just never been as comfortable discussing social issues as the Mike Huckabees of the world\u2014or, for the matter, the Ted Cruzs.\n\nCruz strolled out onstage, microphone pinned to his shiny blue striped tie, and delivered his message in his traditional fashion: pacing around the stage, and moving his hands dramatically in the air in a way reminiscent of a televangelist, or someone trying to sell you a blender on the Home Shopping Network.\n\nCruz wove in and out of scripture, telling the crowd that the Republican Party must \u201coffer a choice, not an echo,\u201d and that \u201cwe don\u2019t paint in pale pastels, we paint in bold colors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are dangerous, extreme, radical times,\u201d Cruz warned. If you call today, Cruz will help to defeat Obamacare; but if you call right now, Cruz will work to abolish the IRS. Call now!\n\nThe crowd did not seem to notice Cruz\u2019s blatant pandering\u2014or if they did, they didn\u2019t mind. They were up on their feet so often to applaud the Texas senator that his speech was practically an aerobics class. Paul\u2019s reception, meanwhile, was markedly less enthusiastic.\n\nCruz wove in and out of scripture, telling the crowd that the Republican Party must \"offer a choice, not an echo,\" and that \"we don't paint in pale pastels, we paint in bold colors.\u201d\n\nRed tie and blue shirt-clad Paul walked casually in front of the audience and, like a normal person, stood behind the podium. He calmly offered his vision of an ideology that merges libertarian values with social conservative virtue. Paul\u2019s speech\u2014like most speeches at events like this\u2014touched on a wide-range of topics, and often shifted a bit uneasily between them. He began with foreign policy, weaved into abortion and the persecution of Christians, and then moved back to foreign policy.\n\nPaul predictably criticized Obama for his \u201carrogance\u201d and for failing to get military action in the Middle East approved by Congress. \u201cIf I had been president,\u201d he said\u2014not that he\u2019s running yet!\u2014he would have done it differently, constitutionally.\n\nAlthough he did warn that the country is in the midst of a \u201cspiritual crisis\u201d that is eating away at its foundation, Paul avoided scripture, electing instead to quote Thomas Paine, the conservative writer Os Guiness, Catholic novelist Walker Percy, and Reagan advisor Don Devine.\n\nNeedless to say, Cruz\u2019s performance went over better with the crowd. But while Paul\u2019s continued unwillingness to act like a preacher may not lead to uproarious standing ovations at social conservative conferences, it may be the very thing that convinces other factions of the electorate that he is not a phony.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:20.835+0000"}

Need we say more?\n\nRick Santorum, the man who brought us such \u201chits\u201d as our \u201cour civil laws have to comport\u201d with the Bible, gay sex is the equivalent of \u201cman on dog\u201d sex, and contraception is \u201cnot okay,\u201d now brings us a new documentary: One Generation Away: The Erosion of Religious Liberty.\n\nOn Monday, as the Supreme Court announced its \u201cHobby Lobby\u201d decision, Santorum\u2019s film production company, EchoLight Studios, announced that its new documentary that will explore the issue of religious liberty. So what can we expect from this film slated to open in September? Well, the trailer gives us some clues.\n\nIt opens with chilling, ominous music. There are people pleading for religious liberty such as Mike Huckabee, the guy who stated while running for president in 2008 that \u201cwhat we need to do is amend the Constitution so it\u2019s in God\u2019s standards rather than trying to change God\u2019s standards so it lines up with some contemporary view\u2026\u201d\n\nThen we see the bad guys: Two men in suits\u2014I assume government agents\u2014who are using a two-person saw to slowly cut down a huge cross. Over this image we hear: \u201cFreedom is never more than one generation from extinction.\u201d\n\nI know, this is getting scary. And it gets worse. Images of a Hobby Lobby store fly by as the two men in suits feverishly cut through the cross. The cross slowly (and in black-and-white) falls to the ground as we are told that religious freedom is under attack in America.\n\nAnd then\u2014boom: Nazi imagery fills the screen. Hitler is ranting away, we see Nazi flags, and nuns imprisoned in Nazi jails.\n\nAll seems lost. But then, out of the darkness, we hear the voice of our hero, Ronald Reagan, telling us it\u2019s not too late if we stand up now for freedom. But Reagan warns that if we don\u2019t fight, \u201cWe will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children\u2019s children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.\u201d\n\nI know what you are thinking: Why is Santorum waiting to open this film in September? It has all the hallmarks of a summer blockbuster: Americans fighting for freedom, bad government agents, and Nazis. Throw in an X-Man whose special power is preserving religious liberty and you have the makings of a movie franchise.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if Santorum doesn\u2019t know there are other faiths in the United States. After all, he\u2019s badmouthed enough of them.\n\nThe goal is not to educate, of course, but to scare people. It\u2019s a call to arms to Christians that in the near future the government will be imprisoning its religious leaders and cutting down crosses while liberals are turning America into Nazi Germany.\n\nPerhaps Santorum is unaware of this, but when you cite the Nazis to bolster your argument, it\u2019s a sign to rational people that you have no facts to support your assertions. Going Nazi means you have lost the argument.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the intriguing thing. If you watch the trailer, you get a sense that when Santorum speaks of \u201creligious liberty,\u201d he only means one religion. Want to guess which faith? That\u2019s too easy\u2014it\u2019s like a $100 question on Jeopardy: \u201cWhat is Christianity?\u201d It\u2019s the only religion shown in the trailer.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if Santorum doesn\u2019t know there are other faiths in the United States. After all, he\u2019s badmouthed enough of them. Who can forget Santorum in 2012 saying that the concept of \u201cequality\u201d is found only in Judeo-Christian faiths, not \u201cEast and Eastern religions\u201d such as Sikhism or Hinduism. And Santorum was kind enough to \u201cremind\u201d us that some Christians view Mormonism as a \u201cdangerous cult.\u201d Very kind of him to make sure we didn\u2019t forget that.\n\n\n\nBut if we are really talking religious liberty in America, there is one faith that certainly has borne its fair share of attacks in recent years. Want to guess which one? Of course, good ol\u2019 Rick would tell us that\u2019s Christianity, but that\u2019s just the victimhood in him speaking. I\u2019m talking Islam. (I know, you knew that.)\n\nMuslims in America have even been compelled to wage battles to open places of worship, such as the current controversy over a proposed mosque in northern New Jersey. However, since Santorum has called for Muslims to be profiled by law enforcement simply because of our faith, maybe I should thank God or Allah (they are the same, by the way) that he left us out of the trailer. I would imagine he would portray us like we are all card-carrying members of ISIS.\n\nBut let\u2019s be candid here, being fair and balanced doesn\u2019t matter for the audience Santorum is targeting. He\u2019s giving his base red meat, which apparently is all they like to eat. (We\u2019ve seen how angry the right became when Michelle Obama suggested more vegetables for their kids.)\n\nThe truth is that Santorum may in fact hit box office gold with this film. Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s 2012 documentary, 2016: Obama\u2019s America, became the No. 2 political documentary of all time, raking in $33.4 million in ticket sales. (It\u2019s second\u2014by some distance\u2014to Michael Moore\u2019s Fahrenheit 9/11.) Regardless of the box office numbers, I\u2019m happy Santorum is making films. It\u2019s far better than Santorum making public policy.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:21.095+0000"}

He wore a khaki blazer and his hair was slicked back. In a few minutes, Christie himself would come out, and he would announce, like Giuliano always knew he would, that he is running for president.\n\n\u201cHe was pretty blunt when he was a kid and he\u2019s pretty honest now,\u201d Giuliano remarked in a voice that sounded a lot like Christie\u2019s.\n\nJust outside the gym, their baseball team photo hung on the wall.\n\n\u201cI spoke to him last night,\u201d Giuliano told me. \u201cAnd I said to him, \u2018I remember writing in your yearbook: Maybe one day you will be president. Do you still have it?\u2019\u201d Giuliano laughed. \u201cAnd he said \u2018No, I lost it in the flood!\u2019\u201d\n\nToday, Christie became the 14th Republican to enter the primary. His announcement comes on the heels of a cascade of grim statistics: An in-state approval rating of 30 percent; 44 percent of voters who think he\u2019s full of shit; not even half of the jobs the state lost during the recession recovered; and an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent, considerably higher than the 5.5 percent national average.\n\nAll of that, and the Bridgegate investigation may not yet be over.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s miraculous, then, that Christie has managed to garner the support of 4 percent of likely Republican primary voters\u2014a number which places him behind Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Donald Trump.\n\nIf any of this worries him, though, he didn\u2019t show it during his performance.\n\nChristie walked onstage to \u201cWho Says You Can\u2019t Go Home,\u201d by Bon Jovi, who incidentally performed at a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton on Monday night in Red Bank, a riverfront town an hour south.\n\n\u201cYou get what I think, whether you like it or not or whether it makes you cringe every once in a while.\u201d\n\nChristie\u2019s campaign staffers said they were expecting 1,000 people to flood into the gymnasium, which is why, they claimed, the fire department made them remove the chairs that had been set up for the press. The room was at capacity by the time Christie got to the stage, but with what looked like just a few hundred supporters.\n\nThe first half of his speech was a slow, painstakingly detailed account of his family\u2019s history. The second half, a fast-paced glossing over of his record in New Jersey, a series of uneasy snipes at President Obama, odd metaphors and plenty of platitudes about Leadership and Working Together.\n\nAhead of the speech, Christie\u2019s team advertised the fact that unlike President Obama, he would not be using a Teleprompter to help him deliver his remarks, which might explain it.\n\n\u201cWe need strength and decision-making and authority back in the Oval Office,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is why, today, I am proud to announce my candidacy for the Republican nomination for President of the United States of America! And now, as Livingston and New Jersey turns its gaze to the rest of Americans, what do we see and what can we confront? We need a campaign of big ideas and hard truths and real opportunities.\u201d\n\nAt another point, Christie complained that other candidates won\u2019t try to fix entitlements because they claim \u201cif we do we will be lying and stealing from the American people.\u201d\n\nChristie said this was nonsense, because \u201cthe lying and stealing has already happened. The horse is out of the barn, and you can only get it back in by force.\u201d\n\nChristie, whose extent of foreign policy experience includes a trip to Mexico, a trip to England, and the declaration that Vladimir Putin would respect him more than he does Obama, bemoaned \u201cseven years of weak and feckless foreign policy run by Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nHe cautioned that the American people \u201cbetter not turn it over to his second mate, Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nAs Christie took credit for making New Jersey the better place that it almost certainly isn\u2019t, he promised \u201ca campaign without spin and without pandering or focus group tested answers.

She said she\u2019s an \u201canarcho-capitalist,\u201d someone who believes every government entity, from the library to the police department, should be privatized\u2014which didn\u2019t stop Paul from hiring her.\n\nvia Facebook\n\nIn fact, it was her outspoken persona that caught the eye of Paul\u2019s top aides. Copenhaver, I reported on Monday, told me that she first was contacted by Doug Stafford, Paul\u2019s top political adviser, about blogging for the campaign, but later explained to him that she believed she would be more beneficial to them working in a graphic-design and social-media capacity. (Stafford claims Copenhaver first contacted him about working on the campaign.) Copenhaver said she talks to Paul directly to \u201cdiscuss things that we want to do with social media.\u201d\n\nWhile inside the Peppermill, I watched as Copenhaver drafted a tweet on her iPhone from Paul\u2019s official account.

Listen up you stupid armchair jingoes, we (libertarians, constitutional conservatives, and anti-war dems) want nothing to do with your bullshit special interest fueled wars,\u2019 wrote Copenhaver in November 2013.\u201d\n\nOther Copenhaver posts referred to Sen. John McCain\u2019s \u201cblood lust,\u201d and offered a \u201cSide note: A big fuck you to Lindsey Graham and John McCain.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Copenhaver suggested that \u201cEdward Snowden deserves a Nobel Peace Prize NOT President Obama.\u201d\n\nIn an update to its story, the Free Beacon added that Copenhaver \u201calso opposed the Pledge of Allegiance because it was \u2018developed by Francis Bellamy, a socialist,\u2019 as a way to, \u2018sell more issues of [the] magazine Youth\u2019s Companion.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn response, The Washington Post\u2019s Jennifer Rubin\u2014who often pillories Paul\u2014wrote asking, \u201cWhy is it that [Paul] attracts people with these outlandish views? Well, for one thing Paul suggests that he might agree with some of them\u2026 one might expect that people who espouse the views Paul does and who traffic in smears attract people very far off the political spectrum.\u201d\n\nI asked Copenhaver how she felt about the media\u2019s reaction to her. In a text, she said, \u201cMy opinions are mine and not Senator Paul\u2019s. I don\u2019t speak for him, nor do I have any role in which I would ever speak for or advise him on policy\u2026 I don\u2019t think it is fair to have my old Facebook comments scrutinized by the media. Those comments were made long before I worked for Senator Paul. I\u2019m sure neither Graham nor McCain will lose any sleep over my comments but for what it\u2019s worth I am sorry. Regardless of my policy disagreements with them I certainly could have been more polite.\u201d\n\nStafford, distancing the senator from his latest hire, told The Daily Beast: \u201cI think if you are in your twenties, you grew up in a world where far too much of your life and your words are online. It\u2019s something that\u2019s never been dealt with before.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it fair? No, not really. Especially for someone who isn\u2019t in a job that involves policy or isn\u2019t a spokesman for the person in office or running for office.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose of us in politics ask often why people hold it in low regard, and also why more people don\u2019t enter into it. This little episode answers both of those questions if you look closely.\u201d\n\nvia Facebook\n\nAsked if Copenhaver would be fired, Stafford, who is from Long Island, texted: \u201cFire my graphic and web designer for old Facebook comments? Y\u2019all are more than a little crazy, you know that right?\u201d\n\nIt would be a crazy question, perhaps, if this weren\u2019t such a familiar predicament for Paul.\n\nIn 2013, The Free Beacon reported extensively about the musings of the \u201cSouthern Avenger\u201d\u2014the former radio personality/alter ego of Jack Hunter, Paul\u2019s then-director of new media and the co-author of his first book. During appearances as the Southern Avenger, Hunter, The Free Beacon reported, \u201coften wore a mask on which was printed a Confederate flag,\u201d and said in 2004 that John Wilkes Booth\u2019s heart was \u201cin the right place.\u201d\n\nHunter denounced his own comments, and Paul stood by him until he offered his resignation a week later. Hunter has since apologized for his indiscretions and now serves as editor of Rare.us, a libertarian website that champions Paul, although he maintains that his professional ties to the senator are permanently severed.\n\nAsked about Copenhaver, Hunter said in an email: \u201cThe neoconservatives are scared to death of Rand Paul right now, particularly his influence on the Republican foreign policy debate. They can either attack his views head-on or they can try to paint him as some sort of extremist using guilt by association\u2026 In bringing up extreme and embarrassing statements from my past, they drew blood. With this latest story, they embarrassed themselves. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be the last time, especially as they become more desperate.\u201d\n\nMy mentioning Hunter is not, I should note, meant to conflate praising Edward Snowden or denouncing John McCain with complimenting John Wilkes Booth, but to highlight the fact that Paul does, as Rubin contends, often find himself surrounded by \u201cfringe\u201d characters, and it has been and will likely continue to be a serious political problem for him.\n\nIn one sense, it does reflect poorly on the judgment of someone who is clearly running for president if he can\u2019t employ people wise enough to avoid hiring staffers who could pose an obvious political problem.\n\nConversely, shouldn\u2019t we, in 2015, be beyond this sort of thing? Barring instances when it\u2019s a communications professional who has said controversial things that reflect negatively on his or her boss, shouldn\u2019t we now expect that almost anyone working in almost any job has said something that could be viewed as objectionable by someone?\n\nIf the new rule is that you can\u2019t work on a campaign if you\u2019ve expressed an opinion on the Internet to which someone could object, all campaigns of the future will be staff-less and boring.\n\nBut maybe boring\u2019s not such a bad thing for wannabe presidents.\n\nCopenhaver is not, my conversations with her indicate, a loose cannon.

Trump has been joking for more than a decade that he would love to have Oprah Winfrey as his running mate.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019d do it, she\u2019d be fantastic,\u201d Trump said in 1999, when he was considering a presidential run on the Reform Party ticket. \u201cI mean, she\u2019s popular, she\u2019s brilliant, she\u2019s a wonderful woman.\u201d\n\nNow that Trump is\u2014legit\u2014the 2016 Republican front-runner, he\u2019s got some big names lining up to be his vice-presidential candidate. It\u2019s just that, so far, most of them happen to be 9/11 truthers.\n\nOn Thursday, Charlie Sheen tweeted out his supposed support for a Trump-Sheen ticket. (The 49-year-old actor was reacting to a recent Daily Beast interview with Owen Wilson, in which Wilson essentially dubbed Trump the Charlie Sheen of politics.) \u201cIf Trump will [have] me I\u2019d be his VP in a heartbeat!\u201d Sheen tweeted, with the hashtag \u201c#TrumpSheen16.\u201d\n\nAs Mediaite notes, it wasn\u2019t too long ago that Sheen was calling Trump \u201ca sad & silly homunculus,\u201d whose \u201cwords [are] as poignant as a sack of cat farts.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s entertain this Sheen-vice-presidency notion for a quick second. OK? Charlie Sheen has been repeatedly accused of violence against women. He jumped on the anti-vaccine celebrity bandwagon. And he, like Trump, has in the past expressed support for some liberal positions, including stricter gun laws.\n\nSheen is also one of America\u2019s most prominent 9/11 conspiracy theorists. He has been very upfront about this, and has no problem floating theories that George W. Bush facilitated 9/11.\n\nSheen isn\u2019t the only famous 9/11 truther who seems to be drawn to what Trump 2016 is selling. Conspiracy-uber-monger Alex Jones admitted that he agrees with roughly \u201c95% of what Donald Trump says.\u201d Earlier this month, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura declared the real-estate mogul the best pick for the GOP.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump were to ask me to be his running mate, I would give it very serious consideration because anything to break up the status quo of this country,\u201d Ventura told CBS\u2019s Minneapolis affiliate. \u201cThis country needs to be shaken up. It needs to be shaken to its very core, and Donald Trump is doing that.\u201d (The two are longtime friends, and Trump appeared at a Ventura campaign event in Minneapolis in January 2000.)\n\nVentura is passionate about many political issues, such as prosecuting Bush administration officials for torturing detainees, but his signature issue is investigating who REALLY carried out the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sheen\u2019s generous offer. (Sheen\u2019s rep hasn\u2019t gotten back to us, either, regarding his seriousness.) At the very least, Trump used to speak highly of Sheen, telling David Letterman in 2011 that the actor was \u201ca wonderful guy, I really like him a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit impressed with him,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen worse.\u201d\n\nNot the most resounding of endorsements, but far from a panning of his potential truther running mate.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:21.947+0000"}

Tom Harkin.\n\nErnst has been endorsed by Mitt Romney and former reality television star Sarah Palin, but in the event that that\u2019s not enough for voters, Ernst made an ad about her plans to use some unorthodox methods to get things done in D.C.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Joni Ernst,\u201d she sings in the friendly tone of a kindergarten teacher. In her next breath, Ernst gets straight to the point: \u201cI grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm, so when I get to Washington, I\u2019ll know how to cut pork.\u201d The ad then cuts to footage of a pig squealing.\n\nIn closing, Ernst dons the kind of smile usually reserved for toothpaste commercials as she says, \u201cI\u2019m Joni Ernst and I approve this message, because Washington\u2019s full of big spenders\u2014let\u2019s make \u2019em squeal.\u201d\n\nTurtle Soup\n\nTea Party Patriot\u2122 Dwayne Stovall was running for the U.S. Senate in Texas\u2019s March 4 Republican primary against incumbent John Cornyn (and infamous Hot Tub Partier Steve Stockman).\n\nStovall released an ad intended to slam Cornyn for voting \u201cto please a guy who looks and fights like a turtle\u201d (that\u2019d be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell).\n\nStovall, wearing denim-on-denim, sitting next to a large weapon on the back of a pickup truck, and stroking the head of a beautiful Golden Retriever like Redneck Dr. Evil, lectures Cornyn about how to vote (for Texas, duh).\n\nThe ad cuts to a picture of McConnell next to a cartoon turtle, and then to Stovall\u2019s adorable dog, who informs him, \u201cI like turtle soup.\u201d\n\nSomehow, Stovall lost the primary.\n\nElectile Dysfunction\n\nTea Party Patriot \u2122 J.D. Winteregg decided to challenge Speaker of the House John Boehner in Ohio\u2019s May 6 Republican primary.\n\nWinterergg, an adjunct French professor with zero political experience, released a commercial called \u201cElectile Dysfunction\u201d which underscored both his youth and inexperience.\n\n\u201cIf you have a Boehner lasting longer than 23 years, seek immediate medical attention,\u201d the ad\u2014which also mocked Boehner for his orange-hued skin\u2014advised.\n\nUnfortunately, Winteregg lost both the primary and his teaching job.\n\nGator\n\nRob Maness, another Tea Party Patriot \u2122 (endorsed, of course, by Palin) is running for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana\u2019s November jungle primary to unseat Democratic three-term incumbent, Mary Landrieu.\n\nManess released a slickly-produced, 30-second commercial where he wears cargo, shoots a gun, floats around a swamp on an airboat, and has his way with an alligator.\n\n\u201cHere in Louisiana, you learn to be tough,\u201d Maness informs. \u201cOne moment of weakness, and the alligators can eat you alive.\u201d\n\nManess is then shows tying a rope around an alligator\u2019s jaw. \u201cLouisiana needs a senator who will stand up to the career politicians, and the alligators.\u201d\n\nManess is polling at 4%.\n\nOutsider\n\nDavid Perdue is running a very competitive race for the U.S. Senate in Georgia\u2019s May 20 Republican primary.\n\nIn February, Perdue released a five-minute video that opens with him, wearing denim-on-denim (a popular look!) walking along a large field. Besides making it seem like becoming a successful businessman is as important as winning a war or discovering a new country, the ad depicts Perdue\u2019s opponents as babies.\n\nPerdue has actual babies in the ad, wearing white onesies labeled in red with his opponents\u2019 names\u2014he even put pearls on the baby meant to represent former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel.\n\n#GotBalls?\n\nLongshot Bob Quast is not going to win the election for the U.S. Senate in Iowa, but he should win something for this commercial.\n\nThe ad begins with Quast literally running. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Bob, and I am running,\u201d he says. \u201cRunning for Iowa\u2019s open seat in the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nQuast talks a bit about #TermLimits before the ad cuts to him serenely walking down the stairs in his home. \u201cIf you are the sexual predator and sociopath who murdered my sister Lynette, and you come to my front door to do harm to my girls, I\u2019m gonna use my Glock to blow your balls off,\u201d Quast says, as he takes out a gun and smiles, light twinkling on one of his teeth.\n\nThen, Quast brings up Joni Ernst, and takes out a knife to, I guess, remind voters about her castration skills.\n\n#winaDINO\n\nBob Quast soon returned with another commercial, this time promising to raffle off a free car in exchange for supporters signing up on his website.\n\nIn the back of a limo, wearing a plaid blazer, Quast raises his drink and says with a wink, \u201cyou stay classy, Iowa.\u201d\n\nYou too, Bob Quast.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:22.305+0000"}
{"entityId": 1919, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "A number of prominent conservatives seem convinced that Martin Luther King Jr. would have fought marriage equality. They are probably wrong.\n\nIn their fight against the Supreme Court\u2019s same-sex marriage decision, leading conservatives have been turning to an unlikely source for inspiration: Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d (PDF), the collection of notes that King smuggled out of his jail cell during his eight-day detention for protesting the Jim Crow laws that sanctioned discrimination across the South.\n\nThe letter is one of the most iconic documents from of the Civil Rights era and includes King\u2019s observations on the injustice of segregation and the daily humiliations that black men and women were suffering in their public and private lives.\n\nFast forward 50-plus years to Sunday morning when pastor-turned-presidential candidate Mike Huckabee referenced King as he decried the same-sex marriage ruling handed down last week as \u201cjudicial tyranny.\u201d Huckabee also predicted that Christians across the country would \u201cgo the way of Martin Luther King,\u201d and disobey the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that same-sex marriages must be legal in all 50 states.\n\n\u201cIn his brilliant essay, the letters from a Birmingham jail, [King] reminded us, based on what St. Augustine said, that an unjust law is no law at all,\u201d Huckabee during an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cAnd I do think that we\u2019re going to see a lot of pastors who will have to make this tough decision.\u201d\n\nDays earlier, the National Organization for Marriage, which has long opposed marriage equality, cited the same clause in a blistering take down of the Court\u2019s ruling, comparing it to the 1857 Dred Scott decision that declared slavery constitutional.\n\nAs the marriage question has wound its way through the courts, conservatives from Franklin Graham to Tom DeLay and Dr. James Dobson (PDF) used the same portion of King\u2019s letter to make the case that the Court\u2019s decision to expand the right to marry would be unjust and immoral.\n\nAnd when a group of Alabama pastors gave Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore an award this year to recognize his efforts to stop same-sex marriage, they called it the \u201cLetter from a Birmingham Jail Award.\u201d\n\n\u201cKing never said a law is immoral if it doesn\u2019t line up with the Bible. He would never have said anything like that.\u201d\n\nBut King experts say the basic premise of equating King\u2019s fight against segregation with moral objections to same-sex marriage doesn\u2019t ring true to King\u2019s broader message of inclusion, tolerance and the rights of minorities to live by the laws of the majority.\n\n\u201cKing never said a law is immoral if it doesn\u2019t line up with the Bible. He would never have said anything like that. That\u2019s not the way he thought,\u201d said Doug Shipman, the founding director of the National Center for Civil Rights and Human Rights. \u201cIf you look at the letter, morality is bringing people together, not separating them from each other. So it seems odd that King would draw an exclusive line someplace.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, it also seems odd that some cultural and religious conservatives are increasingly appropriating not just the language of the Civil Rights movement, but are also identifying themselves as an oppressed minority in a country that remains mostly white and mostly Christian.\n\nOn Sunday, Roy Moore warned Alabama churchgoers that they should prepare for their persecution. \u201cWelcome to the new world,\u201d he said.\n\nAt a protest to keep the Confederate flag flying on the statehouse grounds in Alabama over the weekend, a woman carried a sign that read \u201cSouthern Lives Matter,\u201d which spawned the Twitter meme #SouthernLivesMatter. It was exactly as ugly a cocktail as you\u2019d expect from a combination of race, Twitter, and a discussion of the merits and shortcomings of the Confederacy.\n\nAt the same rally, a Confederate flag supporter told the AP, \u201cRight now, this past week with everything that is going on, I feel very much like the Jews must have felt in the very beginning of the Nazi Germany takeover. I mean I do feel that way, like there is a concerted effort to wipe people like me out, to wipe out my heritage and to erase the truths of history.\u201d\n\nThose truths of history make it impossible to draw a straight line from American slavery to Nazi Germany to the Jim Crowe South to today\u2019s conservatives, who have seen social change sweep across the country in the last week and felt powerless to stop it.\n\nHistorically accurate or not, that lack of power, that sense of being a victim to current events, has become a key element of the new populism on the right that candidates like Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, and Scott Walker are trying to harness.\n\nThat explains Huckabee\u2019s and other conservatives\u2019 decision to graft the fight against gay marriage onto MLK\u2019s fight for Civil Rights. It also makes Ted Cruz\u2019s reaction to the marriage decision (telling an Iowa crowd that \u201cthe last 24 hours at the United States Supreme Court were among the darkest hours of our nation\u201d and hitting the \u201celites\u201d on the Court), make perfect sense. And it explains why Scott Walker would suggest a constitutional amendment on same-sex marriage that would be ratified by the states through a vote of the people.\n\nBy telling conservatives that their fight is as difficult and just and noble as those against slavery, segregation, and Nazism, the GOPers are not only endorsing conservatives\u2019 fight, they are also casting themselves as the next Lincoln, the next FDR, or the next MLK that history will require to overcome tyranny.\n\nWhen Huckabee quoted from King\u2019s letter on Sunday, it wasn\u2019t the first time. At the March for Marriage in front of the U.S. Capitol in 2014, he read lengthy passages of King\u2019s words from a white iPhone to the crowd that had gathered to protest same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cI wish I had penned those words,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cBut they were penned by someone who understood freedom, and understood that there was a time to stand up against law when it has become unjust. Those are the words that were penned in 1954 by Martin Luther King Jr. in his letter from the Birmingham Jail.\u201d\n\nAmong other omissions and inaccuracies, Huckabee botched the date King wrote the letter. It was in 1963.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:22.812+0000"}
{"entityId": 1920, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Like most liberals, I like our vice president. But this idea that he\u2019s some kind of white knight savior for Dems is more than a little far fetched.\n\nSeveral weeks before Maureen Dowd was feeding us dialogue from Beau Biden\u2019s deathbed, the chief promoter of a Joe Biden presidential candidacy was a fellow named Dick Harpootlian, the former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party. Here, for example, is a U.S. News piece from back in June, when Harpootlian was acting as a one-man p.r. machine for Biden. \u201cI think he was seriously considering it, but he was seriously distracted by Beau being in Walter Reed,\u201d Harpootlian is quoted as saying in that article. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything to convince me to say that it wasn't still something he was thinking about.\u201d\n\nIs Harpootlian driven by some quasi-mythic faith in la forza del Joe\u2019s destino? Maybe. But the record sure appears to reflect that he is also driven by an intense dislike of the Clintons. During the heated 2008 South Carolina primary, Harpootlian compared Bill Clinton to Lee Atwater. Now, that primary was far from Bill Clinton\u2019s finest hour. But Lee Atwater he ain\u2019t. Looks like there\u2019s a history there\u2014a history Democrats ought to be aware before the former chairman of a state where the Democratic Party has lost nearly everything it was mathematically possible to lose in the last generation becomes a major national power broker.\n\nLike most liberals, I like Joe Biden fine. He\u2019s mostly stood for good things over the years. Although it should be asked\u2014and will, if he enters the race, especially against a woman\u2014what percent of the responsibility he bears for the fact that Clarence Thomas sits on the Supreme Court. This is the story of Angela Wright, the former Thomas employee who had tales that corroborated Anita Hill\u2019s testimony but by bipartisan agreement (Biden chaired the Judiciary Committee at the time) was not allowed to testify. She spent a weekend in an Arlington motel waiting to be called, but never was. You might be hearing more about her.\n\nWait, I digress. What I meant to say was, generally, I like Biden fine and think he\u2019s been a steady and admirable public servant, and I\u2019m at a loss for words over the personal grief he\u2019s endured. I don\u2019t mind the famous malapropisms, for the most part; God knows Washington could use more people who depart from script on occasion.\n\nIt\u2019s no mystery why some Democrats are nervous about Hillary Clinton. But if they\u2019re thinking that Biden is some kind of white knight who can ride in and sort everything out, I would suggest they\u2019re mistaken. Biden has sought the presidency twice before. In 1988, he didn\u2019t even make it out of the starting blocks. Indeed he didn\u2019t even make it to 1988, because the revelation that he was cribbing autobiographical speech lines from British Labour leader Neil Kinnock chased him from the race in 1987.\n\nThen, in 2008, he rarely if ever got out of single digits. With a first tier comprised of Barack Obama, John Edwards, and Clinton, Biden never got out of the second tier. He finished fifth in Iowa with 0.9 percent of the vote and said sayonara that night.\n\nThat\u2019s not a track record that screams white knight to me. And every Democratic insider surely knows this. So what\u2019s going on here?\n\nIt seems clear that a little Clinton panic is going on, based on that one Quinnipiac poll that showed her losing to some Republicans in key states, and on the continuing Times jihad over her emails.\n\nThere are ways in which this is silly. That July 22 Q-poll looks increasingly aberrant, as legitimate polls have come out since showing Clinton with the same kind of 5- to 7-point leads over the first-tier Republicans that she\u2019s had for a year. As for the email story, that\u2019s a little less silly, as a political concern. No one has yet adduced any proof that Clinton did anything wrong, but that doesn\u2019t mean the Republicans aren\u2019t going to spend the next 15 months trying to suggest otherwise, and the proof-less suggestions have obviously done Clinton some damage in the last month. But panic? It seems a touch early for that.\n\nThe other point made in Biden\u2019s favor is the old \u201cpersonal affect-slash-authenticity\u201d argument\u2014that he displays a certain exuberance on the trail, while she is, to use a word I saw in the Times yesterday sourced to a \u201cprominent Democratic party official\u201d who may or may not be named Harpootlian, \u201cjoyless.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t mind the famous malapropisms, for the most part; God knows Washington could use more people who depart from script on occasion.\n\nWell, compared to Biden, yes, she is kind of joyless. Methodical and serious is how I would more charitably put it, but okay, fine, call it true. But again, in 2008, Democratic voters were given an opportunity to back either her grim earnestness or his joie de politique. Earnestness got 17 million votes, and joie captured 23. Not 23,000 or even 2,300; I mean 23 votes from Iowa caucus-goers. [UPDATE: This isn\u2019t quite right. I took these numbers from a New York Times vote summary, but it was weighted to reflect the number of state convention delegates each candidate would win based on the actual votes cast. It seems that Biden actually got a few hundred votes, but the 0.9 percentage is correct.]\n\nBelieve me, as the guy who wrote a book about her 2000 campaign, which I see you can now literally (to use a favorite Biden word) buy for as little as one penny (!), I\u2019ve probably written as many \u201cIf only Hillary could loosen up\u201d sentences as any journalist in America. But I have recognized, too, the sexism so clearly coded in the way many people say it. For God\u2019s sakes, Jeb Bush on the trail makes Clinton look like Sarah Silverman. But you don\u2019t see many \u201cWho Is Jeb, Really?\u201d stories. Men just aren\u2019t written about in that way.\n\nAnybody who has the means to run for president and wants to run ought to run. If Biden does get in and she beats him, well, that\u2019s one less woulda-shoulda-coulda hypothetical that will loom over Clinton. If he gets in and wins, well, he\u2019ll have earned it because by definition, the nominee is the person who earns it. But there\u2019s no reason to think Biden is some kind of rescuer. He\u2019s had two shots at this and has flamed out both times, and there must be a reason for that.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:23.297+0000"}

Moderators didn\u2019t let him get away with it.\n\nColorado\u2019s Senate race is one of the more hotly contested of the midterm cycle. The seat, in one of the nation\u2019s truly purple states, pits incumbent Democratic Senator Mark Udall against U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, a Republican, in one of the core five or six races that will likely determine who controls the legislature\u2019s upper house. Gardner, a rising star in his party that made his name bringing clean energy to the state, took the lead last month and currently leads by an average of three points. Meanwhile, Udall\u2019s approval ratings have sunk in lockstep with President Obama\u2019s this year, and his attempt to run what is essentially a one-issue campaign attacking Gardner on women\u2019s issues has largely faltered.\n\nThe race\u2019s first debate took place Wednesday night, and was as contentious as many expected. Few anticipated the moderators would take on as active a role as they did, fact-checking and pressing both candidates, often with three or four prompts, to answer a question.\n\nTheir part in the mayhem came to the fore on the topic of the Federal Life and Conception Act, better known as the \u201cPersonhood Amendment,\u201d which Gardner cosponsored in the House\u2019s last legislative session. He publicly renounced his support for the bill, which would ban abortions and certain types of contraception nationwide, in March, after Colorado voters overwhelmingly rejected a similar ballot measure in that state.\n\nSince then, he has repeatedly characterized the bill as a \u201cstatement that [he] support[s] life,\u201d and denied that it is a bill to end abortion. A moderator disputed this with the debate\u2019s most pointed challenge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to debate [whether the bill ends abortion] here tonight because it\u2019s a fact. Your cosponsors say so, your opponents say so, and independent fact checkers say so.\u201d Later on, he drove the point home: \u201cEveryone seems to have a cohesive idea of what this is with the exception of you.\u201d\n\nGardner\u2019s response was a familiar one.\n\n\u201cAgain, I do not support the personhood amendment, the bill you\u2019re referring to is simply a statement that I support life.\u201d This, and the fact that he \u201chas answered this question many times,\u201d were essentially his responses to the next four questions. His defense was bordering on farce by the time he attempted to compare his new stance to that of his opponent\u2019s on gay rights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll repeat the words of Senator Udall who said when he changed his position on the issue of gay marriage that a good faith change of position should be considered a virtue, not a vice.\u201d It sounds good, except that Rep. Gardner\u2019s change of position is not at all in good faith. As a moderator was keen to point out, his name remains on the bill as a sponsor. All that has changed is that he now refuses to acknowledge that the bill could actually become a law and have a profound impact on the lives of people both within and beyond Colorado\u2019s borders.\n\nThe episode does not seem to have made much of a splash in the race thus far. A Quinnipiac University survey of likely voters, out today, has Gardner at 47 percent and Udall at 41, after a Denver Post poll on Monday had Gardner up just two points.

Johnson amplified his dire predictions that afternoon before a gathering of the National Governors Association, saying: \u201c[A shutdown] means taking people off the front line and realigning their responsibility.\u201d Not to be outdone, the president issued his own warning in a session Monday before the National Governors Association. A partial government shutdown, he said, would end up suspending pay for more than 100,000 Homeland Security agents, which \u201cwill have a direct impact on America\u2019s national security because their hard work helps to keep us safe.\u201d\n\nAll very interesting, except what they\u2019re saying isn\u2019t true. According to figures from the brief government shutdown last year, the department has 231,117 employees, 31,295 of whom, or 13.5 percent, were furloughed. A closer examination reveals that all essential personnel would remain on the job, from Secret Service agents who protect the president to TSA screeners protecting us in airports and counterterrorism personnel. Looked at another way, 87 percent of Homeland Security personnel were deemed essential and remained at their posts during the last funding impasse between the White House and Congress. Eighty-seven percent.\n\nFor their part, the Pretorian Guard, otherwise known as the mainstream media, are failing to inform Americans that nearly 90 percent of Homeland Security employees will remain on the job protecting us from a variety of harms.\n\nSadly, there is something more at play here, something that has made the American people increasingly pessimistic about Obama\u2019s commitment to work with congressional majorities in the Congress to govern the country. After famously telling then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2009: \u201c\u2026Elections have consequences and Eric, I won,\u201d Obama is remarkably defiant in ignoring voters who sent overwhelming majorities in Congress to put the brakes on his efforts to fundamentally transform the country.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security will be fully funded save for the provisions Obama seeks to protect illegal immigrants.\n\nThe House passed a measure last month that fully funds the Department of Homeland Security at $39.7 billion\u2014a $400 million increase from last year. But the president has threatened to veto the bill, and efforts to move legislation in the Senate have been stalled by Obama\u2019s Democratic phalanx.\n\nThis standoff isn\u2019t about funding for the Department of Homeland Security but Republican language to prohibit Obama from providing funds to his executive actions that would allow some illegal immigrants to remain in the country and apply for work permits. Obama knows that once the executive actions are taken, the proverbial genie will be out of the bottle and nearly impossible to stop. Hence the doom and gloom messages of how Republicans are putting the country at risk\u2014all without telling the American people that the Department of Homeland Security will be fully funded save for the provisions Obama seeks to protect illegal immigrants.\n\nThe Constitution explicitly provides the Congress under Article I to enforce immigration and naturalization in the United States, but the former constitutional law lecturer adheres to his ideological fealty rather than the document he took an oath to protect and defend. Obama and his Democrat enablers are Chicken Littles predicting dire harm to the country when they know nothing is further than the truth.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:23.758+0000"}

And suddenly, Democrats are terrified\u2014terrified that the Benghazi panel is about to become the House Select Committee to take down Clinton, their presumptive presidential nominee.\n\n\n\n\u201cI did not want to believe it, but everything I\u2019ve seen so far has led me to believe that this is an effort to go after Hillary Clinton. Period. Clearly this has been a very much drawn out process,\u201d Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Benghazi committee, told The Daily Beast.\n\nTen months after its formation, the Benghazi investigation had seemed lifeless, at least to public eyes. The Benghazi committee\u2019s own investigation was moving slowly: just three hearings have been held, with two focusing on the State Department\u2019s role. And a House Intelligence Committee report found that there was no intelligence failure leading up to the 2012 attacks on U.S. facilities in Libya.\n\nBut with the emergence of a brewing scandal surrounding Clinton\u2019s private email communications, new life has been breathed into the investigation almost overnight. As Secretary of State, Clinton had exclusively used a private email account for government business, shielding her communications from the State Department and public records requests, The New York Times reported earlier this week.\n\nWithin days the Select Committee on Benghazi had issued subpoenas for Clinton communications that were relevant to Libya, including warnings to internet firms to protect relevant documents. Already, many of its previous document requests had been related to HIllary Clinton and the State Department.\n\n\n\nFollowing the Benghazi subpoenas, Clinton has called (via a tweet) for the release of relevant emails. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Benghazi Select Committee, praised the move.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence that the Secretary called for a \u2018stand down\u2019 order, interfered with requests for additional security or took any other action suggested by the conspiracy theorists. The quicker these emails can be made public, the sooner we can put these myths to rest once and for all,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nRepublican Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy has insisted he wants his investigation to be impartial, not to be partisan nor about Hillary Clinton personally. But the pull of conservatives clamoring for answers regarding the scandal has focused the committee\u2019s attention on the presumptive front-runner for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cWe have said from the beginning that our investigation would follow the facts wherever they lead us,\u201d Republican Rep. Peter Roskam, a member of the Benghazi committee, said Thursday.\n\nFor Roskam and other Republicans on the committee, the facts have led to Clinton. He was troubled by Clinton\u2019s use of private accounts during her time as head of the State Department, obscuring her communications from their investigation.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe last time we saw a high government official seeking to edit their own responses was President Nixon,\u201d he remarked.\n\nThe Obama administration is trying to drag out the investigation until Hillary Clinton announces a run for the presidency, and then delegitimize the Benghazi committee as being purely political, Republican Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, a committee member, said on Fox Business Thursday morning.\n\n\n\nBut with his next breath, Westmoreland seemed not to have a problem with it, telling the network, \"She owes more to the American people than just about Benghazi. This is about her actions for four years, having two personal e-mail accounts and not putting it on the State [Department networks], as required by law.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cI did not want to believe it, but everything I\u2019ve seen so far has led me to believe that this is an effort to go after Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nGowdy himself comes off as a reluctant Clinton adversary, having banked his reputation on an impartial investigation into the 2012 attacks. The chairman has been adamant that the committee avoid becoming a sideshow\u2014even as Democrats jeered its creation last year and criticized Republicans for spending taxpayer money on the effort.\n\n\"Speaker Boehner and the House tasked the Select Benghazi Committee with determining all the facts surrounding the Benghazi terrorist attack,\u201d Jamal Ware, a spokesman for the Benghazi Committee said. \u201cAs Chairman Gowdy has said, facts are not political. And this committee will go wherever the facts lead.\"\n\n\n\nThe majority side of the Benghazi committee has been largely tight-lipped. Until the Clinton subpoenas, there had been little public information coming out of the investigation from its small group of senior staff and lawmakers.\n\nThis information blackout is by design. Gowdy, a former prosecutor from South Carolina, has set the investigation up to run like a grand jury proceeding, according to people familiar with the committee\u2019s operation. That meant no leaks.\n\nAnd this largely worked until the Times report this week. Republicans on the committee insisted the leak did not come from their ranks, but it proved too relevant to ignore\u2014so they responded to it with subpoenas.\n\nFormer Ohio Rep. Steve LaTourette, who now leads the centrist-Republican Main Street Partnership, said Boehner deliberately selected Gowdy because of his reputation as deliberate, fair, and not prone to bomb throwing.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to be a partisan investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Gowdy was initially reluctant to take the job because of the highly, charged partisan nature of the debate.\n\n\u201cWe talked before he got the job. I was pushing him early on. I said, \u2018You know, you are doing something that in many ways is going to be a thankless job, but an important job,\u2019\u201d said the Republican senator. \u201cLast thing in the world he wants to do is to take a life well lived as a lawyer and people basically cash out on his fairness as a lawyer and as an investigator. You know, this is a charge that he\u2019s been given to find out everything within reason\u2014about what happened before, during, and after.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday the committee announced that it was in possession of records with two email addresses used by Hillary Clinton from when she in the Obama administration. The revelation, Republicans said, showed a worrying lack of transparency on the part of the former Secretary of State.\n\n\u201cI think [Gowdy has] had the right attitude about his job,\u201d said Graham, a critic of previous House investigation into Benghazi. \u201cHe\u2019s been able to find something that none of these other committees have found and that is, I think, very important for the country.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:24.028+0000"}
{"entityId": 1924, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "What\u2019s up with Clinton saying at that CNN town hall that kids crossing the border should be sent home? Believe me, Latino voters noticed.\n\nIf the bond between Hillary Clinton and Latinos could be boiled down to a relationship status update on Facebook, it would read: \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\nBoy, is it ever. And the relationship between the all-but-certain 2016 presidential candidate and America\u2019s largest minority\u2014and arguably its most important group of swing voters\u2014was made even more complicated recently when Clinton stampeded into the delicate immigration debate.\n\n\n\nIn an exchange that likely made many of her Latino supporters wince, Clinton wound up showing more sympathy toward President Obama for finding new and creative ways to deport 2 million people in five and a half years than she did toward the tens of thousands of Central American children who have, since 2011, streamed across the U.S.-Mexico border trying to escape gang violence back home and hoping to obtain the equivalent of Willie Wonka\u2019s golden ticket\u2014a permiso (permission slip) that allows the holder to remain in the United States. There is no such thing, of course, but the desperate tend to see things that aren\u2019t there.\n\nClinton would no doubt have preferred to avoid the entire mess, but the pressure of helping one\u2019s publisher earn back its advance tends to put people in situations where they have to do things they wouldn\u2019t normally do. In a desperate bid to help the lackluster sales of her new book, Hard Choices, for which she was reportedly paid as much as $14 million, Clinton agreed to be the centerpiece of a special CNN Town Hall graciously intended to promote the book. The moderator was CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour.\n\n\n\nIt was enough in 2008 for Clinton to regale Latinos on the stump with tales of how, more than 40 years ago, she spent the summer of 1972 in San Antonio where she registered Hispanic voters for George McGovern\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nAt one point, Francisco Gonzalez, a professor at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at John Hopkins University, took note of President Obama\u2019s record of removing undocumented immigrants en masse and splitting up families with such speed and efficiency that, as Gonzales acknowledged, many Hispanics now refer to Obama as the \u201cdeporter-in-chief.\u201d Gonzalez wanted to know what Clinton would do differently.\n\nThat was the softball lobbed over the plate, with the hope that Clinton would knock it out of the park by portraying herself as a kinder and gentler Democrat. Instead, she fouled out by trying to defend Obama and downplay the deportation crisis.\n\n\n\nClinton said that it was her understanding that \u201cthe numbers have been moderating in part as the Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement officials understood that separating children from families...is just not who we are as Americans.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat comment did not go over well with the immigration advocacy group, United We Dream, which released a statement saying that Clinton\u2019s remarks were \u201cat odds with the realities faced by too many of our families\u201d and demanding that Clinton pressure Obama to stop his deportation juggernaut.\n\n\n\nAccording to a 2012 study by the Pew Research Center\u2019s Hispanic Trends Project, about 1 in 4 Latinos know someone who has been deported. We have a front-row seat to the devastation visited upon immigrant communities by this administration. We don\u2019t see any \u201cmoderating\u201d in deportation figures. They continue to hover just below 400,000 per year, which\u2014according to a recent article in The New York Times\u2014is the predetermined \u201cquota\u201d that was set by the Department of Homeland Security in 2009.\n\n\n\nBesides knowing people who have been deported, I also know a dozen or so immigration lawyers who spend their days in immigration court trying to prevent clients from being deported. Nothing I hear from them suggests that the deportation figures are \u201cmoderating.\u201d Clinton obviously doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about.\n\n\n\nThat became very obvious when Amanpour asked her what she would do about unaccompanied minors who are coming across the U.S.-Mexico border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. At first, Clinton tried to duck the question by talking in generalities.\n\n\n\nFinally, after more prodding by Amanpour, Clinton said of the children, \u201cWell, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back. But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat about those cases where the child\u2019s family members live in the United States? Does Clinton expect us to separate them and send the child back across the border alone? Is this really the same woman who, after graduating from Yale Law School, went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund? Why won\u2019t she defend these children?\n\nHint: It has something to do with running for president. She needs every vote, and every campaign contribution she can get. And there are votes and contributions to be gotten from Americans who are fed up with border crashers\u2014even the pint-sized variety.\n\n\u201cWe have to send a clear message,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cJust because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay. So, we don't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking of encouragement, given those comments, a lot of Latinos who supported Clinton in 2008\u2014when she beat Barack Obama by a 2-to-1 margin with Latino voters\u2014are going to need some of it to vote for Clinton in 2016.\n\nIronically, before the town hall, she was in good shape with Latinos. Last year, a poll by Latino Decisions found that she had a 73 percent favorability rate with that group.\n\nIn fact, in 2008, Latinos were a cheap date for Clinton. They even overlooked her condescending remarks in a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas during the Nevada primary where\u2014in a desperate attempt to relate to Latino voters\u2014she suggested that all Americans are connected despite the fact that we divide groups by treating them \u201cas though one is guacamole and one is chips.\u201d\n\nWow. How did she know that\u2019s how we talk to one another?\n\n\n\nStill, it was enough for Clinton to regale Latinos on the stump with tales of how, more than 40 years ago, she spent the summer of 1972 in San Antonio where she registered Hispanic voters for George McGovern\u2019s presidential campaign. For Latinos, what clinched the deal was her last name. President Clinton was hugely popular with Latinos, earning about 61 percent of their vote in 1992 and 72 percent in 1996.\n\nYet Bill Clinton also approached the immigration issue like a hardline restrictionist, speeding up deportations, militarizing the U.S.-Mexico border south of San Diego with Operation Gatekeeper in 1994 and signing the dreadful Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which makes it easier to deport people and harder for them to return.\n\n\n\nLatino voters care about jobs, education, health care, and the economy just like other voters. But many also care about immigration, especially at moments like this when immigrants\u2014or, more accurately, in the case of Central Americans, refugees\u2014are under siege by everything from governmental inefficiency to militia groups amassing on the U.S.-Mexico border to fend off the child invasion.\n\nOn the immigration issue, the Clintons have never been part of solution. They\u2019ve been too busy being part of the problem.\n\nNow pass the chips and guacamole.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:24.799+0000"}

Engagement is the key to success in the fragmented media world of the 21st century\u2014it drives ratings, syndicated research scores and, the payoff, advertising dollars\u2014and part and parcel of engagement is fanning the flames over the most smoldering of stories. Consequently, we inevitably fall into \u201cThis used to be a great country\u201d moments, harkening back to a better time that may or may not have ever existed.\n\nLast Friday was a momentous day in American history as the Supreme Court of the United States upheld gay marriage as a constitutional right. It\u2019s easy to lose sight of it before being dragged headlong into the next news cycle.\n\nBut before you do, remember this: We as a country, over time, move ever forward. The arc of American progressivism, like the Dow Jones Index, goes through capricious whims both bull and bear, but we ultimately grow. We leap forward by yards, fall back by inches, and leap forward once more, eventually becoming, as President Obama said last Friday, \u201ca more perfect union.\u201d\n\nThink about it: 150 years ago, the Civil War ended, and with it went the odious institution of slavery, banned constitutionally through the 13th Amendment. Fifty-five years, later, in 1920, women, long denied the ballot, were given the right to vote. Less than a half a century forward came a complement of civil rights reform through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. We may have setbacks\u2014African Americans went from slavery into decades of indentured servitude, bigotry and systematic injustice; women suffered discrimination and further decades of second-class citizenry; voting rights are being challenged today, disproportionately affecting those people of color, and putting at risk the strides made 50 years ago this summer\u2014but we never go back completely to the way things were.\n\nOn Friday, June 26, 2015, after years of struggle and sacrifice, debate and dispute, polemics and pain, we leapt forward. This is part of who we are.\n\nHow many Americans today believe that slavery should be reinstated, or that women and people of color should be denied the right to vote, or that minorities shouldn\u2019t have the same access to public accommodations as whites? Though gay marriage is currently supported by 53 percent of Americans while 47 percent, primarily in C and D counties, oppose it, is there any doubt that half a century from now Americans will look back at a time when gay and lesbian Americans were denied the right to marry as unimaginable?\n\nAmericans, as diverse as we are, as divided and disparate as we can be, are united in timeless tenets that help define us as a people and as a nation: belief in egalitarian liberty, respect for the law, and a proclivity toward basic fairness. We saw that last Friday.\n\nSo, before we move on, before we get caught up in the controversies and tempests of another day, let\u2019s savor this moment. Let\u2019s remember it and fix it in our minds, just as we do the tragedies that inhabit our collective consciousness\u2014the Kennedy assassination, the Challenger disaster, 9/11.

But now it looks like his wife, Kathleen, might actually take the plunge.\n\n\u201cLast night, Kathleen decided she is going to take a serious look at running for the United States Congress from where we live in Maryland,\u201d Matthews told viewers of Thursday night\u2019s Hardball, his 7 p.m. political show. \u201cOur local congressman, a very good guy, by the way, just announced he is running for the U.S. Senate, and this development is all unfolding quickly.\u201d\n\nMatthews explained that he was discussing the prospect of his wife\u2019s candidacy on the air because \u201cit\u2019s important in my position here to be as transparent as possible with you, our loyal viewers.\u201d\n\nThursday night\u2019s disclosure was prompted by a report in Politico that Matthews\u2019s wife of nearly four decades\u2014a Marriott Corp. public relations executive and a local celebrity in her own right as a former longtime news anchor on WJLA-TV, Washington\u2019s ABC affiliate\u2014is \u201clikely\u201d to mount a campaign to replace Rep. Chris Van Hollen Jr. in the 2016 election cycle.\n\nThe seven-term Democratic congressman, who represents Maryland\u2019s 8th Congressional District in the affluent suburbs of the nation\u2019s capital, including Chevy Chase where Chris and Kathleen Matthews live, on Wednesday declared his candidacy for the Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Barbara Mikulski, who is retiring after 30 years in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve just got to deal with,\u201d Matthews told me Thursday morning when I reached him at home. \u201cI think people know who I am. I talk about Kathleen on the show all the time, and she\u2019s been on a good number of times\u2026I think viewers should have a heads-up from me about what I know\u2014so they\u2019re going to get it.\u201d\n\nIf Kathleen Matthews does decide to run, her campaign would likely create ethical complications for her outspoken husband, 69, who is also the author of seven books about politics and history.\n\n\u201cI know her commitment runs truly deep. In our nearly four decades together I have always had the strongest belief in her judgment and values.\u201d\n\nAddressing possible ethical issues, an MSNBC source told The Daily Beast: \u201cAs this process moves forward, if Kathleen decides to run for office, MSNBC and the Hardball Team would take all appropriate measures to ensure that coverage is transparent and fair, which would include fully disclosing Chris\u2019s relationship to Kathleen if her candidacy is mentioned either by him or a guest.\u201d\n\nThe MSNBC source added: \u201cChris doesn\u2019t cover individual congressional races too regularly, which is worth noting.\u201d\n\nThe question of campaign contributions would also be a potential sticky wicket. The NBC Universal News Group, of which MSNBC is a subsidiary, imposes strict rules on its anchors, who are generally prohibited from donating to political campaigns unless they receive prior approval.\n\nIn 2010, MSNBC personalities Keith Olbermann, a liberal Democrat, and Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman, were punished with two-day suspensions for writing checks to various candidates without permission.\n\nIn Matthews\u2019s case, he\u2019s sleeping with the prospective candidate, the mother of their three grown children, so it\u2019s reasonable to ask if he\u2019ll receive a marital exemption.\n\nThe MSNBC source referred me to the \u201call appropriate measures\u201d vow. After all, even if their bank accounts are not commingled and he doesn\u2019t max out in hard money, Matthews, if he\u2019s a decent spouse, will definitely be making \u201cin-kind\u201d contributions.\n\nA self-styled centrist Democrat, Matthews was a speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter and a top aide to Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill before joining the chattering classes as a columnist and Washington bureau chief for the San Francisco Examiner and later a television host and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of then-NBC executive Roger Ailes on the fledgling \u201cAmerica\u2019s Talking\u201d network, a forerunner to MNSBC.\n\n\u201cKathleen and I have not had much time to talk about it\u2014right now she\u2019s on business overseas, heading from Berlin to South Africa right now\u2014but I know she\u2019s been involved with public issues her entire career, from anchoring the news to serving as a top executive with Marriott,\u201d Matthews said on the air. \u201cI know her commitment runs truly deep.

But that doesn\u2019t mean she needs a real shift in strategy.\n\nSo now it\u2019s almost fall, and now, thanks to the most recent State email release, we know that Hillary Clinton apparently still believes in appointment TV (she wanted to know what time The Good Wife and Parks and Recreation were on) and that Lanny Davis does not employ the light touch.\n\nAnd oh yeah, we know her campaign is in trouble.

She\u2019s ducked an issue or two, like trade, but she\u2019s gone farther faster than almost anyone expected.\n\nAs for the enthusiasm thing, it seems to be a real problem. I talk to relatives who are Democrats. Yes, they say, I\u2019ll vote for her, but I\u2019m not exactly pumped up about it.\n\nBut very few people are paying much attention to this, because Clinton has these other two problems that can\u2019t yet be overcome with policy substance. The first of course is the emails. The second is a real, though often overstated by the media, enthusiasm problem. In the out-year autumn Phase II of her campaign, she needs to start changing some people\u2019s minds on these two matters.\n\nThe email story has already damaged her, there\u2019s no doubt of that. She has one big chance to turn the story around this fall\u2014when she testifies before the House \u201cBenghazi\u201d committee in October. That committee, now empanelled longer than Frank Church\u2019s intelligence reform committee in the 1970s\u2014an actually important committee that found out actually important things\u2014isn\u2019t even pretending to be about the Benghazi attacks anymore. It\u2019s a taxpayer-funded get-Clinton operation, and it\u2019s now all about finding a smoking gun in these emails.\n\nIf Clinton handles her testimony well, she can get more Americans to see what a fraud the committee is. For the past couple of months, the committee has receded into the background. The email story looks to most people, even really informed ones, like a skirmish between the Clinton campaign and the Justice Department. Most people haven\u2019t the slightest idea that the committee set this process in motion. If the committee becomes the issue again, then the email story can become not solely \u201cHillary is shifty\u201d but something with two layers: \u201cOK, Hillary may be shifty, but those guys are using taxpayer money to conduct an obviously partisan dirt-digging operation, and that\u2019s worse.\u201d\n\nAs for the enthusiasm thing, it seems to be a real problem. I talk to relatives who are Democrats. Yes, they say, I\u2019ll vote for her, but I\u2019m not exactly pumped up about it.\n\nThis kind of thing sorts itself out over time. Once she gets into a general-election race (if she does) against whatever Republican, and the GOP is selling buttons of her riding a broomstick and paying for robocalls saying that she wants to send your children to political education camps and all that madness, rank-and-file Democrats will have her back.\n\nBut she can\u2019t wait that long. She\u2019s running against a guy who\u2019s drawing crowds of 15,000 and more, crowds that right now she quite frankly can\u2019t draw. What effect would three more months of that\u2014Bernie Sanders speaking at basketball arenas, Clinton speaking at events the size of PTA meetings\u2014have on perceptions and poll numbers?\n\nThe Clinton campaign needs to do something to create the sense that there is in fact enthusiasm for her out there in the land. There surely is. But who are these Clinton enthusiasts? I\u2019d say the campaign needs to find some of them, and obviously they can\u2019t be just baby boomer white women, and put them in some YouTube ads to show the media and the rest of the country that yes, there are in fact citizens out there who actually can\u2019t wait for her to take the oath of office, a subset of people that no one inside the Beltway believes exists.\n\nNow, back to my question. Out of 40 head-to-head polls against 11 Republican candidates, Clinton trails in exactly two. There\u2019s one Fox poll from mid-August where Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio each lead her by two points. But 38 other times, she\u2019s ahead, and usually not by especially close margins. She\u2019s +9 on John Kasich and +8.8 on Donald Trump and +4.7 on Scott Walker. Only Bush and Rubio are close. That seems to me a pretty enviable position for a floundering campaign to be in.\n\nNevertheless, she isn\u2019t where she could be or should be. And my two maladies are related. She screwed up this email business in the first place by not using a state.gov email address, and it just gives too many supporters that \u201cOy, here we go again\u201d feeling. She has to reassure Democrats that if she\u2019s president, she\u2019s going to be smarter and more careful than that. This is I think the main thing Democrats want to know about her\u2014that she\u2019ll do her part to minimize the Clinton circus. When Democrats feel more persuaded of that, the enthusiasm will come.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:26.194+0000"}

But apparently the political activists in the Texas GOP know better.\n\nThe state\u2019s Republican Party has adopted into its 2014 platform a passage endorsing the practice, which, as marketed by the rapidly shrinking \u201cex-gay\u201d movement, seeks to \u201cconvert\u201d homosexuals into heterosexuals. The American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and a host of other professional bodies have condemned reparative therapy as damaging to the health of those people unfortunate enough to be subjected to its quack treatment regimens, which range from repeatedly beating a pillow with a tennis racket to \u201cprolonged hugs\u201d intended to let the recipient \u201cfeel the strength of another man\u201d\u2014in a totally non-sexual manner, of course.\n\nThe party\u2019s decision to insert such extreme language into its platform will have ripple effects far beyond the Lone Star State. Dallas is one of four cities left in the running to host the 2016 Republican National Convention, and as the gay-rights movement gains steam across the country, winning victories seemingly every day, choosing a state where the ruling party deems gays to be sick will send an divisive message. (In a sign of just how desperate the situation is for gay rights in Texas, one gay Republican told me that he considered the platform fight a draw because his colleagues were able to get the party to eliminate decades-old language declaring that \u201chomosexuality tears at the fabric of society.\u201d)\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly a surprise that the Texas Republican Party, one of the reddest of the red state party organizations in the country, would oppose gay marriage. After all, only a bare majority of Americans support it. But suggesting conversion therapy for gays, aside from being a bizarre preoccupation for a political party, is culturally tone-deaf on a massive scale.\n\nThat\u2019s primarily because the ex-gay movement, or what\u2019s left of it, is just a shell of its former self. Last year, Exodus International, at the time the largest ex-gay ministry in the world, dissolved. (The vast majority of such organizations are explicitly religious in tone, with only a handful, such as the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, attempting to maintain a veneer of pseudo-secular, psychiatric respectability.) Citing the untold \u201churt\u201d his organization had caused over a near 40-year run, former Exodus president Alan Chambers apologized to the countless men, women, girls, and boys who had been subjected to its message: \u201cThe opposite of homosexuality isn\u2019t heterosexuality. It\u2019s holiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Texas GOP resembles the George Wallace Democrats\u2019 response to racial equality in the 1960s, grabbing harder onto their bigotry based in the fear of America's growing inclusion.\u201d\n\nFor Rich Tafel, the news from Texas brings a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In 1998, Tafel was the leader of the Log Cabin Republicans, then and now the country\u2019s largest and most respected group representing gay GOP-ers. That year, some 50 members of its Texas chapter had been elected as delegates and alternates to the state convention, but the party refused the chapter an exhibition booth alongside other Republican and conservative groups\u2014the only organization to face such a ban. State party spokesman Robert Black went so far as to compare Log Cabin to the Ku Klux Klan and pedophiles, and slandered it as a \u201chate group.\u201d\n\nNot all Texas Republicans shared the views of the majority, and Log Cabin could count on some influential straight allies, foremost among them then-Gov. George W. Bush, who issued a statement opposing the organization\u2019s exclusion. \u201cWhile he differs with the Log Cabin Republicans on issues such as gay marriage, he does not condone name calling,\u201d Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said. Two years later, Texas Republicans would make national news again for their homophobia when, at the 2000 Republican National Convention that nominated Bush, some of them bowed their heads in silent prayer, holding their cowboy hats over their hearts, when openly gay Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-AZ) addressed the crowd\u2014about free trade.\n\n\u201cThe Texas GOP has been taken over by the most extreme elements in the GOP,\u201d Tafel told me this week. \u201cSixteen years ago, their behavior toward Log Cabin Republicans forced an apology from the state party director to Log Cabin. Today they have only moved further to the right and are so outside the norm of American society that the national party is too embarrassed to hold the national convention in Texas in 2016 because of this behavior.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s any \u201csickness\u201d in the debate over homosexuality, it\u2019s homophobia. A short documentary about the 1998 controversy, On the Front Lines, provides a chilling reminder of the virulence of its Texas strain. It depicts Tafel and a series of other courageous Log Cabin members addressing a \u201cRally for Liberty\u201d outside the convention hall as counter-protesters shout abuse and wave signs bearing slogans such as \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a Christian fag.\u201d One particularly angry man can be seen screaming: \u201cNever! Never! Never! You cannot have my son! You cannot have my daughter!\u201d Tafel, an ordained minister, calmly replies to the haters that their words and actions make him \u201cashamed as a Christian.\u201d And then, using the language of the pious against them, he declares, \u201cWe know that God is on our side.\u201d\n\nWhether or not there is a God, Tafel was right to be optimistic. Less than 20 years later, gay marriage, which barely registered on most people\u2019s minds at the time, is now a reality in states ranging from California to Iowa to Massachusetts. Gays can serve openly in the military. An openly gay man has just joined the NFL. The president of the United States has formally incorporated gay rights into his foreign policy agenda.\n\nBut as America moves forward, Texas Republicans remain mired in the past. The draft 2014 platform invokes a series of straw men, including the hoary old claim that legal equality for gays is tantamount to the creation of \u201cspecial legal entitlements or special status for homosexual behavior.\u201d It also condemns \u201ccriminal or civil penalties against those who oppose homosexuality out of faith, conviction, or belief in traditional values,\u201d as if the fearsome gay lobby is out to imprison ministers or pundits for their rhetoric.\n\nThe longer Texas Republicans keep acting like Neanderthals, the greater the chances that the politically unthinkable might happen. \u201cAs state after state embraces marriage equality, the Texas GOP resembles the George Wallace Democrats\u2019 response to racial equality in the 1960s, grabbing harder onto their bigotry based in the fear of America\u2019s growing inclusion,\u201d Tafel says. \u201cTheir right-wing bigotry is single-handedly doing what Democrats have been unable to do\u2014move Texas from a red state to a blue state.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:27.523+0000"}

The company pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal information in 2010. In its plea agreement with the Department of Justice, Balli Aviation agreed to pay a $2 million criminal fine, serve five years of corporate probation, and pay an additional $15 million in civil fines. The hefty sum was \u201ca direct consequence of the level of deception used to mislead investigators,\" Thomas Madigan, a top Justice Department official, said at the time.\n\nAlaghband is one of an array of questionable actors who\u2019ve been found in recent months to have given to the Clinton Foundation. The gifts\u2014from foreign governments with human-rights violations like Qatar, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and China, as well as FIFA, soccer\u2019s corrupt governing body\u2014have complicated Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign for president and raised questions as to whether these entities were trying to curry favor with the former Secretary of State.\n\nBut Alaghband stands out from the rest, because the beneficiary of his firm\u2019s deals with Tehran was an Iranian airline accused by the U.S. government of working with the regime\u2019s foreign intelligence operatives and shipping arms and troops to Syria. Plus, if an agreement between Iran and the world\u2019s major powers is concluded in the coming days\u2014as is widely expected\u2014operators like Alaghband could stand to benefit. Hillary Clinton will be put in the awkward position of either defending the act of the Obama administration in which she once served or criticizing the culmination of a U.S.-Iran rapprochement effort, which her State Department began.\n\nOne of the two counts against Balli Aviation was that it \u201cconspired to export three Boeing 747 aircraft from the United States to Iran,\u201d according to a Justice Department statement, without first obtaining the necessary export licenses from the U.S. government. The company then used its Armenian airline subsidiary to buy the 747s with financing obtained from Mahan Air, Iran\u2019s largest private airline, which is thought by the State Department to be controlled by former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, the Treasury Department sanctioned the airline for \u201cproviding financial, material and technological support to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF),\u201d or the expeditionary arm of the Islamic Republic's praetorian military division, now heavily active in both Syria and Iraq. At the time, the Treasury Department accused the Qods Force of \u201csecretly ferrying operatives, weapons and funds\u201d on Mahan flights.\n\nOn the Clinton Foundation website, Alaghband\u2019s company is listed as a donor in the $10,001 to $25,000 bracket. Moreover, on the website for Balli Real Estate, a property investment and development subsidiary also based in the UK, his personal bio describes him as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nThis affiliation, along with his donation to the Foundation, came as a surprise to Alaghband.\n\n\u201cI am not a member of the Clinton Global Initiative,\u201d he told The Daily Beast from London. \u201cI attended a few meetings. The last meeting was 10 years ago. I don\u2019t recall having ever made a contribution.\u201d Asked why he was listed as a member of the CGI on his own corporate website, he said: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this website recently. If attending a few meetings makes you a member, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nA source familiar with the Clinton Foundation told The Daily Beast that \u201cVahid Alaghband was never a member of CGI in a personal capacity.\u201d However, the source added, \u201cIn 2007, Balli Group paid a onetime CGI membership fee and they designated him as their delegate to the meeting.\u201d\n\nAlaghband did recall giving money to another influential organization\u2014the Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Brookings Institution. The donation he gave was to Brookings\u2019 former Middle East policy shop, the Saban Center, which had been named for its major benefactor, the Israeli billionaire Haim Saban. (Staunchly pro-Israel, Saban is also, coincidentally, an avowed supporter of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential ambitions.)\n\nIn 2007, Alaghband offered to give a $900,000 donation to run for three years to Brookings via the U.S.-based PARSA Foundation, \u201cthe first Persian community foundation in the U.S. and the leading Persian philanthropic institution practicing strategic philanthropy and promoting social entrepreneurship around the globe,\u201d as the foundation\u2019s website describes it.\n\nEmails obtained in the discovery process of a separate libel case show that Alaghband, who had already donated at least $50,000 to PARSA, initially intended to make a pass-through donation via the foundation to Brookings.\n\nBut Alaghband says that he never ultimately used PARSA as a conduit for his donation; instead, he made his contribution directly to the Saban Center. He says the amount given was \u201cfar less\u201d than $900,000 but declined to specify how much. Furthermore, he insisted, the money wasn\u2019t earmarked for any specific project or research use. \u201cOur donation went to the Saban Center and they had full discretion as to what to do with it,\u201d Alaghband said. \u201cMartin Indyk had discretion over the use of the funds.\u201d\n\nIndyk, who headed the Saban Center from 2002 to 2013, is today the vice president and director for foreign policy at Brookings. He also served\u2014 twice\u2014as U.S. ambassador to Israel under the Clinton administration. In 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry named Indyk the U.S. envoy to the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWhen we took the donation nobody knew there were any problems with Alaghband,\u201d David Nassar, the vice president of communications for Brookings, told The Daily Beast, speaking on behalf of the think tank. Nassar also specified that the donation came from Balli Group bank accounts, not from Alaghband\u2019s personal accounts. (Full disclosure: Daily Beast Executive Editor Noah Shachtman previously did work as a non-resident fellow in Brookings\u2019 foreign policy division.)\n\nAsked why he was listed as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative on his own corporate website, he said: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this website recently.\u201d\n\nA former Brookings staffer with direct knowledge of the donation told The Daily Beast that, on the contrary, Alaghband\u2019s problems with the U.S. government were known to the think tank at the time and that the money helped finance the work of Suzanne Maloney, a former State Department policy adviser and Republican advocate of U.S.-Iranian rapprochement.\n\n\n\nNassar told The Daily Beast that the suggestion that Alaghband\u2019s donation was intended to bolster Maloney\u2019s pro-rapprochement research was false. \u201cThe money was general funding for the Persian Gulf Initiative and not directed at any particular issue or any particular scholar,\u201d he said. Nevertheless, the Persian Gulf Initiative was a program run by the Saban Center and Maloney worked on it.\n\n\n\nMaloney is married to Ray Takeyh, an Iran scholar who served in the Obama White House in 2009 and who, during that period, was one of the lead advocates of engagement with Tehran.\n\nSince leaving the administration, Takeyh has emerged as a scathing critic of his former employer\u2019s nuclear diplomacy. But in 2008, Maloney and Takeyh jointly published a 34-page white paper with the Saban Center titled, \u201cPathway to Coexistence: A New U.S. Policy toward Iran.\u201d Arguing that the long-standing U.S. policy of containment \u201cis actually obsolete because Iran is no longer an expansionist power,\u201d they called not for a mere \u201cpolicy shift but for a paradigm change\u201d in Washington.\n\nIn many ways, the paper essentially forecasted the Obama administration\u2019s approach to dealing with Iran, from the largely hands-off approach to Iran\u2019s bloody 2009 Green Revolution to the present-day compromises on its nuclear program.\n\nAlaghband\u2019s legal troubles did not appear to affect his relationship with Brookings a year after Balli Aviation was hit by the U.S. Commerce Department with a temporary ban on his Iranian export business. In February 2009, he spoke at the U.S.-Islamic World Forum in Doha, where Brookings has another Middle East center, this one bankrolled by the Qatari government. The forum, in fact, was organized by the Saban Center on behalf of that government.\n\nAlaghband, for his part, insists that he did nothing wrong, despite his company\u2019s guilty plea.\n\n\u201cThe settlement [with the Justice Department] was one under which we did not have to accept liability. We just agreed to make a payment and settle out of court,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe had to establish a compliance program and do all of those things. The transactions we were engaged in was reviewed by and subject to a legal to a legal opinion both in the UK and U.S. about the compliance of with sanctions. We proceeded on this basis.\u201d\n\nThe settlement also represented the largest civil penalty ever imposed by the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security.\n\nPARSA\u2019s second-largest recipient of grants is the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), a Washington, D.C.-based lobby group close to the Iranian regime, which advocates an end to all U.S. sanctions on Iran. It received a total of $591,500 from the foundation. Alaghband\u2019s brother, Hassan Alaghband, who is also the CEO of the Balli Group, spoke at a conference organized in Tehran by one of NIAC's founders in June 2007, at which he spoke about Western companies doing business in Iran and cited Balli\u2019s client, Caterpillar, as a case study.\n\nThe Balli Group PLC had once been the world\u2019s second-largest steel trader but it declared bankruptcy in 2013. A major reason for its folding? U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\n-- with additional reporting by Jackie Kucinich", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:28.118+0000"}

The rug, valued at $3500 is on display in Brennan\u2019s office for official use only, was a gift from an undisclosed foreign country.

When Zandaakhuu Enkhbold, the Speaker of the Mongolian Parliament, visited the U.S. Capitol in 2013, he gave John Boehner a Mongolian Horse Head Fiddle. The fiddle is not made with a horse\u2019s head. Instead, the two stringed instrument gets its name because the scroll is traditionally carved in the shape of a horse\u2019s head. Boehner did not keep the traditional Mongolian fiddle valued at $850 and, instead, turned it over to the Clerk of the House of Representatives.\n\nAlthough its unclear for what official use that the Secretary of State would need to retain a sword for, he is able to keep the weapon, valued at $469, if he ever has to fight a duel against Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.\n\nScarf With A Obama Portrait\n\nHillary Clinton stepped down as Secretary of State in January 2013. But before the former First Lady left the Obama Administration, the Tanzanian Ambassador wanted to give her a token of esteem. So he gave her a scarf with a portrait of Obama, whom Clinton fought a prolonged Democratic presidential primary campaign against in 2007, between two illustrations of the African continent. The scarf was accompanied by a framed painting of Tanzanian birds and is valued at $595.\n\nWilkinson Sword\n\nUpon taking over as Clinton\u2019s successor, Secretary of State John Kerry received a Wilkinson Sword from William Hague, the British Foreign Minister at the time. The sword, which was held in a gold and blue sheath with a lion handle and had ER engraved on the hilt was actually \u201cretained for official use only.\u201d Although its unclear for what official use that the Secretary of State would need to retain a sword for, he is able to keep the weapon, valued at $469, if he ever has to fight a duel against Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.\n\nDVD About The 1992 Lithuanian Men\u2019s Basketball Team\n\nBarack Obama is the most famous basketball fan in the United States. But when he visited Lithuania in September 2013, President Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 wanted to remind him that her country was pretty good at the sport too. She gave Obama a DVD entitled The Other Dream Team about the Lithuanian men\u2019s basketball team in the 1992 Olympics which won the bronze medal against the U.S.\u2019s famous Dream Team. The DVD was accompanied by a personalized basketball jersey and a piece of polished amber. Together, they were valued at a combined $439.98.\n\nBottle of Sarajishvili Cognac\n\nRep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) received a bottle of Sarajishvili 20th Century Cognac from Irakli Garibashvili, Georgia\u2019s Minister for Internal Affairs. The cognac, an effort by the Georgian vintners to replicate the traditional French liquor, is valued at $1400 for a single bottle. Rohrabacher though did retain the bottle for official use in his Washington, D.C. office. Hopefully, he didn\u2019t retain it all in one sitting.\n\nPersonalized Honorary Storage Cubby For Moldovan Wine\n\nOn a December visit to Moldova where Secretary of State John Kerry sampled the country\u2019s wine, he also received a personalized honorary storage cubby at the Cricova Winery which contained 460 bottles of wine.

Bush\u2019s administration, because he had already \u201cvoted for same-sex marriage.\u201d\n\nDole went on to say that he couldn\u2019t see the connection between the two and pointed out that the senator in question had a gay son. This description can only match Portman, the Ohio Republican who opposed the treaty\u2019s ratification when it first came up for a vote in 2012. Portman verbally endorsed same-sex marriage after his son came out as gay in 2013.\n\nPortman\u2019s office pushed back against Dole\u2019s statement.

However, at the time, according to WKSU Radio in Ohio, he said he \u201cwould want to see some slight changes and then I would consider it\u2026as would a number of my other Republican colleagues who signed the letter as I did based on the fact that we believe that the Congress that duly elected ought to be making these decisions and not slipping it into a lame-duck session.\u201d\n\nDole\u2019s comments show the growing tensions within the Republican caucus about the treaty. Although the treaty is backed by establishment Republicans like Dole, John McCain, and George H.W. Bush, it has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre among social conservatives. Home-schooling advocates are especially opposed, as they +claim the treaty would cede \u201cour sovereignty, parental rights, and the rights of people with disabilities to unelected, unaccountable UN bureaucrats.\u201d The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the treaty on Tuesday by a 12-6 vote with all Democrats and two Republicans, McCain and John Barrasso, voting in favor.\n\nAs a treaty, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires the support of two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 votes.

But I cannot. Because I believe our very identity as an exceptional nation is at stake, and I can make a difference as president,\u201d Rubio told the crowd Monday evening as he announced his run.\n\nAlthough Bush\u2019s name was never mentioned, the comparison between the two Florida politicians is hard to miss.\n\nIn fact, Rubio\u2019s entire life story\u2014which he will not be shy about telling over the coming months\u2014stands in sharp contrast to Bush\u2019s upbringing.\n\nWhile Bush is the son and brother of presidents, as well as a member of one of America\u2019s most storied political families, Rubio\u2019s parents were a bartender and a maid.\n\n\u201cMost people who have ever lived were trapped by the circumstances of their birth, destined to live the life their parents had. But America is different. Here, we are the children and grandchildren of people who refused to accept this,\u201d Rubio told the crowd at Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower, built in the 1920s and now home to a memorial in honor of Cuban refugees.\n\n\u201cBefore us now is the opportunity to author the greatest chapter yet in the amazing story of America. We can\u2019t do that by going back to the leaders and ideas of the past. We must change the decisions we are making by changing the people who are making them,\u201d he continued.\n\nThis was no renegade Senate campaign, like the one Rubio launched in 2009 to defeat Charlie Crist and vault himself onto the national stage.\n\nIn front of a capacity crowd of some 1,000 supporters, Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign launch featured some of the glitz that his campaign six years ago lacked. Stars were projected onto the ceiling; tall American flags flanked ornate Corinthian columns from the front to the back of the room.

It was a sign that Bush\u2019s camp was anxiously settling into its GOP front-runner status.\n\nIn some ways it\u2019s always been a complicated relationship, with some insisting that the former governor was a mentor to the now-senator. But those who know them both play down their personal closeness\u2014or at least say it\u2019s impossible to know.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think even their most senior people understand that dynamic,\u201d said a Florida political operative with ties to both camps.\n\nSupporters, however, insisted that there was no direct competition between the two Floridians.\n\n\u201cMarco has always talked about American exceptionalism,\u201d said Rubio supporter and former Florida House majority leader Adam Hasner. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any direct attempt to distinguish himself from Jeb Bush. Marco is going to run his own campaign.\u201c\n\nFor Rubio, the setting of his presidential launch was important.\n\n\n\n\u201cI chose to make this announcement at the Freedom Tower because it is a symbol of our nation\u2019s identity as the land of opportunity,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIn this very room five decades ago, tens of thousands of Cuban exiles began their new lives in America. Their story is part of the larger story of the American miracle.\u201d\n\nThe son-of-an-immigrant approach doesn\u2019t always work with voters: Recall that Michael Dukakis, whose parents were both immigrants, lost big to Jeb Bush\u2019s father, George H.W. Bush.\n\nAnd in February, a Quinnipiac poll showed that Rubio trailed Bush among registered Republicans in Florida.\n\nBut Rubio sent a message with his campaign launch Monday evening: He\u2019s not waiting.

Outside, hundreds more waited patiently in a long line to enter; once inside, their voices were muted and the very young, holding a parent\u2019s hand, would be told about a brilliant, cloudless September morning when America changed forever.\n\nThis was the National September 11 Memorial Museum over the weekend, a place that documents our vulnerability as well as the nobility of so many among the dead. It is miles from St. Patrick\u2019s, and Saturday the distance between the two sites was quite congested, with about 25,000 marching along Sixth Avenue in orderly protest over the recent deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, two events that have also altered the country.\n\nThis was also the week when the United States Senate Intelligence Committee released an indictment that declared beyond doubt that the CIA tortured some captured during the war that began on that horrific September day 14 years ago. In all three locations\u2014the museum, the Fifth Avenue cathedral, the streets and sidewalks of the world\u2019s most famous city\u2014prayers for the souls of the departed resonated.\n\nSurrounding all of these places and hundreds of others you could see the season\u2019s lights brightening store windows and you could see the mobs of tourists pushing against each other to take pictures of the enormous tree standing in splendor above the ice rink at Rockefeller Center. Here, in the middle of the warped excess that is the heart of Fifth Avenue windows, there seemed to be no sadness and little memory of the defining event of our century.\n\nAt the memorial museum, it is the eyes of those taken by terror that speak softly, silently, to visitors. Portraits of most of the 2,977 victims on September 11 are displayed on the walls. They died for simply going to work that morning, killed by religious fanatics, homicide victims all.\n\nThe eyes of people like Thomas Patrick Cullen III, firefighter, Squad 41, husband, father, 31 years old. The eyes of Welles Crowther, the man in the red bandana, Boston College graduate, equities trader at Sandler O\u2019Neill. The eyes of Betty Ong, a flight attendant on American Airlines Flight 11, dead at 45, and the eyes of Amy Sweeney, another flight attendant on Flight 11, wife, mother of two, gone at 35. And so many more.\n\nWe have been at war for a long time and the fight promises to continue well into the future. We are a huge, complex, diverse country still offering freedom, opportunity and hope.

We can concoct all the false rationales available. We can construct excuses based on the evil that occurred September 11th. We can go back and forth about the unknowable: Was torture effective? And we can listen to the pathetic, creepy bravado of a former vice president, wrong on nearly every decision he made. But all of it cannot erase the fact that our country is a 250-year-old testament to ideals that became blasphemy in the hands of a few while the nation reeled in a fear ignited on a single morning in September.\n\nAnd if you want proof of what the country is really all about, just walk through the National September 11 Memorial Museum. Here it is, in the faces of the victims, in the stories of bravery, in the souls and memory of the survivors, the next of kin. The honored dead came from all over the world, from different lands, spoke different languages. They were rich, poor, black, white, brown, Asian, Hispanic, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Protestant. They were waiters, millionaires, stock brokers and salespeople, secretaries, firefighters, cops, young, old, their hopes, dreams, frustrations and futures incinerated by those who were and are twisted in their desire to destroy what all of us hold and too often take for granted.\n\nDuring the week I happened to see a movie, Unbroken. It\u2019s the film version of an incredible life splendidly captured in Laura Hillenbrand\u2019s bestseller about the staggering story of Louie Zamperini.\n\nHe was a young Army Air Force lieutenant whose plane crashed in the Pacific in May 1943. He spent 47 days on a raft and survived only to be captured by the Japanese. He then spent two and a half years in various prison camps in Japan. And he was tortured repeatedly, brutally, and mercilessly by his captors. And he survived again, returning from the barbarism of war and the obscenity administered by others to rebuild and live a life once shattered by the horrific reality of what human beings are capable of doing to each other.\n\nA couple of summers ago I sat with Zamperini at a ballgame at Fenway Park. He was a little guy, small in stature, but that was not who he really was because his heart, his being, his experiences, and the light in his eyes made you know he was actually the best of us: a believer in redemption, the future, the idea that we are all bit actors in the great American story where the strength of the country is stronger than any opposing force.\n\nZamperini died July 2. He was 97 years old. He lived through World War II, lived across all the decades in between, a time when we seemed to be constantly at war; the Cold War, Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, generations of battle.\n\nToo bad he is not still with us. I would have liked to hear what Louie Zamperini had to say in response to Dick Cheney\u2019s declaration that torture was OK with him, a vice president of the United States of America.\n\nFor more from Mike Barnicle, visit mikebarnicle.com.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:30.806+0000"}

For someone wanting to run for president next year, the decision is curious.\n\nFor a governor who is thinking about mounting a presidential campaign, mastering the art of emergency politics is an effective way to convince the general public that you have the managerial skills necessary to lead the nation in times of distress. You don't even have to do much, really, you just have to not make things visibly worse while speaking in an authoritative tone and looking concerned for the huddled masses. Oh, and you have to be there. Physically. Like, your body has to be in the state you govern.\n\nGiven how easy all of that sounds, it seems odd that Texas Governor Rick Perry would fail to cancel a scheduled trip to Europe as his state grapples with two ongoing cases of Ebola and several dozens of other potential cases. That and incompetence at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital may have caused the deadly disease to spread.\n\nPerry took off for England, Germany, Poland, and Ukraine for a \"economic development trip\" earlier this week, only cutting it short after a second case of Ebola was confirmed in Dallas on Tuesday night.\n\nTexas Democrats pounced on Perry's absence. Will Hailer, the Texas Democratic Party's executive director, called Perry \"an irresponsible leader who's not paying attention to Texas.\" Hailer dinged Perry for the fact that his schedule seems more about the GOP presidential primary that the crisis in Texas: \"An economic development trip two months before the end of your term, in between jet-setting to Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, clearly shows that this is a development trip for Perry.\"\n\nPerry spokesperson said in a statement to The Daily Beast he's not dodging.\n\nNone of this is to say that Perry was actually wrong to take the trip.\n\n\"Gov. Perry has consistently demonstrated leadership in times of crisis. This is no exception. He swiftly put a world class task force together to access and provide real time updates and recommendations,\" she said, referring to the 15-member task fore led by Texas A&M's Dr. Brett P. Giroir that was formed prior to Thomas Eric Duncan's death from the virus. \"He has remained in close contact with state and federal officials and cut his economic development trip short to return to Texas.\"\n\nPerry has himself criticized others for being absent from their posts.\n\nIn 2012, as a presidential candidate, Perry needled President Barack Obama for playing golf instead of working, as if to suggest that any time off at all could lead to disaster. In a fundraising pitch, his campaign manager asked donors to give $76, because Obama had played 76 rounds of golf since entering the White House.\n\n\"In honor of his prodigious gold habit, I ask you to donate $76 today \u2013\u2013 a dollar for each round of gold Obama has played since becoming president\u2026\" Later in the campaign, Perry gave a speech in which he used the trick again: \"Three and a half years, and nearly 100 rounds of golf into his presidency, Barack Obama. has exploded the federal debt\u2026.\"\n\nAnd Perry surely witnessed the public's overwhelmingly positive reaction to the opposite behavior while he was running for president, when Hurricane Sandy ravaged the East Coast, and New Jersey's Chris Christie used the disaster to give the political performance of a lifetime. It was a very different sort of crisis, sure, but Christie's presence shot his approval rating up, helping make him the frontrunner for the GOP nomination in 2016 until Bridgegate.\n\nNone of this is to say that Perry was actually wrong to take the trip, or that his very presence in the Lone Star State would've done anything at all to fix the Ebola crisis. But, having himself campaigned by hitting others for their lack of involvement, Perry obviously understands the optics of crisis.

Rand Paul\u2019s recent insistence that gay marriage \u201coffends myself and a lot of people\u201d serves as yet another reminder of the daunting challenge he will face on his way to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the entangling alliances he must forge. All eyes are on Iowa, where around 57 percent of caucus-goers are self-described born-again or evangelical Christians. And guess what? \u201cThe base of the GOP is still overwhelmingly pro-marriage,\u201d explains Steve Deace, a prominent Iowa Christian conservative radio host.\n\nRon Paul fell short of winning the state in 2012 with 21 percent of the vote, and it\u2019s worth noting the last two winners were Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, respectively. Paul\u2019s caucus calculus seems simple: Hold his dad\u2019s vote\u2014and add some additional Evangelical votes.\n\nThe problem lies with the more socially liberal libertarians and millennials that Paul hopes to court nationally. Keeping these disparate groups happy is sort of like trying to put a Rubik\u2019s Cube together. In wooing one bloc, Paul risks alienating another.\n\nHis positions aren\u2019t as inconsistent as they might appear. Unlike many libertarians, Paul has always been a fiscal and a social conservative. He differentiates himself from current GOP orthodoxy by stressing issues like ending military adventurism and domestic spying. But even here, Paul is finding it hard to keep everyone happy (see, for example, his joining with 46 other Republican hawks in signing an open letter to the \u201cleaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran\u201d\u2014a move some libertarians are questioning).\n\nThe more Paul is forced to speak out on positions, the more opportunities he has to turn off supporters. For example, David Boaz, executive vice president of the Cato Institute, and author of The Libertarian Mind, likes Paul\u2019s view of marriage as a contract, but suspects Paul\u2019s newfound rhetoric about gay marriage comes with a cost.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Boaz said, \u201cit\u2019s tone-deaf language that cuts against his goal of improving the image of the Republican Party with people who don\u2019t trust Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Boaz said, \u201cit\u2019s tone-deaf language that cuts against his goal of improving the image of the Republican Party with people who don\u2019t trust Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that the senator is being honest when he says finds gay marriage \u2018personally offensive,\u2019\u201d said Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of the libertarian Reason.com, in an email. \u201c[T]he important thing is that Rand Paul is not letting his personal beliefs dictate national policy,\u201d he said, pointing to examples where Paul has said government shouldn\u2019t be involved in marriage.\n\n\u201cMany libertarians, especially from the Ron Paul wing, give him a pass on this because he did say essentially that marriage should be a private contract,\u201d Boaz said. \u201cYounger libertarians in particular,\u201d he continued, \u201croll their eyes and declare \u2018Well, he\u2019s a conservative, what do you expect?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe conclusion seems to be that Ron Paul fans will stick with Rand no matter what, and although he may face stiff competition from the likes of Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum, and Ben Carson, the younger Paul might even be able to peel off some additional Christian conservative voters.\n\nIf he does that, he can win some GOP primaries. The problem, it seems, is with the always dubious notion that Paul could rebrand the Republican Party in the long run, making it more appealing to disaffected millennials and tech-savvy libertarian denizens of the Pacific Northwest. This was always the hopeful promise of a Paul candidacy\u2014the trade-off Republicans might accept in return for backing Paul.\n\nBut when push comes to shove, it\u2019s hard to imagine too many mind-numbed whippersnappers flocking to a candidate who says the kind of things Rand Paul will have to say to win in Iowa.

And yet, I will make a prediction to you now. Sanders will win one primary: Vermont. If I\u2019m proven correct he will have done exactly as well as another Vermonter, Howard Dean, who entered the primaries in 2004 positioning himself to the left of the major candidates. He forgot about the importance of field organizing, got chewed up in Iowa over a scream (unfairly so, actually), and after being the favorite for about two weeks in December 2003 went on to enter 31 primaries and win just the one, in his home state.\n\nWhat is it about Vermont? Is this just coincidence that Dean and now Sanders have emerged as the most prominent and credible left-flank candidates of recent times? Probably not.\n\nVermont\u2019s demographic changes in recent years, the way counter-cultural types have flocked to places like Burlington, are unique; neighboring New Hampshire is a very different place, and even Massachusetts, while liberal, features a different kind of liberalism, at once more blue-collar (think Fall River and Lowell) and more pointy-headed (all those universities). In a sense, what Texas is to the GOP, Vermont is to the Democrats: the party\u2019s ideological ground zero.\n\nThis is not of course to say that Sanders has anything in common with Ted Cruz beyond the fact that both are U.S. senators. For one thing, if Cruz is drawing crowds upwards of several hundred in Iowa, he\u2019s keeping it a pretty good secret. And the fact that he\u2019s not drawing such crowds reflects the most obvious difference between the two, namely that Cruz says lots of unpopular crazy extremist things, and Sanders is mostly just saying things that are probably a little out there in terms of the Washington conventional wisdom but are not in reality crazy at all, like reining in the power of big banks.\n\nSanders makes a great foil to Clinton because he is everything liberal activists believe (sometimes fairly, sometimes unfairly) she is not. He\u2019s blunt, she\u2019s circumspect. He doesn\u2019t care what anyone thinks, she\u2019s uber-cautious. On a debate stage with her and Martin O\u2019Malley, Sanders can just tee off and say exactly what the rank and file wants to hear in ways that neither Clinton nor the former Maryland governor can.\n\nLiberals love this because they don\u2019t get much of it in political life today. On the Republican side, the candidates fall over themselves to prove how conservative they are, and indeed the word \u201cconservative\u201d flies out of their mouths every 18 seconds. Democrats are usually terrified of speaking that bluntly, so when one does\u2014and Sanders isn\u2019t a Democrat, but let\u2019s not get technical\u2014liberals swoon. So he\u2019ll generate crowds and enthusiasm and he\u2019ll press Clinton on some issues. All to the good.\n\nHe probably won\u2019t have the money or the field operation\u2014hers, in Iowa, is already formidable\u2014to challenge her in a serious way. But the great unanswered question here is not about him, but about Clinton, to wit: How deep is the dissatisfaction with her among liberal Democrats?\n\nIf you follow the political pronouncements of the liberal activist class closely, you might think it\u2019s very deep indeed. The whole Draft Warren movement, led by MoveOn.org, is (or do we now say was?) predicated on the conviction that Clinton is certain to sell the liberal base out to Wall Street. One hears this a lot among insiders, and if this is a conviction that is widely shared by rank-and-file Democrats, then Sanders can certainly exceed my expectations.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get the misimpression that there\u2019s more rank-and-file resistance to Clinton among Democratic voters than there actually is.\n\nBut I just don\u2019t think the distrust runs that deep. I have before me here a Gallup poll from March showing that Clinton is rather popular among Democrats and the Democratic-leaners questioned in this surveyed. Her favorable-to-unfavorable rating was 79 to 13 percent, or a multiple of six. Sanders\u2019s numbers were 21 to 8. (Interestingly, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s were 37 to 9, a multiple of just four, and with a surprisingly high 53 percent having no opinion.)\n\nSeventy-nine to 13 isn\u2019t what I\u2019d call dissatisfaction. The key fact is that the 13 are overrepresented in the chattering class and among the most committed party activists. It\u2019s always been this way among the group we might call super-insiders, the people who blog and tweet and are willing to do things like drive 70 miles across the plains on a weeknight to go see an insurgent candidate whose realistic chance of becoming president is fractional.\n\nThe Clinton appeal to this set has always been limited. I can\u2019t pinpoint exactly why it is. For starters, the Clintons never curried their favor or flattered them. In her case, of course, a lot of it has to do with her support for the Iraq war (which Bill backed too, to the extent that his position mattered). More broadly, the Clintonian issues palette has never jibed very closely with the special passions of this plugged-in activist class I\u2019m talking about.\n\nTake for example net neutrality under Title II, which is of great interest to this group. Clinton endorsed net neutrality after Barack Obama made his announcement, but she\u2019s never been associated with the issue, and even in the act of endorsing Obama\u2019s position, she sounded pretty meh about the whole thing: \u201cAs I understand it, it\u2019s Title II with a lot of changes in it to avoid the worst of Title II regulation. It\u2019s a foot in the door ... but it\u2019s not the end of the discussion.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get the misimpression that there\u2019s more rank-and-file resistance to Clinton among Democratic voters than there actually is. And the press of course doesn\u2019t like her and wants a race. All this will work to Sanders\u2019s benefit. A significant number of Democrats may want to send Clinton a warning shot, keep her pivoting leftward; but the idea that there\u2019s a large bloc of Anybody But Hillary Democrats out there is just a fantasy.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:31.696+0000"}

Oh yes, it's feeding time, aka \u2018silly' season, again.\n\nThe political world is on tenterhooks waiting for Hillary Clinton, and when there\u2019s even a hint of chum in the water, the sharks come circling.\n\n\u201cClinton\u2019s Minyon In A Mess,\u201d declared the Republican National Committee. \u201cAnother Scandal Emerges From Clinton Land.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast\n\nMinyon refers to Minyon Moore, a longtime Democratic activist with ties to the Clintons, who also has alleged ties to Washington businessman Jeffrey Thompson, who just ratted out Washington DC Mayor Vincent Gray for allegedly asking him to fund an illegal shadow campaign to help elect Gray.\n\nIs that enough \u201callegedly\u201d to make your eyes glaze over?\n\nActually, it\u2019s just convoluted enough to set off the first IED (improvised explosive device) on Clinton\u2019s long and treacherous path to the Democratic presidential nomination. Rule One: Never let an attack go unanswered. American Bridge watchdog group, \u201cCorrect the Record,\u201d fired back immediately at The Washington Post, which headlined its story, \u201cHillary Clinton Adviser Minyon Moore Sought Funds for Illegal Campaign, Court Papers Allege.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cillegal\u201d was strongly contested by Correct the Record\u2019s Burns Strider, who called it \u201chorse sh\u2014t.\u201d The Dewey Square Group, the public affairs firm where Moore works, issued a statement saying Moore \u201cwas entirely unaware of any inappropriate activities\u201d and is cooperating with investigators. The public court papers in Thompson\u2019s plea agreement say he told federal prosecutors that Moore asked him to underwrite pro-Clinton efforts in four states and Puerto Rico during the \u201908 primaries for a total of $608,750.\n\nThe money was allegedly to fund \u201cstreet teams\u201d of grassroots people hired to put up signs and pass out literature\u2014what campaigns call \u201cfield work.\u201d There\u2019s no mention in the court papers of illegality, and prosecutors said there was nothing that indicated Clinton was aware of Moore\u2019s request. To get a better understanding of the dynamics behind these transactions, I spoke with a Democratic donor familiar with the nexus between money and politics.\n\n\u201cA lot of times in politics, staffers instruct and/or inform donors about ways they can be helpful beyond direct contributions,\u201d he says, choosing his words carefully, recalling a time when donors who had maxed out on their federal limits so a candidate could give unlimited funds to state parties; money that could then be funneled back to the candidate\u2014all done with a wink and a nod. \u201cThere are many legal and creative ways to help that go beyond direct contribution,\u201d he says. What\u2019s being reported about Moore\u2019s alleged dealings with Thompson are not surprising, or unusual, or illegal.\n\nWhat\u2019s being reported about Moore\u2019s alleged dealings with Thompson are not surprising, or unusual, or illegal.\n\n\u201cThis is batting practice for Hillary and the people around her,\u201d he says. The apparatus the Clintons have in place could be a bit rusty, so this dustup is a test run for bigger battles ahead. The Clintonites feel the Post over-wrote the story to suggest illegality by Moore, but say Strider\u2019s use of an epithet is not part of a get-tough-on-the-press strategy, but more a reflection of his long friendship with Moore, and a sense she had been wronged.\n\nMoore got her start in Chicago politics working with the Rev. Jesse Jackson on his presidential campaigns in 1984 and 1988. She has held a number of key jobs inside the Democratic National Committee, and has been the go-to person for national Democrats for more than 20 years on organizing and messaging in the African-American community. Moore has Clinton\u2019s ear and will have a major role in the 2016 campaign if Clinton runs as most of her intimates expect she will. Moore organized the first and only known 2016 briefing early last summer at Clinton\u2019s home in Washington to bring her up to date on the political landscape.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing in these court documents that could, or should, shake Clinton\u2019s confidence in Moore, but that won\u2019t stop the mudslinging. Moore\u2019s name also came up in papers related to a Federal Trade Commission investigation of Herbalife, a California-based diet-shake company, that critics charge is an illegal pyramid scheme.\n\nMoore met with African-American community leaders to warn them about Herbalife\u2019s get-rich-quick business model. Latinos and African-Americans are a significant portion of the company\u2019s marketing network. Dewey Square was hired to do the outreach to these communities by Global Strategies, another public affairs consulting firm.\n\nTheir appetite whetted by these revelations about Moore, hungry operatives are likely to dig more into the activities of Clinton alums, who have settled nicely into the city\u2019s public relations and lobbying infrastructure. Clinton\u2019s people expect many more charges and innuendoes will arise, and this week\u2019s rapid response shows the 2016 virtual war room is up and running.\n\n\u201cPolitical operatives and reporters grab at anything, that\u2019s the environment we\u2019re in,\u201d says a Democratic activist. \u201cEverybody wants 2016 to happen now.

That led to a blood clot forming between her brain and skull. The clot was treated and Clinton, with a clean bill of health, returned to her punishing schedule as our nation\u2019s top diplomat. And for most of us, that was all there was to it.\n\nOr was it? Yesterday at a conference, Republican strategist Karl Rove argued that Clinton may have brain damage. \u201cThirty days in the hospital? And when she reappears, she\u2019s wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury?\u201d Rove reportedly said. \u201cWe need to know what\u2019s up with that.\u201d\n\nEr, no, Mr. Rove. What America needs to know is what\u2019s up with your conspiracy theory-based fear mongering that is obviously intended to simultaneously highlight Clinton\u2019s age (old people slip and fall) and undermine her credibility as a female candidate (playing to sexist stereotypes that women are mentally unstable or simply less intelligent). Mr. Rove, you make these claims purely as conjecture without any facts, fanned by the emotions of your partisanship. If you weren\u2019t a guy, I might call you hysterical and paranoid.\n\nGeorge W. Bush had periodic episodes of alcohol abuse throughout his life leading up to running for President at age 54, including in 1976 when he was arrested for driving under the influence. There was also well-documented evidence that Bush had done cocaine during the same period.\n\nWhen Dick Cheney, at age 54, was Bush\u2019s running mate, he had suffered three heart attacks\u2014including on the year of the election \u2014 and had open heart surgery and a pacemaker installed. President Obama has written that, in his youth, he used marijuana and \u201cmaybe a little blow.\u201d Mitt Romney had 16 grandchildren when he ran for President in 2012 and two more were born during the campaign. Ronald Reagan was 69 when he was inaugurated President.\n\nThese were all by-and-large non-issues when these men ran for office\u2014certainly fodder for the opposition, but barely taken seriously and certainly not used to wage larger critiques on these candidates\u2019 character and qualifications. These were people who, whatever one thought of them, were obviously qualified for the offices they sought. A few behavioral or circumstantial dings weren\u2019t going to change that fact.\n\nNot so for the (maybe, possible) woman candidate who not only suffers the same slings and arrows aimed at her character but is constantly deflecting those attacks from impugning her fundamental ability to lead. If she chooses to run, Hillary Clinton faces a built-in uphill battle in a society that wonders if a woman is inherently equipped to be president\u2014sentiments given voice and legs by conservative commentators.\n\nAnd so while the similar realities of male candidates are basically left alone, the political chattering class endlessly debates whether Hillary Clinton, currently 66, is too old to be President or whether she would even want the job given that she\u2019s about to be a grandmother.\n\nWhen Dick Cheney had his fourth heart attack shortly after the Supreme Court made him vice president, followed soon after by a pacemaker and defibrillator being installed, I don\u2019t recall any serious political figures suggesting that Cheney was no longer qualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Then again, in our macho society amplified by the old boys club of politics, maybe having a heart simply isn\u2019t as important as having a brain. For politicians, that is. Both rational thought and decent humanity seem missing in so many political talking heads.\n\nWhich brings me back to Mr. Rove. In December 2012, Hillary Clinton spent four days in the hospital\u2014not 30. Mr. Rove should very simply and immediately apologize for this error and set the record straight. Moreover, experts made clear that the glasses Clinton wore after the accident were meant to treat double vision as a result of the accident and were not indicative of brain damage. Unless Mr. Rove has suddenly added ophthalmology to his resume of manipulating voters and freaking out on election night, he might want to apologize for this mistake as well.\n\nThen, at the very least, those attacking not only Hillary Clinton\u2019s qualifications but her fundamental chromosomal capacity to be president would at least be twisting facts as opposed to outright lying.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:33.070+0000"}

But what will 2016 voters think?\n\nIt has been more than a decade, but when David Riemer talks about Scott Walker, his voice still shakes with anger and exasperation.\n\n\u201cHe thinks that God is on his side and so that gives him the right to lie, to dodge, to make promises and not keep them,\u201d said Riemer, now a senior fellow a the Community Advocates Public Policy Institute, a think tank dedicated to reducing poverty in Wisconsin.\n\nBack in 2004, Riemer ran against Walker, then a first-term county executive of Milwaukee who had ridden into office on the back of a pension scandal, pledging that any of his office\u2019s hires would sign a waiver forgoing recently enacted lavish benefits and sweeteners.\n\nRiemer, an adviser to two Wisconsin governors and a former budget director of the city of Milwaukee, filed an open-records request in an effort find out if that promise had been kept. Turns out, it hadn\u2019t; in response to the open-records request, a handful of top staffers hastily added their name to a list stating that they had signed the waiver. The list didn\u2019t have a date on it, though, and wasn\u2019t an official waiver anyway, merely a piece of paper indicating that signatories had signed a wavier previously.\n\nIn a letter to the attorney general\u2019s office after the election, and after Walker\u2019s office had eventually complied with the open-records request, Riemer wrote that Walker\u2019s intention had been \u201cto fool me, as Mr. Walker\u2019s primary opponent in the political campaign for County Executive; to fool the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel; and to fool the voters and the public. The deception worked. We were all fooled.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general declined to prosecute but accused Walker of \u201cchicanery.\u201d\n\nAnd that was not all.\n\nIn the course of the campaign, Walker\u2019s team ran a radio ad accusing Riemer of engineering a pension settlement to a series of lawsuits that cost the county millions of dollars. In fact, the lawsuits predated Riemer\u2019s tenure with the county, and his reforms helped save the city up to $25 million a year. When pressed, according to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, Walker conceded that \u201cthe ad\u2019s assertion is not correct as stated,\u201d but he refused to stop running it.\n\n\u201cI have never in my life seen anything like it,\u201d Riemer, who ended up losing the election by nearly 15 percentage points, said. \u201cWhat kind of person admits that what they are doing is wrong but won\u2019t change it? There is a fundamental character flaw here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what a jerk he was. I was new to politics. I didn\u2019t think it was fair game for them to say anything about you whether it was provable or not.\u201d\n\nWalker is now on the cusp of announcing a run for president, and early polls show him as a front-runner to become the Republican nominee. And part of his appeal to the Republican faithful is his record of success in political campaigns and in public office. This is someone, after all, who won four consecutive terms in the state legislature before winning three county executive races in the Democratic-leaning Milwaukee County and three races for governor in blue-hued Wisconsin. He also became the first governor in American history to survive a recall. And unlike some Republicans in Democratic territory who hew to the center after Election Day, Walker tacked sharply to the right while in office, winning him plaudits from conservative leaders as a true believer.\n\nBut longtime Walker-watchers in Wisconsin say that behind Walker\u2019s success is a long record of bending campaign laws just to their breaking point.\n\n\u201cScott Walker is politics incarnate, with an unslakable thirst for political power and an eye on the next election,\u201d said Mike Browne, the deputy director of One Wisconsin Now, a liberal advocacy group. \u201cThroughout his nearly quarter-century career running for office, he\u2019s shown he\u2019ll do whatever he thinks he needs to do to win, letter or spirit of the laws be damned.\u201d\n\nMost notably, Walker has been ensnared in a pair of so-called John Doe investigations. In the first, while looking into missing funds from a veterans\u2019 charity run out of Walker\u2019s county executive office, investigators discovered that his staff had set up a secretive Internet system in his government office to allow them to do political work on the taxpayer\u2019s dime. Investigators also found that a railroad executive with business before the state had set up a straw donor scheme enabling his employees to donate to the future governor.\n\nThe investigation didn\u2019t touch Walker, but a deputy chief of staff was sentenced to six months in jail. Another was convicted of embezzlement after it was discovered that he used funds stolen from the veterans\u2019 charity to set up Walker for Governor campaign websites. Another top staffer received one year of probation and a $1,000 fine after cooperating with investigators.\n\nThe second John Doe investigation is ongoing and focuses on whether Walker\u2019s campaign illegally coordinated with the Club for Growth during his 2012 recall campaign. According to heavily redacted documents released last week, Walker\u2019s defense argues that such coordination was not illegal because Walker was not an official candidate until April of that year\u2014a mere two months before voters went to the polls and while Walker was raising and spending millions of dollars to ward off his Democratic opponent.\n\nWalker\u2019s trouble with campaign rules began even before he embarked on a political career in earnest. As a sophomore at Marquette University in Milwaukee, he lost a bid for student body president in a race that was marred by allegations that Walker improperly campaigned before officially registering his campaign, that he failed to properly register his campaign workers, and that he went door-to-door to hand out fliers in violation of campus policy. More seriously, after the school paper endorsed Walker\u2019s opponent, stacks of newspapers went missing, and the Walker operation was accused of engineering the theft.\n\nWalker dropped out of Marquette just before he was set to graduate and promptly mounted a campaign against Gwen Moore, a one-term state assemblywoman. In an interview, Moore, now a member of Congress, said her Republican colleagues at the time told her that the reason Walker was running was that even though the district was majority Democratic, \u201cthe majority voting-age population was white.\n\n\u201cHe would say his hero was Ronald Reagan. Lee Atwater, Ronald Reagan, that was the regime he looked up to, and he ran a perfect racial dog whistle campaign,\u201d Moore said.\n\nThe campaign literature, she recalled, featured \u201cguns, gangs, drugs, and urban unrest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cried,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I was being associated with the worst elements of the community. I couldn\u2019t believe what a jerk he was. I was new to politics. I didn\u2019t think it was fair game for them to say anything about you whether it was provable or not.\u201d\n\nWalker lost decisively, moved to a new district, and served nearly a decade in the legislature before running for county executive. While in office, he was repeatedly dogged by failures to properly file campaign finance reports, including leaving off the occupation of more than 50 donors who gave more than $100 in violation of state laws.\n\nFailure to list a donor\u2019s occupation is a problem that Walker\u2019s numerous campaigns have encountered frequently. When he first explored a run for governor in 2006, the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonpartisan watchdog group that pushes for clean elections, found that 114 donations totaling more than $75,000 failed to list the occupation or employer. In 2008, Walker\u2019s office stopped filing its campaign finance reports electronically, which made life harder for watchdogs, but still in 2009, One Wisconsin Now found that $170,000 worth of contributions were not listed properly, including two contributions of $10,000, the maximum amount allowed by law. The next year, the group found that more than $500,000 in contributions was improperly reported.\n\nIn 2005, two Democratic county supervisors filed an ethics complaint with the elections board against Walker for using his campaign arm, Friends of Scott Walker, to robo-call against them on behalf of his budget without disclosing who was beyond the calls.\n\nThe elections board ended up fining Walker $5,000, then the second-largest such fine in state history.\n\nBut it was not the first time Walker\u2019s name would appear before the state elections board. Since 2010, when he first began exploring a gubernatorial run in earnest, the state Democratic Party has filed seven ethics complaints against him.\n\nThe earliest cites a series of motorcycle rides Walker would take around the state while county executive, ostensibly to promote tourism to Milwaukee but which critics said was little more than a way for Walker to introduce himself to voters around the state (or beyond\u2014Walker twice traveled to Minnesota on his annual Harley ride and once to the early caucus state of Iowa).\n\nTwice the ride was sponsored by AirTran Airways, a low-cost air carrier that at the time had a request pending before the county commission for concourse space at the Milwaukee airport. The sponsorship led critics to accuse the candidate of extracting an in-kind donation from a corporation. According to the complaint, \u201cIt was not Milwaukee County logos\u2026that lavished and marked everyone of the three dozen stops on the tour. It was signs, flags and standards of Air Tran that dominated every single venue on Walker\u2019s tour.\u201d\n\nThe claim that the trip was just for Walker to promote Walker and not Milwaukee County was given credence, the complaint alleges, when in 2010 it was rescheduled to coincide with the date and location of the state Republican convention, allowing Walker to roar in to the convention on the back of his Harley. Plus, the complaint notes that Walker was accompanied by Tim Russell, a longtime Walker insider\u2014and the one who ended up going to prison for stealing from the veterans\u2019 charity\u2014who frequently moved between campaign and governmental positions. At the time of the 2010 ride, Russell was the administrator of the county\u2019s housing department.\n\n\u201cAny reasonable person would conclude that Housing has nothing to do with tourism\u2014Russell\u2019s presence indicates that the ride was in fact illegal campaign activity,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nAnother complaint alleges that right-wing outside groups like the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity were illegally coordinating with Walker\u2019s recall campaign. The CEO of one such group, the Bradley Foundation, was Walker\u2019s campaign chairman, and the chairman of the board of the MacIver Institute for Public Policy, a conservative think tank, had given $16,500 to Walker\u2019s various campaigns.\n\nA third complaint asks the Government Accountability Board to look into Walker\u2019s legal defense fund, one that he has poured $60,000 of his campaign money into, though state law says such funds can be used only for a candidate or public official who is being investigated or who has an agent who is being investigated. Walker has denied repeatedly that he is a target of the John Doe investigation.\n\nA fourth complaint alleges that in the spring of his recall campaign, in the wake of a federal Bureau of Labor Statistics release that showed that Wisconsin was the only state to post \u201cstatistically significant\u201d job losses in the previous 12 months, the Walker administration expedited the release of its own jobs figures, which used a different metric from the widely used BLS metric. Walker\u2019s numbers showed that the state added jobs, and moments after releasing the numbers, his recall campaign launched a blitz of television and radio ads touting them\u2014proof, the complaint alleges, of coordination between the government and political side of Walker\u2019s office.\n\nA fifth complaint, filed just this year, accuses Walker of dissembling when he claimed that his recent trip to the United Kingdom was for official business and used public funds to promote trade between Wisconsin and the U.K. The visit was widely seen as a chance for Walker to bolster his foreign policy credentials, and Walker refused to answer media questions while in the United Kingdom.\n\nAccording to a Democratic Party official, five of the complaints are still pending. Two more were dismissed. One alleged that Walker brought Republican super pollster Frank Luntz into the state capitol during the protests against the governor\u2019s efforts to end collective bargaining for public employees in the state. Another alleged that Walker tried to coordinate with the Koch brothers directly by discussing by phone how he was handling the protesters, including planting \u201ctroublemakers\u201d within their midst. (That call turned out to be a prank.)\n\n\u201cThe blatant disregard for campaign finance and ethics laws we\u2019ve seen from Scott Walker over the entirety of his career in elected office is unprecedented in Wisconsin politics,\u201d said Melissa Baldauff, communications director for the Wisconsin Democratic Party. \u201cNever before has a Wisconsin governor required a criminal defense fund, the donors to which still haven\u2019t been disclosed, or been alleged by prosecutors to be at the center of a nationwide \u2018criminal scheme.\u2019\"\n\nIn a statement, Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the governor, said, \u201cGovernor Walker has championed big, bold reforms that the left clearly doesn\u2019t like, but he\u2019s won three times in four years because of his results for the people of Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nFew in Wisconsin think Walker will somehow be brought down by any of the complaints. To the exasperation of state Democrats, none of these allegations seem to have much slowed his steady ascent through the political ranks. Now that he is running for president, Walker finds himself facing a new set of campaign finance regulations.\n\nIn a presidential campaign, many would-be candidates who are exploring a run take great pains not to admit that they are candidates for office. To do so would mean that they could run afoul of fundraising laws that forbid coordination between candidates and the outside groups supporting them. Jeb Bush, for example, has dismissed questions about what he would do as president by noting that he is not yet a candidate and wouldn\u2019t want to suddenly trigger a campaign. When he did acknowledge that he was running, Bush promptly backtracked.\n\nWalker has no such apparent qualms, referring to himself several times as \u201ca candidate\u201d and talking about how his sons may take time off from college to campaign with him, even though no such campaign officially exists.\n\nDemocrats have filed complaints to the Federal Election Commission.

{"entityId": 1941, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Obama\u2019s response to the Ebola outbreak will affect his legacy. But he\u2019s far from the first president to deal with such a crisis.\n\nThe government\u2019s response to Ebola\u2019s arrival in America has been rocky at best, with each new case raising legitimate questions about preparedness at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In true Washington fashion, a reporter asked White House press secretary Josh Ernest during the Tuesday briefing if the president still had confidence in his CDC chief, Dr. Tom Frieden.\n\nThe answer was yes, but with the likelihood of more Ebola cases developing and the midterm elections less than three weeks away, President Obama\u2019s handling of this public-health crisis could impact the midterms and become central to how he is looked at by historians. \u201cOne thing we can say presidents tend to be held responsible for responses to emergencies,\u201d says Bill Galston, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution.\n\nAnd for a president who hasn\u2019t always paid attention to the optics of his schedule, Obama moved quickly on Wednesday to cancel campaign events in New Jersey and Connecticut after word reached the White House that a second nurse had fallen ill with Ebola in Dallas. After hastily convening a meeting in the Cabinet Room with agency officials from across the government, Obama told reporters his administration will respond much more aggressively in the coming days, with the CDC dispatching a \u201cSWAT team\u201d within 24 hours to investigate each new case.\n\nPresidents have not always been seen as so central to public-health issues. The Spanish flu killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions worldwide when Woodrow Wilson was in the White House, but he escaped blame. \u201cIt was not a time when the political elites assumed the president should do something about it,\u201d says David Bennett, professor emeritus of history at Syracuse University. America was at war, and Wilson was asked to stop troop transfers to Europe to help contain the disease. Military commanders persuaded him the war took precedence.\n\n\u201cAmericans thought then we were at the cutting edge figuring out typhus and yellow fever,\u201d says Bennett. The Spanish flu was airborne and easily spread. State and local communities imposed quarantines, and Wilson himself contracted the virus at Versailles in 1919, when he was nearing the end of his second term. Still, there were no federal policies or presidential press conferences focused on the flu, and Wilson is still considered by many historians to be one of our better presidents.\n\nEbola has arrived when faith in government has collapsed. One way to restore that faith is to do something big, and to do it right.\n\n\u201cPeople didn\u2019t expect the government could do much about the disease apart from quarantine,\u201d says Jack Pitney, professor of government at Claremont-McKenna College. \u201cPeople\u2019s expectations about what government could do were limited.\u201d\n\nPolio peaked while President Eisenhower was in the White House, but the Salk vaccine changed everything when it was announced in 1954. Public swimming pools were re-opened and children once again could congregate without fear of getting paralytic poliomyelitis and ending up in an iron lung. Then Cutter Laboratories in Berkeley, California, made a bad batch of vaccine, and 40,000 children were sickened with polio. The surgeon general, Dr. Leonard Scheele, shut down the vaccination program and it took the personal intervention of the vaccine\u2019s creator, Dr. Jonas Salk, before it was reopened three weeks later.\n\nOveta Culp Hobby, named by Eisenhower to head the newly created Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the forerunner of today\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services, made the decision to approve the Salk vaccine for widespread distribution. Her resignation in 1955 after serving less than two years in the post was attributed in part to her not putting stringent enough safety measures in place.\n\nAs for the president, he was not defined by or damaged by what today would be seen as a major scandal. \u201cWe hired Eisenhower to run the Cold War, not administer shots,\u201d says Pitney. Hobby\u2019s reputation recovered as well, and Eisenhower even tried to get her to run for president in 1960.\n\nGerald Ford and the swine flu pandemic that never happened in 1976 is a cautionary tale that government action can backfire. Alarmed by an outbreak of severe flu among military recruits at Fort Dix, New Jersey, Ford mobilized a vaccine program to head off what he feared could be a repeat of the 1918 Spanish flu. Forty million Americans were inoculated, unnecessarily as it turned out. The strain of flu wasn\u2019t that lethal, and the shot left some 500 people with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a paralyzing nerve disease. Thirty people died.\n\nIt was a debacle, and it didn\u2019t help Ford in the 1976 election. But his pardon of Richard Nixon and his statement in a debate with Jimmy Carter about Poland not being under Soviet domination did a lot more damage than the swine flu.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan was in the White House, expectations for presidential involvement in pandemics had greatly increased, and he was criticized for being late to the issue of recognizing HIV/AIDS. He was saved by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who spoke out forcefully about the virus and the need for sex education in schools to promote the use of condoms as a way to combat the spread of AIDS\u2014positions that put him at odds with the conservative activists who had backed him.\n\nInitially derided by liberals, Koop became a leading voice on public health during the Reagan administration and beyond, and remains the gold standard of what a surgeon general can be in times of crisis.\n\nRemembering Koop brings us full circle to Obama and his surgeon general, a post that has gone unfilled for more than a year. Sen. Rand Paul, among others, is blocking confirmation of Dr. Vivek Murthy, a British-born American, because of his political views. He co-chaired Doctors for Obama, and once tweeted that guns are a health issue.\n\nAsked whether the absence of a surgeon general has hurt the government\u2019s response to Ebola, press secretary Josh Ernest said it would be a benefit if the administration had a \u201cdedicated public-health professional who was involved in helping us communicate with hospitals and medical professionals all across the country to ensure that these protocols\u2014the proper protocols\u2014were in place and closely followed.\u201d\n\nFor Obama, who took office saying in every crisis there is opportunity, Ebola has arrived when faith in government has collapsed. One way to restore that faith is to do something big, and to do it right. With or without a surgeon general, if Obama\u2019s response to Ebola is ultimately successful, it could be a powerful way of showing government can work, even when all else fails.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:34.018+0000"}

{"entityId": 1943, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "No one is invincible. If Republicans are smart about reaching out to young people and black voters, they can move back in to 1600.\n\nAssuming Hillary Clinton becomes the Democratic nominee for president, I offer you something that will defy conventional wisdom at first but will provide Republicans a significant opportunity to win next November if they play their cards right. There is a narrative in the media that Clinton is nearly invincible\u2014in fact some Republicans even want her to win! Consider the following exchange on MSNBC this week with veteran reporter Andrea Mitchell. Mitchell apparently has her finger on the pulse of Republican women, and she made this stunning declaration: There are many Republican women who secretly want to vote for Clinton and would do so without telling their husbands once they were safely inside the voting booth.\n\nOn air, Mitchell said: \u201cYou hear more and more anecdotally\u2026I know you do, I do from Republican suburban women who may not even tell their spouses or partners, but you hear of this longing for a woman in the Oval Office\u2026there really is a secret hidden vote there [for Clinton].\u201d\n\nI won\u2019t speculate about the social circles Mitchell hangs out with in her spare time, but I socialize with many Republicans, and I\u2019ve never had a wife tell me she secretly longed for Hillary to be in the Oval Office but wouldn\u2019t tell their husband of their intent to vote for her. Of course, I\u2019m a man, so I realize they might not tell me, at least if Mitchell\u2019s theory is right. Nevertheless, over the last few days I reached out to several prominent Republican women in media and politics to read them Mitchell\u2019s statement. I found the following illuminating.\n\nOne prominent woman in media told me: \u201cI would never, and know not one single female associate, friend or family member, who would vote for a female candidate based on their gender; whether it\u2019s Carly Fiorina, Hillary Clinton, Nikki Haley, or Elizabeth Warren. That is a sexist mindset, period.\u201d\n\nContinuing this line of thinking, a former colleague and fellow special assistant to George W. Bush offered: \u201cWhy would we vote for a woman just because she\u2019s a woman? The candidate\u2019s policy positions and record are far more important. That is as offensive as suggesting that you should have voted for President Obama only because he\u2019s black.\u201d\n\nIf there is a secret Republican women\u2019s vote that will help steer Secretary Clinton to the Oval Office, I\u2019m unaware of it. What I am aware of, however, is a significant chink in Clinton\u2019s armor of invincibility both to her nomination as the Democratic standard bearer and her winning the presidency: blacks and younger millennials. If Republicans play their cards correctly and make meaningful inroads with these two groups, the GOP could shock the media and the Democratic establishment (often one and the same) by winning next November.\n\nFirst, the Republican presidential wannabees would be wise to keep their finger on the pulse of the 18-29 age demographic that helped sweep President Obama into office. Clinton\u2019s support there continues to sag. Twice a year, the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government Institute of Politics, where I was a 2011 Resident Fellow, conducts a comprehensive poll to survey the mood of this key group.\n\nIn the most recent survey conducted last fall, support for President Obama and his policies continue to wane while interest in Republicans controlling Congress increased significantly over a similar poll conducted in the fall of 2010. For example, more than half of those students preferred that Republicans run Congress by 51 to 47 percent. That\u2019s a big change from 2010, when Democratic control was preferred by a margin of 55 to 43 percent. Not hard to extrapolate that these numbers for congressional support for younger voters could be even more stark for Democrats next November.\n\nMore ominously for Clinton, the poll showed a marked enthusiasm among likely young conservative voters to head to the polls and a lack of enthusiasm by younger Democrats.\n\nI make this statement from a position of knowledge rather than drawing inferences from the polling data. The students I have been privileged to teach both at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics as well as Georgetown have expressed to me their displeasure with the direction the country is headed. They are interested in traditional issues that favor Democrats such as climate change, same-sex marriage, and pay equality, each of which Clinton supports.\n\nHowever, Republicans can seize upon the slight crack in the door Democrats have provided: My students are also quite concerned with the size of the federal debt as well as the sense that President Obama has over-reached with his use of executive orders.\n\nMore ominously for Clinton, the latest Institute of Politics poll showed a marked enthusiasm among likely young conservative voters to head to the polls and a lack of enthusiasm by younger Democrats. Republicans would be wise to capitalize on the opportunity to engage these younger voters via social media\u2014the Harvard survey found this to be the preferred method of communications, with popularity shown on such platforms as Facebook and Snapchat with white voters and strong popularity with Twitter and Instagram among blacks.\n\nThe GOP field would also be wise to court a group of voters Clinton is likely to take for granted: African Americans. Phillip Klein wrote an interesting piece this week in the Washington Examiner in which he asked whether Clinton can hold together the Obama coalition. Blacks represent a huge opportunity for either party\u2019s standard bearer. As Klein notes, \u201cBetween the time of Jimmy Carter\u2019s victory over Gerald Ford and John Kerry\u2019s loss to George W. Bush in 2004, Democrats won black votes by an average of nearly 75 points. But Obama won the group by 91 points in 2008 and 87 points in 2012.\u201d Let\u2019s cut to the chase: If Republicans make significant inroads in the black community, they are likely to win\u2014regardless of their Democratic opponent. I would suggest they look to Ohio Governor John Kasich (my former boss), who won 86 out of 88 counties in Ohio in his 2014 reelection and wrapped up nearly 30 percent of the black vote.\n\nFinally, let me address the invincibility factor of Clinton\u2019s candidacy. Yes, the electoral college map seems to favor the putative Democratic nominee at this point. But recent polling by Dr. Ron Faucheux from the Clarus Research Group should be sending warning bells to Clinton.\n\nIn polling data released last week, Clinton is either tied or behind a handful of her potential Republican challengers. In Colorado, Faucheux found Clinton and former Governor Mike Huckabee tied with 41 percent each, while Marco Rubio and Scott Walker were edging Clinton by one point.\n\nThe same basic point holds for Clinton in Iowa. The point is that in key states such as Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia\u2014states Clinton needs to win to head back to the White House\u2014her approval ratings are less than 50 percent across the board. Should Republicans win these states along with Ohio and Florida, I don\u2019t see a viable path for a Clinton victory.\n\nDespite the cheerleading in the media and academia thus far, Hillary Clinton can be beaten in her quest to return the Clintons to the White House. Actions speak louder than words, and the time is now for Republicans to actively court groups previously ceded to the Democrats as both sides look to carve out 270 electoral college votes to win the presidency. Will the Republicans fight for votes with people of color and younger voters to get it right this time? Only time can tell but the bloom is off the rose of Clinton\u2019s inevitable march to the presidency.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:34.611+0000"}

Forbes estimates that he\u2019s worth less than half that much, around $4 billion. Does it matter? The answer is definitively no, because once the Donald Trump presidential charade is over he\u2019s gonna be worth much more than $8 billion\u2014and worth every penny of it.\n\nI have to say up front I\u2019ve known Trump for years and I like him even if much of his presidential announcement speech had my skin crawling. (Describing many Mexican immigrants as \u201crapists\u201d is at the top of my list.) But I have long appreciated Trump\u2019s resilience both in business and in his personal life; anyone who remembers the early 1990s vintage Trump, when he was both mocked as a business has-been and was by some estimates insolvent, also knows that more recently his name and brand keeps getting bigger and his wives keep getting hotter.\n\nAll of which leads me to believe that this man\u2014who needs to brag about his wealth and intelligence like most people need to breathe\u2014is looking at this presidential thing like he looks at everything else: how to make a brand that\u2019s big and profitable even more so.\n\nFor the record, I don\u2019t know how much Donald Trump is worth, and in the past he has been touchy when reporters have challenged his fortune\u2019s size. (He sued one reporter who quoted unnamed sources saying Trump was merely worth hundreds of millions instead of billions for libel. In 2011, a New Jersey appellate judge dismissed the case, saying Trump failed to prove \u201cactual malice.\u201d)\n\nEven so, every Wall Street firm I covered wanted Trump\u2019s business as he pulled himself back from his near-death experience in the early 1990s, when some of his Atlantic City properties filed for bankruptcy. Trump himself never filed for bankruptcy, which is probably why, as he began to rebuild himself, his Wall Street broker was none other than the late Alan \u201cAce\u201d Greenberg, the legendary stock trader who only handled accounts of the megawealthy.\n\nDonald Trump isn\u2019t really running for president; he\u2019s running to make more money and enhance a brand that\u2019s bigger than his real-estate holdings and golf courses.\n\nTo be sure, in his announcement speech Trump offered scant evidence that he\u2019s worth what he says he is; indeed, he has just filed the standard forms with the Federal Election Commission, which will start a more-intensive vetting process over his financial disclosures.\n\nThose forms are pretty exhaustive, I might add; just go to the website of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and take a look at what candidates need to disclose and you\u2019ll understand why rich people generally don\u2019t run for president. Candidates are required to disclose, in detail, assets and income, then transactions and gifts and travel reimbursements. Another layer of detail involves disclosing liabilities and something called \u201cagreements or arrangements.\u201d\n\nLastly, presidential candidates must disclose \u201cpositions (other than with the U.S. government)\u201d and \u201csources of income in excess of $5,000.\u201d This is why Karl Rove said on Fox News Sunday that other candidates should \u201cignore\u201d Trump until he files with the FEC, which he did late Monday afternoon.\n\nTrump fired back on Twitter: \u201c@KarlRove still thinks Romney won! He doesn\u2019t have a clue! @FoxNews,\u201d and in another he vowed to make his initial financial disclosures this week: \u201c@KarlRove, who spent $430 million in the last cycle and didn\u2019t win one race, said I\u2019m not a candidate until I file papers. Next week Karl!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign manager told me that the full disclosure will be completed in 30 days; Trump, he said, won\u2019t seek extensions as Rove and others have predicted.\n\nWe shall see. In any event, like Rove, I had my doubts that Trump would go through with the whole disclosure process. What I never doubted is that he loves the attention because the debate over the net worth of the new and improved Donald Trump no longer turns on the vagaries of the real-estate market but on the value of his brand.\n\nKeep in mind much of the difference between the Forbes net worth estimate and Trump\u2019s own, which he says was compiled by \u201chighly respected\u201d accountants, is the value of the Trump brand, which Forbes says isn\u2019t worth the $3 billion-plus Trump says it is.\n\nBut how do you really value a brand? Brands are worth what people think they\u2019re worth, and when you\u2019re name is everywhere from hotels and apartments buildings to reality TV, it\u2019s easy to see how the numbers add up and will keep adding up as he does this presidential dance that, quite frankly, is amazing reality television.\n\nThat\u2019s why I have no doubt that Trump will turn this new \u201cserious\u201d stage of his life into a business winner. The way I see it, Donald Trump isn\u2019t really running for president; he\u2019s running to make more money and enhance a brand that\u2019s bigger than his real-estate holdings and golf courses. And with the people who matter to him the most, it doesn\u2019t get cheapened by occasionally disgusting rhetoric about immigrants or possible exaggerations about his wealth.\n\nHe\u2019s playing to his fans and there are many millions of them. They like him on television and they like his real estate and golf courses. Another bet: I don\u2019t think Donald will run for president after all, regardless of Monday\u2019s FEC filing, or even if he does make those detailed financial disclosures and somehow gins up enough publicity to get into the first GOP debate in August.\n\nIn the end, I think he will call it quits because, after awhile, Donald is going to realize he\u2019s squeezed all the marketing juice out of the presidential lemon that is possible, and anything more will end up hurting, not helping, one of the world\u2019s great brands.\n\nHe knows that, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s so rich.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:34.876+0000"}
{"entityId": 1945, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Increasingly, GOP Senate hopes hinge on Kansas. And, increasingly, incumbent Republican Pat Roberts is becoming more and more unhinged.\n\nWeren\u2019t politicians supposed to agree that invoking Hitler is usually a bad idea? Somebody better remind Pat Roberts, the Kansas senator on whom the GOP\u2019s hopes of taking over the Senate increasingly depend, that that\u2019s the general bargain. Because lately, the evermore desperate incumbent is going around the Jayhawk State saying things like this:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a palpable fear among Kansans all across the state that the America that we love and cherish will not be the same America for our kids and grandkids, and that\u2019s wrong. One of the reasons that I\u2019m running is to change that. There\u2019s an easy way to do it. I\u2019ll let you figure it out. But at any rate, we have to change course because our country is headed for national socialism. That\u2019s not right. It\u2019s changing our culture. It\u2019s changing what we\u2019re all about.\u201d\n\nAll right, no explicit Hitler mention. But...national socialism? We\u2019ve all heard Obama equals socialism until it\u2019s coming out our ears. But national socialism? That\u2019s Nazism. The National Socialist Democratic Workers\u2019 Party, in case you\u2019d forgotten. And there was only one. Benito Mussolini came out of the more straightforwardly named National Fascist Party. Japan had something called the Imperial Rule Assistance Association.\n\nBut only Hitler\u2019s Germany had a national socialist party (well, also certain successor offshoots, as in Hungary). So it\u2019s pretty clear what Roberts is saying here. He would deny it, of course, if Kansas reporters tried to ask him. But denying it would be like giving a speech that makes reference to gruesome murders by repeated stabbing and using victims\u2019 blood to write \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d on the walls and then saying goodness no, whatever gave you the idea that I was referring to Charles Manson?\n\nThis is not okay. But I would suspect Roberts is going to get away with it, because Greg Orman, the independent challenger who is lately running ahead of him, is not going to stand up in the state of Kansas a few weeks before Election Day and defend Barack Obama on anything, even an oblique-but-clear Hitler comparison.\n\nThe more one studies Roberts, the more one concludes that he is the kind of fellow that former Nebraska Senator Roman Hruska had in mind when he famously quipped that mediocre people are entitled to a little representation, too. Mediocre at best, malevolent at worst. It interests me that he\u2019s lately trotted out old Bob Dole to campaign with him. Dole, coming as he does from an earlier time and now a defanged nonagenarian, represents a degree of old-school moderation at this point in his life, so by appearing with Dole while making references to national socialism, Roberts can cleverly have it both ways. But I hope enough Kansans remember what Roberts did to Dole when the latter was counting on him most.\n\nDole, who suffered a crippling injury in the Big War, had been one of the leading sponsors of the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990. He always called it a proud moment. Fast-forward to late 2012, when the Senate was considering approval of an international treaty designed to spur other nations to emulate the United States\u2019 groundbreaking law. Dole was its most famous spokesman. On December 4, 2012, the now-wheelchair-bound ex-senator rolled himself onto the floor of the old chamber to pigeonhole his former colleagues. A heart-rending scene. How could he lose?\n\n\u201cThe only other time in his career that Washington took much notice of Roberts came during the Iraq War, when he walked point for the Bushies in bottling up for more than two years a report on how the administration misused pre-war intelligence.\u201d\n\nWell, one way he could lose was for his old friend Roberts, who was in the House while Dole was in the Senate, to vote against him, which Roberts did. In fact both Kansas senators did\u2014Jerry Moran\u2019s betrayal was even worse, since Moran had committed to the measure publicly, which Roberts hadn\u2019t. The right-wing lobbying machinery got cranked up and warned God-fearing Americans that approval of this treaty would give the United Nations the power to end home-schooling, or something like that. And so the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body voted down a treaty inspired by our own good example because, you know, one-worldism, Obama, national socialism, and so on. And Roberts and Moran were the prime profiles in cowardice.\n\nThe only other time in his career that Washington took much notice of Roberts came during the Iraq War, when he walked point for the Bushies in bottling up for more than two years a report on how the administration misused pre-war intelligence. If you followed such things at the time, perhaps the phrase \u201cPhase II report\u201d will snap a synapse or two. Roberts made repeated promises early on that he would release the report, that there was nothing to fear and that he certainly wanted the truth. Then the weasel words crept in and he started to say things like: \u201cI\u2019m perfectly willing to do it, and that\u2019s what we agreed to do, and that door is still open. And I don\u2019t want to quarrel with Jay [Rockefeller], because we both agreed that we would get it done.\u201d He reversed himself and danced all over the floor. The report was eventually released, but long after it would have had any dramatic political impact, which was of course why Roberts delayed in the first place.\n\nSo this is the career Roberts is seeking to salvage by dragooning the man he once betrayed into last-minute service and by raising the specter of America\u2019s Nazi future. Roberts is behind right now, and GOP Governor Sam Brownback looks like he\u2019s going to lose, meaning perhaps the top two Republicans in deep-red Kansas might go down in flames. And it would be nice to think that the right-wing extremism of the Obama era would come back to bite them in, of all places, the Koch brothers\u2019 backyard.\n\nUPDATE: I see from Greg Sargent that Roberts was asked about this quote by a reporter yesterday. He said: \u201cI believe that the direction he is heading the country is more like a European socialistic state, yes. You can\u2019t tell me anything that he has not tried to nationalize.\u201d Great. So a United States senator has no idea what \"national socialism\" means. I guess in this case that qualifies as reassuring.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:35.132+0000"}

But while local groups fight back, the NRA is staying on the sidelines.\n\n\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d a male voice replied when I told him I was writing about the competing Washington State ballot initiatives on guns that are up for vote this Election Day. \u201cI\u2019ve been writing about it for a year and a half, it\u2019s a minefield,\u201d he said. \u201cDo a feature on knitting, better for your disposition.\u201d\n\nAfter we chatted for a while, \u201cone news hack to another,\u201d as he put it, he introduced himself as Dan Workman, a nationally known gun writer and communications director for the Citizens Committee to Protect the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. I found his gallows humor refreshing as he explained how ballot measure 594, which calls for universal background checks for gun buyers, appears to be ahead of 591, which is backed by gun rights groups and would nullify or negate 594.\n\nMeasure 591 says no government agency can require background checks on gun recipients \u201cunless a uniform national standard is required.\u201d There is no expectation of federal action on gun safety, and to further confuse the issue, voters in Washington State can vote for or against either or both gun measures. And while polls show 594 is likely to pass, 591 could squeak by as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear the gun lobby is counting on confusion as their best ally,\u201d says Dan Gross, President of the Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence. The National Rifle Association has not taken a position on 591 and, in our conversation, Workman confirmed that gun owners in the state are unhappy that the NRA hasn\u2019t supported them. The Citizens Committee has only raised $1.3 million\u2014compared to some $10 million on the gun safety side.\n\n\u201cThe gun prohibition movement has lucked out by having people like Michael Bloomberg\u2014he\u2019s a devoted anti-gunner\u2014and in Washington State we\u2019ve got a handful of billionaires with a B.

If they can pull off a win with 594, it would be the fifth state after New York, Connecticut, Colorado and Delaware to close the gun show loophole and expand background checks.\n\n\u201cReferendums are expensive but if you\u2019ve got pockets, which the gun safety side now has, taking the battle to the states is doable,\u201d says Jim Kessler, Co-Founder and Vice President for Policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic group.\n\nAsked what he makes of the NRA\u2019s reticence in the Washington State initiative fight, Kessler replies, \u201cIt\u2019s easier to bully politicians than to bully voters.\u201d Recalling that the Manchin-Toomey bill to expand background checks got 55 votes in the senate but fell short of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster, he says, \u201cIf there were a secret ballot in Congress, these gun laws would pass. But there isn\u2019t, and the NRA takes retribution.\u201d\n\nVoters can\u2019t be punished so easily, and Kessler speculates that if the NRA hasn\u2019t put money into Washington State by now, it\u2019s because their priority this cycle is turning the U.S. Senate Republican. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t like to fight and lose,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf they think they\u2019re going to lose, they minimally engage.\u201d\n\nThe gun safety measure on the ballot would have had no bearing on the tragedy at Marysville High School last week: The shooter\u2019s gun belonged to a family member, who had obtained it legally. But what\u2019s at stake in the Washington State vote is the road ahead, and how viable it is for the gun safety movement to turn their efforts toward the states.\n\n\u201cWe get the general disenchantment with Congress,\u201d says the Brady Campaign\u2019s Dan Gross. \u201cIt would be the definition of insanity to wait for Congress to lead and create change, that\u2019s why we\u2019re also focused on the states.\u201d\n\nThe passage of 594 would tee up similar referendums in other states, namely Nevada, where petitions are already gathering signatures, Arizona, New Mexico, and in neighboring Oregon. \u201cFor the gun rights community, there\u2019s reason to be wary,\u201d says Workman. \u201cAnd believe me, it\u2019s not paranoia if you know they\u2019re coming to get you.\u201d\n\nGun rights groups like the NRA have long played the beleaguered underdog while pressuring its opponents into silence through campaign contributions, and there\u2019s still some worry on the gun safety side that there\u2019s a stealth campaign in this vote-by-mail election that could catch everyone by surprise.\n\nBut for now the surprise is that the gun lobby is on the defensive.

Res. 19, a proposed constitutional amendment designed to \u201cadvance the fundamental principle of political equality for all, and to protect the integrity of the legislative and electoral processes.\u201d The intent of the proposed amendment is to empower the Congress and the States to limit all categories of campaign-related spending and contributions and overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United, which held independent political expenditures by businesses and unions alike to be protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIn plain English that\u2019s called censorship. It\u2019s also called hypocrisy, as many of the proposed amendment\u2019s supporters\u2014and most of its likely opponents\u2014take a situational stance on the First Amendment.\n\nMore often than not, politicians think free speech is a fine thing so long as you agree with them. What do I mean? Well, in 2006 the then-Republican-controlled Senate failed by a single vote to move forward a proposed constitutional amendment that would have given Congress the legal authority to ban flag \u201cdesecration.\u201d Fortunately, the Constitution mandates that a proposed amendment obtain the backing of two-thirds of both the House and Senate before it can be sent to the States for ratification, and the flag-burning amendment garnered only 66 of the 67 votes it needed.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Back then, many of the same folks who would stifle free speech if it comes in the form of money\u2014but not in kind, as in the form of a favorable New York Times editorial\u2014had no problem saying that it was constitutionally OK to put Old Glory to the test by putting it to the torch. The roster of Senate Democrats suffering from First Amendment schizophrenia includes former constitutional law professor and Senator Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and senior Senate Democrats Barbara Boxer, Tom Harkin, Barbara Mikulski, Patty Murray, Chuck Schumer, and Ron Wyden\u2014who rightly took the position that free speech should not be diluted in the name of some greater good, hurt feelings, or offended sensibilities.\n\nAnd to be sure, it\u2019s not that the Senate Republicans have a sterling record on free speech. It too is predictably abysmal. Eight years ago, only three Republicans opposed the flag-desecration amendment, and only one, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, still serves. Former Senator Jim DeMint, a self-proclaimed defender of freedom, liberty, the Second Amendment, and Heritage Foundation honcho, voted for the amendment, along with six-of-seven of Northeast Republicans.\n\nAt least the Senate\u2019s two leaders, Reid and McConnell, are consistent in the broader scheme of things. Reid is censorious and McConnell is libertarian. Reid supported the anti-flag-burning amendment then and backs S.J. Res. 19 now, while McConnell said \u201cno\u201d in 2006, and will say \u201cno\u201d a second time.\n\nAs befits a former Nevada Gaming Commission chair, Reid does have his blind spots about certain donors and their speech and donations. According to Reid, campaign activism by the Koch Brothers is evil, while mega-dollar independent expenditures by Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and environmental activist Tom Steyer possess a hygienic quality lacking by the likes of the Kochs.\n\nAs a small step, candidates of all parties should report their campaign contributions in real time.\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it; here\u2019s Reid uncensored: \u201cI know Sheldon Adelson\u2026 He\u2019s not in this for money\u2026 He\u2019s in it because he has certain ideological views. Sheldon Adelson\u2019s social views are in keeping with the Democrats on all kinds of things. So Sheldon Adelson, don\u2019t pick on him. He\u2019s not in it to make money.\u201d\n\nFor the record, Adelson is the same guy who once said that he regrets having served in the U.S. Army, who lost a $60 million defamation lawsuit against the National Jewish Democratic Council, and whose company admitted to having likely violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for allegedly bribing Chinese officials in connection with gambling operations in Macau.\n\nYes, the rise of independent donors as a driving political force should give us plenty of pause. But big donors are a reality of modern politics, and, like it or not, money and campaign spending are forms of protected political speech, as the Supreme Court ruled almost 40 years ago in Buckley v. Valeo.\n\nWithout the checkbook of the deep-pocketed late Stewart Mott, George McGovern may not have been the 1972 Democratic nominee; without George Soros\u2019s campaign donations and ready-made Moveon.org infrastructure, Barack Obama would have needed to have dug deeper into his own campaign\u2019s resources to build and hone his 2008 ground game.\n\nSo what to do? As a small step, candidates of all parties should take a page from George W. Bush\u2019s campaign playbook, and report their campaign contributions in real time. If sunlight really is the best disinfectant and Obama, Reid, and Schumer are truly concerned about the effects of money in politics, they should call for all candidates to disclose donations within two business days of receipt, just as corporations are required to report trades by their insiders to the Securities and Exchange Commission. They could even lead by example.\n\nThe technology for rapid reporting is already there, so there is no reason why it shouldn\u2019t be used. Already, candidates and campaigns are required to periodically disclose contributions, so it\u2019s just a matter of when, and sooner is better than later.\n\nAs for corporations, they are not people; sorry, Mitt. But their officers and shareholders do get hit up by the very same politicians who decry corporate involvement in politics. Take Schumer, for example. He strongly criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United as the \u201cworst decision\u201d since Plessy v. Ferguson, where the Court gave constitutional sanction to segregation, and held that separate was equal.\n\nSince 2009 Schumer has raised more than $22 million, with the lion\u2019s share coming in the form of large individual contributions and PAC money, and with the single biggest industry source being the financial sector. To crystalize things, Schumer raked in more than $140,000 from Paulson & Co., the folks who made billions betting on the U.S. housing crash. As a New York Times headline once blared as it described Schumer, \u201cA Champion of Wall Street Reaps Benefits.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo when Democrats decry money in politics are they really being serious, or are they just posturing? One thing\u2019s for certain, money isn\u2019t leaving politics anytime soon. As long as government is around, and politicians need their palms greased, money will be there as well. Meanwhile, Democrats and Republicans alike will drape themselves in the Constitution and the flag, except when it gets in their way.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:35.684+0000"}
{"entityId": 1948, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "In a new book on the 1987 scandal that wrecked Gary Hart\u2019s presidential chances, Matt Bai argues that the episode marks the moment when political reporting went tabloid.\n\nIf Matt Bai becomes the instrument of redemption for former senator Gary Hart, best known as the central figure in a sex scandal that sank his front-running presidential campaign and provided endless fodder for the late-night comics, he\u2019s probably just in time.\n\nHart\u2014who, according to Bai\u2019s new book, All the Truth Is Out, has struggled to find a purpose in life since his descent into tabloid hell a quarter-century ago\u2014turns 78 in November.\n\nIt will surely come as a welcome balm to a failed statesman in his twilight years that a widely respected political journalist\u2014and a wonderful writer to boot\u2014has re-examined the senator\u2019s stretch on the spit and basically signed on to his theory of the ordeal: namely, that Hart was the first victim of a political news media that had finally, in the spring of 1987, succumbed to the mob-pleasing temptation to display entertainment over serious reporting, gossip and trivialization over policy and substance, and take \u201ccharacter\u201d simply to mean \u201ccharacter flaws.\u201d\n\nWoe to the Republic, Bai argues, that visionary if imperfect leaders like Hart aren\u2019t permitted to put their talents to the benefit of the people because of a cheap, tawdry media barrier that is every bit as impassable as the Berlin Wall once was. \u201cThe Week Politics Went Tabloid\u201d is Bai\u2019s bold subtitle, suggesting that Hart\u2019s nightmare was a transformational moment. (Bai\u2019s argument is somewhat undercut by the fact that five years later, in an even less hospitable media environment, Bill Clinton survived a much tougher scandal\u2014not only the Whitewater business and the Gennifer Flowers tapes but allegations of draft-dodging and lying about it\u2014and went on to win two terms in the White House. Of course, maybe Clinton, who even post-Lewinsky ranks as one of the country\u2019s most admired public figures, wasn\u2019t as fine a president as Gary Hart would have been.)\n\nTo recap: Aided and abetted by his frequent traveling companion, Washington lobbyist Billy Broadhurst, the 52-year-old Hart sailed aboard a Miami businessman\u2019s yacht on an overnight cruise to Bimini with 29-year-old Donna Rice. The model and aspiring actress, who in the infamous photo on the cover of The National Enquirer sat skin-to-skin on the senator\u2019s naked knees, took his phone calls from the campaign trail and later on, that Friday night in May when it all came crashing down, was spotted returning from dinner with Hart and entering his Capitol Hill townhouse by a sneaky stakeout team sent by the Miami Herald.\n\nIt was a combustible combination that exploded in Hart\u2019s face. His 27-year marriage to his high school sweetheart, Lee Ludwig, had been so rocky that there were occasional separations, with the senator camped out during one such hiatus in a spare bedroom of Bob Woodward\u2019s Georgetown manse. And despite Hart\u2019s aspect of formal reserve and the sense that he thought himself too pure and too wise for the grubby business of politics, he was known to \u201clike women,\u201d as Bai reports, and widely rumored to have \u201ca zipper problem.\u201d What\u2019s more, Rice was \u201cpositively breathtaking.\u201d She \u201cwas an attractive blonde,\u201d Bai writes, \u201conly in the sense that the Sistine Chapel had some pretty good artwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat had it gotten us, this violent compression of politics and celebrity and moral policing?\u201d\n\nWhen all these particulars came light to light\u2014including Hart\u2019s spectacularly ill-advised dare to The New York Times Magazine (\u201cFollow me around. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m serious. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They\u2019ll be very bored.\u201d)\u2014the resulting media feeding frenzy was unparalleled up to that point in the ongoing melodrama of American democracy. It reached its climax at New Hampshire\u2019s Hanover Inn, where, in an overheated event space, Hart faced down a feral pack of reporters, and The Washington Post\u2019s Paul Taylor asked his famous question, \u201cHave you ever committed adultery?\u201d\n\n\u201cAhh,\u201d Hart stammered. \u201cI do not think that\u2019s a fair question.\u201d\n\nAfter Taylor presented The Post\u2019s evidence to Hart\u2019s campaign staff that the senator had in fact been sleeping around, Hart dropped out of the race with a fiery, unrepentant withdrawal speech. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to have to seriously question the system for selecting our national leaders,\u201d Hart declared, \u201cthat reduces the press of this nation to hunters and presidential candidates to being hunted, that has reporters in bushes, false and inaccurate stories printed, photographers peeking in our windows, swarms of helicopters hovering over our roofs, and my very strong wife close to tears because she can\u2019t even get into her own house at night without being harassed. And then after all that, ponderous pundits wonder in mock seriousness why some of the best people in the country choose not to run for higher office.\u201d\n\nThis book is apparently meant as an affirmation of that claim. \u201cIndeed, what had it gotten us, this violent compression of politics and celebrity and moral policing,\u201d Bai writes. \u201cAmerican history is rife with examples of people who were crappy husbands or shady dealers but great stewards of the state, just as we\u2019ve had thoroughly decent men who couldn\u2019t summon the executive skills to run a bake sale. Hart\u2019s humiliation had been the first in a seemingly endless parade of exaggerated scandals and public floggings, the harbinger of an age when the threat of instant destruction would mute any thoughtful debate, and when the perception of some personal imperfection could obliterate, or at least eclipse, whatever else had accumulated in the public record.\u201d\n\nGiven Bai\u2019s thesis, it\u2019s hardly surprising that Hart, along with his long-suffering wife of 54 years, made himself available for 20 hours of interviews with the author\u2014at the Dubliner bar near the Capitol in Washington, at his modest law office in Denver, and at their mountain redoubt in nearby Kittredge, called \u201cTroublesome Gulch,\u201d a name as ironically iconic as \u201cMonkey Business,\u201d which, unbelievably, was the name of the yacht.\n\nAt one point, inside their cabin in the woods (purchased with the help of Hart\u2019s friend Warren Beatty), Lee and Gary ruminate on the lasting damage the scandal inflicted on the nation. \u201cIt\u2019s what he could have done for the country that I think bothers him to this very day,\u201d Lee says, and Gary agrees, pointing out that if only he\u2019d made it to the White House, \u201cGeorge W. Bush wouldn\u2019t have been president\u2026And we wouldn\u2019t have invaded Iraq. And a lot of people would be alive who are dead.\u201d Punctuating his comment with a loud sigh, Hart adds: \u201cYou have to live with that, you know?\u201d\n\nBai\u2019s account of the scandal and its aftermath\u2014for which he also interviewed dozens of former campaign aides, reporters, and Donna Rice Hughes, now a happily married 56-year-old committed Christian and Internet safety advocate\u2014contains several news nuggets, notably the identity of the tipster who unleashed the Miami Herald SWAT team, a rival model named Dana Weems. Paradoxically, it was never proved that Hart and Rice had sex. Rice has always denied it, Hart won\u2019t say, a Hart aide speculates \u201cI fear not,\u201d and Bai fails to resolve the question. Yet his narrative is gripping, perceptive, and moving at times, even if his conclusions are highly debatable.\n\nBai, who was a college student when the scandal erupted, clearly developed something of a man-crush on his subject as he toiled on the book. While he acknowledges that Hart is a damaged human being, he resolves nearly every question about Hart\u2019s character\u2014such as the prevailing attitude in the Washington media-political complex that Hart was just plain \u201cweird\u201d\u2014in the senator\u2019s favor.\n\nPerhaps significantly, he omits Gail Sheehy\u2019s discovery in 1984, when Hart nearly beat Walter Mondale for the Democratic nomination, that he considered a Native American woman named Marilyn Youngbird his \u201cspiritual adviser.\u201d Youngbird boasted of her intimacy with the senator during a Comanche ceremony, saying, \u201cIt was sensual. They brushed the front and back of our bodies with eagle feathers.\u201d When Sheehy repeated to the senator Youngbird\u2019s prophecy that \u201cthe Great Spirit had chosen Gary Hart to save nature from destruction,\u201d he replied, \u201cI know. She keeps telling me that.\u201d Sheehy asked, \u201cDo you believe it?\u201d Hart\u2019s answer: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nTalk about weird!\n\nBai also commits a few minor errors, such as suggesting the Rev. Jesse Jackson had been carrying on an extramarital affair with actress Debra Winger, who was actually Nebraska Gov. Bob Kerrey\u2019s girlfriend; the married Jackson, in 1988, was rumored to be involved with Margot Kidder. And he implies that The Post\u2019s Paul Taylor was so traumatized and possibly guilt-ridden by his much-criticized role in ending Hart\u2019s presidential quest that he never covered another campaign. Yet during my stint as a Post national reporter on the 1988 campaign, many months after the Hart debacle, Taylor was an eager and energetic colleague, happily covering the campaigns of House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, Jackson, and Sen. Bob Dole, among others.\n\nIt\u2019s to Bai\u2019s credit, however, that near the end of All the Truth Is Out, he quotes Hart as he ruminates on perhaps the most compelling reason his candidacy failed\u2014and it has nothing to do with the news media. \u201c\u2018Well, this haunts me,\u2019 Hart says, his eyes brimming and red,\u201d Bai writes. \u201c\u2018Because I think you are given certain talents. And you are judged by how you use those talents. And to the degree I believe in some kind of hereafter or transmigration of the soul, I will be judged by how I did or did not use the talents that I was given. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve used them very well.\u2019\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:35.963+0000"}

Let\u2019s see how he does if he runs against an actual Clinton.\n\nLITTLE ROCK, Ark. \u2014 The story of Mike Huckabee is forever intertwined with the Clintons. And it looks like that connection will get deeper after Huckabee\u2019s appearance on FOX News Friday night saying that he plans to announce his White House plans on May 5 in Hope, Ark.\n\nThe choice of Hope is a not-so-subtle jab at Bill Clinton, who, like Huckabee, was born in Hope and who used it strategically as a slogan in his 1992 campaign for president with his slogan: \u201cI Still Believe In A Place Called Hope.\u201d\n\nHuckabee\u2019s nascent campaign offered no details on staffing, but Democrat and Republican sources say that the Huckabee camp has already leased office space in Little Rock. The Washington Post reported earlier on Friday that the former governor told reporters that a Super PAC has been established for his presumed campaign, and that a network of supporters in Iowa was being built up. He\u2019s in New Hampshire tonight.\n\nAnd Huckabee seems like he\u2019s itching for a fight. On April 12, he tweeted to Hillary: \u201cCongrats. Your announcement makes me nostalgic for our days doing political battle in Arkansas\u2026#ImStillStanding.\u201d\n\nBy choosing Hope as the site for his announcement, it appears that he plans to make the Clintons one of his main campaign objectives.\n\n\u201cGovernor Huckabee would be well-equipped to run against the Clinton machine since he has overcome it on several occasions in which he won elections that they campaigned against him or against individuals who he supported,\u201d said Doyle Webb, chairman of the Republican Party of Arkansas.\n\nThe Clinton-Huckabee feud may exist mainly in Huckabee\u2019s head, but there\u2019s little doubt that without the election of Clinton to the White House, Huckabee may never have become governor of Arkansas.\n\nHuckabee became lieutenant governor in a special election in 1993 after Clinton became president. In 1996, Huckabee ascended to the governor\u2019s office when then-Governor Jim Guy Tucker resigned after his conviction in the Whitewater scandal. From there, Huckabee went on to serve from 1996 until 2007 as governor until he was term-limited.\n\n\n\nThe Huckabees moved from Arkansas to Florida in 2010 but have maintained ties in the state through family. Marco Rubio has already claimed Florida, and Arkansas, which is now entirely Republican-controlled, offers Huckabee a spot in Middle America to continue his battle against Hillary Clinton\u2014if he survives a Republican primary\u2014one source said.\n\nJay Barth, a political science professor at Hendrix College in Conway, Ark., said that the 1993 special election set the stage for a long-standing connection between Huckabee and the Clintons.\n\n\u201cYour announcement makes me nostalgic for our days doing political battle in Arkansas...#ImStillStanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that campaign, beginning a theme that he would use throughout his Arkansas career, Huckabee said his campaign was about \u2018unplugging the [state Democratic party] machine\u2019 at a moment of exceptional unpopularity for Clinton nationally,\u201d Barth said. \u201cWhile there really was no \u2018Dem party machine,\u2019 the theme resonated with voters and helped Huckabee eke out a very close win.\u201d\n\nNewspaper articles highlight the long-standing feud between Huckabee and the Clinton machine. A 1993 Wall Street Journal editorial entitled \u201cBill\u2019s Backyard,\u201d said: \u201cMr. Huckabee ran against a Democratic machine that pulled out all the stops against him.\u201d\n\nIn every race Huckabee ran in Arkansas, the Clintons maintained a presence, and Democrats deeply connected to Clinton controlled both chambers of the legislature during Huckabee\u2019s governorship. In 1998, Bill Clinton campaigned for Huckabee\u2019s opponent, Bill Bristow, who was a lawyer for one of Clinton\u2019s state troopers in the Paula Jones saga.\n\nFour years, later in 2002, Clinton\u2019s long-time friend Jimmie Lou Fisher ran against Huckabee but lost. Clinton campaigned on Fisher\u2019s behalf and raised money for her. In that race, Huckabee said, \u201cIf you liked Bill Clinton for 12 years, then elect Jimmie Lou Fisher, because that\u2019s basically what you\u2019re going to have. She\u2019s pretty much listened to him for political strategy, for philosophy, and he\u2019s raised her funds. I think he\u2019s had his turn.\u201d\n\nJanine Parry, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas, said that while there is a long history between Huckabee and the Clintons, the feud has been blown out of proportion.\n\n\u201cThe characterization of it as some kind of epic rivalry, though, is likely one-sided,\u201d said Parry. \u201cGovernor Huckabee has tremendous political talent: he\u2019s good one-on-one and (at) working a room. But he hasn\u2019t yet parlayed those talents to the world stage. Hillary has, and for far longer, meaning she probably perceives Huckabee as only a slightly more interesting competitor than any of the apparently dozens of others.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:36.222+0000"}

The longer he stays in office, the bigger the target on his back.\n\nNervous Democrats in competitive races in November have found one surefire way to try to deflect the political damage from the VA scandal: calling for Eric Shinseki\u2019s head.\n\nWith the scandal over secret wait lists at hospitals run by the Department of Veterans Affairs exploding, Shinseki, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, is coming under pressure to resign not just from Republicans but an increasing number of Democrats as well.\n\nFor these anxious Democrats, throwing Shinseki under the bus is a safe play to create distance from an increasingly toxic political scandal.\n\nThroughout Wednesday in the wake of a scathing report from VA\u2019s inspector general, it seemed every Democrat in a close race in November was scrambling to condemn Shinseki and call for his head in the scandal\u2014a marked contrast to their reluctance to go after Kathleen Sebelius during the early failure of healthcare.gov last year.\n\nMark Udall, a first-term senator facing a tough race in the swing state of Colorado, said \u201cthe systemic problems at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are so entrenched that they require new leadership to be fixed. Secretary Shinseki must step down.\u201d John Walsh, a Montana Democrat was appointed to the Senate seat vacated by Max Baucus last year and considered an underdog to keep his seat in November, demanded \u201cIt is time for President Obama to remove Secretary Shinseki from office.\u201d\n\nDemocratic hopefuls outside Washington, D.C. also didn\u2019t hesitate to call on Shinseki to quit. Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic nominee for Senate against Mitch McConnell, called on Shinseki to quit last Thursday, saying, \u201cWe owe a solemn obligation to our veterans, and our government defaulted on that contract. I don\u2019t see how that breach of trust with our veterans can be repaired if the current leadership stays in place.\u201d Michelle Nunn, the Democratic candidate in Georgia\u2019s open Senate seat, echoed Grimes in calling for Shinseki to step down as well.\n\n\u201cWe owe a solemn obligation to our veterans, and our government defaulted on that contract. I don't see how that breach of trust with our veterans can be repaired if the current leadership stays in place.\"\n\nIn fact, the list of Democrats calling for Shinseki to go increasingly resembles an election simulation by Nate Silver. Democratic congressman in vulnerable seats like Nick Rahall and John Barrow and those seeking to move to the Senate like Bruce Braley are now demanding Shinseki step down. The most notable defectors on Thursday included Mark Warner, a first-term Senator from Virginia who faces a competitive re-election in a state packed with veterans and DCCC Chair Steve Israel, who is the first member of Democratic leadership to call on Shinseki to step down.\n\nAsked Wednesday evening whether Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA), one of the country\u2019s most vulnerable Democrats, had confidence in Shinseki, a spokesman said that there was \u201cno news currently.\u201d\n\nLandrieu has previously called the VA crisis \u201ccompletely inexcusable,\u201d and is collaborating with Republican Sen. Jerry Moran to propose a Veterans Affairs funding bill that would give the Secretary of Veterans Affairs increased power to reprimand senior officials for mismanagement at VA hospitals.\n\nSen. Mark Pryor (D-AR), another vulnerable red-state Democrat, did not immediately respond to a question from The Daily Beast about whether Shinseki should resign. On Thursday though, Pryor said at a press conference that he's not ready to call on Shinseki to step down.\n\nBut Pryor also stressed last week that reports about the VA were \u201cextremely disturbing.\u201d In a letter to Shinseki, the Arkansas Senator demanded a \u201ca full explanation of your department\u2019s plan to address this situation.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, a conservative veterans group linked to the Koch brothers is already running ads targeting vulnerable Senate Democrats including Landrieu and Pryor.\n\nThere is one person on Capitol Hill who notably has not called on Shinseki to resign. Republican Speaker John Boehner told reporters Thursday that while he would continue to reserve judgment, he didn\u2019t think the VA Secretary should resign at present. \u201cIs him resigning going to get us to the bottom of the problem? Is it going to help us find what\u2019s really going on? And the answer I keep getting is no.\u201d\n\nOf course, Shinseki\u2019s continued presence in office though provides political benefits for Boehner and the GOP. Shinseki is an easy political pi\u00f1ata for Republicans to hit. Just as Kathleen Sebelius at the end of her tenure at HHS became a convenient personification of the failures of the rollout of Obamacare, Shinseki has now embodies the VA scandal. The longer he stays in office, the bigger the target on his back.\n\nThe only difference between Sebelius and Shinseki is that Democrats had far more reason to rally behind the former Health and Human Services Secretary. Her failures related to Obamacare, the signature legislative achievement of Democrats in the 21st century. In contrast, VA hospitals have no such partisan patina and the VA scandal has provoked bipartisan outrage as a fundamental failure of the healthcare system that American veterans rely upon. There is no reason for Democrats to show loyalty to Shinseki as a result or \u201ctake one for the team\u201d as he becomes a political albatross.\n\nShinseki\u2019s days at the VA seem to be numbered. The only question is how many more Democrats need call for his resignation before the retired general finally falls on his own sword.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:36.487+0000"}

For comparison\u2019s sake, Romney\u2019s Bain had more than $70 billion under management.\n\nA recent Bloomberg report on both the SEC filings and Bush\u2019s work with Britton Holdings is full of details you\u2019d rather not have to explain as a Republican presidential candidate, particularly in a cycle when economic populism has gripped the GOP base. Conservative confabs now feature Ted Cruz slamming \u201cthe rich and powerful,\u201d while Rand Paul warns of the folly of being the party of \u201cfat cats, rich people, and Wall Street.\u201d\n\nWhile Cruz and Paul hammer Wall Street and rich guys, Bush\u2019s partners in Britton Holdings include a former banker from the now-defunct Lehman Brothers, the high-flying Wall Street bank that collapsed just before the bailouts of 2008, as well as two former advisers to Credit Suisse. Among its investments, Britton Holdings is focusing some on shale oil and gas exploration, including the controversial practice of fracking. A major backer for one Britton Holdings investment is a Chinese conglomerate active in the energy sector.\n\nThose don\u2019t seem like the choices of a man preparing to face the microscopic scrutiny of a presidential campaign, but Steve Scheffler, a Republican National Committeeman for the Iowa GOP, doesn\u2019t consider Bush\u2019s private equity play a deal breaker for Iowa conservatives in 2016.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a non-issue. The only people making a big deal about it are Democrats and the media. When a Democrat with money runs, you never hear a word about it,\u201d Scheffler told The Daily Beast. The bigger problem for Bush in Iowa, he said, will be Bush\u2019s shifting position on immigration, which may or may not include a path to citizenship, and the fact that Bush hasn\u2019t been making the rounds though the state the way Paul, Cruz, and other possible candidates have. \u201cBut as long as he gets in front of the other issue, the private equity, I don\u2019t think it would be a problem.\u201d\n\nWhile Cruz and Paul hammer Wall Street and rich guys, Bush\u2019s partners in Britton Holdings include a former banker from the now-defunct Lehman Brothers, the high-flying Wall Street bank that collapsed just before the bailouts of 2008, as well as two former advisers to Credit Suisse.\n\nTo Scheffler\u2019s point, Romney\u2019s troubles in 2012 were not inherently based on the fact that he worked in private equity. Polls leading up to the 2012 primary elections showed that voters, especially Republicans, believed that Romney\u2019s business background would actually serve as an asset in the White House. A February 2012 Washington Post-ABC News poll showed four times as many Americans, 48 percent to 12 percent, calling Romney\u2019s business experience a reason to support rather than oppose him.\n\nBut as the campaign wore on, Romney struggled to frame his work in private equity in a way that was anything but confusing and occasionally offensive to voters. From declaring, \u201cI like being able to fire people,\u201d to telling an ornery Iowan at the state fair, \u201cCorporations are people, my friend,\u201d and ultimately advancing his theory that 47 percent of Americans would vote for President Obama because they consider themselves \u201cvictims,\u201d Romney\u2019s image morphed from competent businessman to a caricature of an out-of-touch, almost cruel robber baron.\n\nAs the general election reached full force, Democrats exploited Romney\u2019s ties to Bain, whether he had been involved in specific Bain decisions or not. In one ad blitz, former employees at a closed steel mill call Romney and Bain job destroyers and economic vampires. \u201cThey came in and sucked the life out of us,\u201d said one steelworker.\n\nBy Election Day, the words \u201cRomney\u201d and \u201cBain\u201d had become closely associated with a broken economic system that put profits ahead of ordinary people. Of all of the segments of the electorate that Romney lost, one of the largest margins came among people who wanted a president who \u201ccares about people.\u201d Romney lost those voters to Obama 18 percent to 81 percent.\n\nTwo years later, Republicans again find themselves with a wide-open field and a potentially strong national candidate in Bush\u2014who now has a private equity job at the top of his resume.\n\nBut the biggest problem for Republicans, particularly establishment Republicans who are still looking for a 2016 standard bearer, isn\u2019t the fact that Bush is in the business of making money, just as Romney was. Bush\u2019s two terms as Florida governor, his family legacy, and his own work on immigration would likely play a larger role defining him as a candidate than buying a portion of an oil shipping company through an investment firm.\n\nInstead, establishment Republicans\u2019 biggest problem is that private equity is perhaps the last business Bush would join if he really wanted to be president in 2016.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:36.769+0000"}

Totally absent.\n\nUp to now, President Obama and congressional Democrats had thought \u201cso-called\u201d scandals involving Benghazi, the IRS, and Operation Fast and Furious were largely behind them. Nothing to see, just Republican witch hunts designed to embarrass the president and perhaps land blows against Hillary Clinton. But recent revelations about shoddy care at Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities across the country have brought bipartisan condemnation from Capitol Hill that should worry a commander in chief whose reaction to the brewing tempest has been muted at best.\n\nWhat is most surprising about the present controversy surrounding the substandard treatment at the VA, in which at least 40 veterans lost their lives while awaiting treatment, is that House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-FL) had alerted the president to trouble nearly a year ago. In a letter dated May 21, 2013, Miller began:\n\nDear Mr. President: I am writing to bring to your attention an alarming pattern of serious and significant patient care issues at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) across the country. Recent events at the Atlanta, Georgia, VAMC provide a perfect illustration of the management failures, deceptions, and lack of accountability permeating VA\u2019s healthcare system\u2026I believe your direct involvement and leadership is required.\n\nA year on from Chairman Miller\u2019s letter, the revelations of substandard care, neglect, and waste seem to have magnified, rather than been reduced. For a president who seems to have endless amounts of time to talk about the miseries of those living on the minimum wage, Obama\u2019s seeming indifference to the severity of the problems faced by our returning veterans seeking care at VA facilities is shocking.\n\nLate last week, CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper grilled White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough on the lackluster attempts by the administration to address mismanagement issues\u2014if not criminally negligent behavior\u2014at the VA. What I found revealing about the interview is the exchange where Tapper questions whether Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki is up to the task at hand given that Miller warned the president a year ago about serious allegations of misconduct at the agency:\n\nJake Tapper: How many stories like this, how many letters like this, how many dead veterans do you need before someone asks the question within the White House maybe this guy isn\u2019t the best steward of these veterans?\n\nDenis McDonough: The question, Jake, is are we doing everything we can every day to get the veterans the care and opportunities that they\u2026\n\nJake Tapper: \u2026 But you\u2019re not, this letter was sent a year ago and you guys ignored it.\n\nThus far, President Obama and his team have regarded the scandalous treatment of veterans seeking care from the government over which they preside as a political hiccup rather than an indefensible breakdown in competent management that has led to the deaths of at least 40 veterans. Late last week, McDonough assured us that Obama is \u201cmadder than hell\u201d about the VA fiasco.\n\nPlease. We\u2019ve seen the president show genuine flashes of anger toward the GOP in general, the Supreme Court following rulings he disagrees with, and anyone else who has the temerity to disagree with him on anything. In the present case Obama has largely been silent, absent, and behind closed doors\u2014content to let Secretary Shinseki and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney bear the brunt of the growing storm in the media.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the president show genuine flashes of anger toward anyone who has the temerity to disagree with him on anything. In the present case Obama has largely been silent.\n\nWhat is most shocking to me about the VA tempest is that it repeats a pattern of conduct we\u2019ve seen from the president and his administration. Obama ran for president and asked Americans to hire him for another term based on his leadership skills, temperament, and ability to produce results. Instead, we\u2019ve seen the president and his team evade responsibility (and with a tiresome frequency) for areas in which they are directly responsible, parse words in an attempt to mislead, and otherwise duck long enough for the political storm of the moment to pass over for sunnier days ahead.\n\nNot this time. Americans of all political persuasions stand in solidarity behind those brave men and women who don the uniform to defend us from those who seek to harm our country and our allies. My Daily Beast colleague Jacob Siegel exclusively revealed that the VA facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico is only the latest hospital to keep secret waiting lists\u2014and to destroy documents revealing criminal misconduct.\n\nA real leader stands up, accepts responsibility, and moves swiftly to fix management problems. A coward blames others, fails to accept responsibility, and reveals himself as small and not up to the duty and obligation to those he was elected to serve. The American people will discover in short order whether the president steps up to lead our returning heroes in the military to ensure they receive the medical care they have earned or whether he cowers to serve his political ambitions rather than accept responsibility. If he does the former, he will be justly applauded\u2014if he does the latter the American people will be madder than hell at him for failing our veterans when they needed him the most. If Obama\u2019s past actions are any indication of what we can expect he\u2019ll do to resolve the scandalous mismanagement at the VA, I believe his standing with the American people will continue to erode to due to his failure to lead decisively.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:37.533+0000"}

Rubio has held public office since age 29. His Wikipedia profile states \u201cpolitician\u201d as his profession. Given that most Americans believe that \u201cpolitician\u201d is not exactly a highly respected career path, Rubio may at least want to change his Wiki profile to read \u201cpublic servant.\u201d\n\nIn fact, he may be forced into a career change. Why? Because Senator Rubio is up for a difficult reelection in November 2016, and he told Jonathan Karl that if he runs for president he would not simultaneously run for the Senate.\n\nThis could be construed as a jab at Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who is actively considering both. But Rubio does not have a choice because Florida law prevents ambitious politicians from having their names appear twice on the ballot for different offices, as does Kentucky. And Paul has more in-state political clout and is engaged in changing the law in Kentucky, while Rubio has accepted the Sunshine State status quo.\n\nA quick glance at the Real Clear Politics poll averages for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination indicates that Rubio would be better off focusing all his energy on his Senate reelection if he wants to keep \u201cpolitician\u201d as his current profession. The current three leaders are Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee with 13 percent each, and Jeb Bush at 12.3 percent. Rubio is stuck in the middle at 6.5 percent.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t even fare well at home. The latest Quinnipiac survey of 2016 GOP voters has Jeb Bush winning 27 percent, Rand Paul garnering 14 percent and Rubio trailing at 11 percent. Furthermore, in a Florida 2016 general election match-up Hillary Clinton stomps Rubio by a margin of 52 to 40 percent.\n\nA GOP official told me that a deal was struck: If Jeb runs for president, then Rubio would drop out.\n\nSo things don\u2019t look so encouraging for Rubio. But he may not be seriously eyeing a White House run anyway: A high-ranking GOP party official who asked that his name be withheld told me on Monday that Jeb Bush\u2019s people have just met with Rubio\u2019s people and a 2016 deal was struck: If Jeb runs for president, then Rubio would drop out\u2014and \u201cJeb is running,\u201d according to my well-placed source. (Alert the media!)\n\nHow far Rubio has fallen since early 2013 when, after Romney\u2019s defeat and with the GOP leaderless, he surged in popularity. TIME Magazine featured him on the February 18, 2013 cover as \u201cThe Republican Savior.\u201d But once he voted with Senate Democrats to pass comprehensive immigration reform, his star began its dramatic fall from \u201csavior\u201d heaven.\n\nNow with Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential end game already pre-determined and Jeb calling the shots, look for Rubio to drop out of the presidential race as late as possible but early enough so he can still run for Senate reelection.\n\nRubio knows his race will be tough, since 2016 is the first time he would face a traditional two-person Senate battle. (His 2010 election was a quirky three-way race.) It has already been reported that Rubio\u2019s most likely and strongest opponent would be Florida Congresswoman and chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nFurthermore, in a presidential election year, with Clinton likely at the top of the ticket, the electorate is going to be very different from the one that gave Rubio 49 percent of the vote in 2010. His Democratic opponent, especially if it is Wasserman Schultz, could easily ride Hillary\u2019s coattails to a Senate victory (or conversely, Rubio could ride Jeb\u2019s). Either way, count on the 2016 Florida race to be the Mother of All Senate Battles.\n\nIn his interview with Karl, Rubio, acknowledging the early polls that show him floundering, joked: \u201cIt\u2019s probably the \u2018TIME\u2019 cover jinx, just like the \u2018Sports Illustrated\u2019 jinx.\u201d As a Republican who hopes that her party can win the White House in 2016, I can tell you it is not the TIME \u201ccover jinx\u201d that was the cause of Marco Rubio\u2019s downward career trajectory but rather his ambition for the sake of ambition.\n\nVoters are turned off by a raw quest for power and instead ask, \u201cWhat has he done?\u201d Thus, Republicans are looking for leaders who have earned power through leadership rather than being anointed leaders by the media.\n\nA recent Bloomberg Businessweek piece framed Rubio\u2019s problem well: \u201cAs the media\u2019s infatuation moved on to Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, he began the painstaking work of trying to recast himself as a policy wonk.\u201d\n\nThe piece concluded with this statement: \u201cHe\u2019s become a fount of policy proposals with a plan, or at least a promise of one, for just about everything.\u201d He\u2019s trying too hard to make himself relevant.\n\nBut since leadership takes guts, Rubio\u2019s real future will be determined by less talk and more action, even at the risk of going against his party like he did on immigration reform before he backed down.

Meanwhile, the Republican fear campaign is running out of steam.\n\nCan you remember a time when the political zeitgeist has ping-ponged the way ours has in just two months? The day after last November\u2019s election, Barack Obama was finished. Now, two positive jobs reports and a 60-odd-cent-per-gallon drop in gasoline prices later, he\u2019s the president again. And the Republicans have just taken power and have run Congress for only two weeks, but suddenly they\u2019re kind of on the defensive.\n\nOf course this isn\u2019t to say that Obama is going to get a single plank of the ambitious agenda he laid out in the State of the Union Address through Congress. The Republicans still hold those cards.\n\nBut what\u2019s happened in the last couple of months, and what Obama seized effectively with this speech, is this. The mood has changed. The public is open to ideas it wasn\u2019t open to a year ago; even two months ago.\n\nPolitics in this country is really about only one thing at a time, and that one thing favors one party or the other. In 1981 and for a few years thereafter, it was about how oppressive the federal government was. Advantage Republicans. For a short time in the late 1980s, it was about how we\u2019d vanquished the Soviet Union (and won a little side war). Advantage Republicans.\n\nFor a while in the 1990s, it was about building a future-oriented economy. Advantage Democrats. After 9/11, it was about security. Advantage Republicans. And so on. It\u2019s a little more complicated than this, because thrown into these cycles we have the scandals and the social changes that all have some impact on how people think about things, but basically, this is how American politics rolls: We go through these eras, and the eras make the majority of people decide that one party or the other is better equipped to do something about the challenges.\n\nPeople are now willing to start thinking about longer-term economic goals. That really should worry Republicans, no matter how many seats they have in Congress.\n\nAnd now, we seem to be\u2014seem to be\u2014entering an era in which the chief debate is going to be about expanding prosperity downward from the people who\u2019ve enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of the prosperity of the last 30 years. Not positive about that. But that\u2019s the smell. Look at all those minimum-wage initiatives that passed on ballots last November, passed even by a comparatively conservative electorate. Look at Mitt Romney talking empathetically in recent days about the people he didn\u2019t seem to care much about in 2012. Something has turned.\n\nObama has helped turn it\u2014with a few speeches over the years, and certainly with some of his policies, like health care, which he defended in an impressively in-your-face way in this speech. But even a president can\u2019t turn it himself. He needs luck. And finally he\u2019s had some\u2014the gas prices, the energy explosion, the jobs reports, all of them culminating in a sunnier public mood.\n\nAll that adds up to an atmosphere in which a majority of Americans are finally starting to add two and two and get four. The Republicans didn\u2019t give them much. The Great Recession, most notably. Obama, to most of them, still hasn\u2019t given them all that much either, but at least we\u2019re out of that mess and things are finally looking up.\n\nAnd when things are looking up, people are less anxious, and they can start thinking about things like free community college. In lousy economic times, free community college sounds to your average person like a bunch of airy-fairy liberal nonsense. Like something they\u2019re going to be stuck paying for. In better economic times, it sounds to your average person like a not-half-bad idea, and something they or someone they know might even benefit from.\n\nIt\u2019s all public psychology. We liberals have a hard time accepting this. That\u2019s because of Keynes. Keynes, see, has taught us the concept of counter-cyclical investment: that when the economy is in dire straits, that is exactly when the government should be spending a boatload of money. It makes economic sense, to people who read a lot. But to average people, it doesn\u2019t make any common sense. Common sense tells average people that when the economy is in dire straits, you tighten your belt and spend less. This is right for a family, but wrong for a government, which is the opposite of a family, economically speaking. And Lord did it infuriate liberals when Obama himself played into it. He gave these speeches\u2014what, 2010, maybe\u2014when he likened the government to a family sitting around the kitchen table deciding what expenses it needed to cut out.\n\nNo! Wrong, wrong, wrong, in economic terms. But in real-life political terms, he was right at least insofar as you can\u2019t get people to think about longer-term economic goals when they\u2019re out of a job, or underemployed. But once that\u2019s turned, you can.\n\nThat is what\u2019s turning now\u2014not turned, but turning. And that is what is about to make our political conversation be about this new one thing: sharing the prosperity. The speech was not a great speech, a speech for the ages; but it did understand that, and it did tap into that. People are now willing to start thinking about longer-term economic goals. A quickie CNN poll found that the speech was extremely well-received: 51 percent very positive, 30 percent somewhat positive, only 18 percent negative.\n\n\n\nThat really should worry Republicans, no matter how many seats they have in Congress. Our politics is becoming about one big thing on which the Republicans have nothing to say. Actually, they do have something to say, and it\u2019s \u201cNo!\u201d They looked ridiculous, sitting on their hands, refusing to applaud simple and obvious things that have 60, 65 percent public support.

You\u2019re also the party with many members, both rank-and-file and office-holding, who have been saying since 2009 that Barack Obama never was the legitimate president, that he was born in Kenya, that ACORN stole the election for him. You\u2019re the party that has tried to convert every act of governmental incompetence or mischief into a high crime and misdemeanor, going back as far as May 2010, when Darrell Issa first mentioned the I-word. And you\u2019re the party with about a dozen (you can peruse this comprehensive list here) candidates out there right now, challengers and incumbents, who refuse to rule out impeachment. And you\u2019re the party in which 57 percent of your members, according to a recent poll, want to impeach Obama. And finally, you\u2019re the party whose third-ranking leader in the House, Steve Scalise, was pushed three times this weekend by Fox News host Chris Wallace to rule out impeachment as John Boehner had, but who three times refused to do so.\n\n\n\nBut we\u2019re supposed to just forget all that and take our unnamed aide\u2019s word for it. It looks like Mike Allen did just that. You\u2019ll forgive me if I don\u2019t quite believe.\n\nYou\u2019re the party with about a dozen candidates out there right now, challengers and incumbents, who refuse to rule out impeachment.\n\nBoehner may be saying no to impeachment, but he has to, and it\u2019s obvious why he has to: He leads the Republican Party in Washington. As such, he needs to persuade the Mike Allen types that his party isn\u2019t bonkers. And he knows that if he were to say it\u2014as opposed to his nutty back-benchers saying it\u2014then it becomes the defining issue of this election cycle, and that\u2019s the last thing he wants, because that means blacks and young people will come out to vote in swarms this November. So House members like Louie Gohmert and Ted Yoho and Blake Farenthold and Jason Chaffetz and Kerry Bentivolio (impeachment would be \u201ca dream come true\u201d) and the rest of them can scream it all they want. Boehner knows that as long as he says no, most of the press will believe him.\n\nBut there is, of course, no reason why they should. Even if Boehner means what he says, his track record of bending his caucus to his iron will isn\u2019t exactly without blemish. If fact it\u2019s usually worked in reverse. Remember, he supposedly wanted an immigration bill. And he could get it passed tomorrow if he announced he was bringing it to the floor and calling it a \u201cconscience vote,\u201d which would free the 30 or so Republicans who\u2019d be willing to join nearly every Democrat in voting for it and passing it. But he\u2019s afraid of his right flank and will never do that. He doesn\u2019t run his caucus. His caucus runs him.\n\nSo let\u2019s project forward in time. I presume most Republicans will be clever enough to mute impeachment talk before November. Then, afterward, the sluices will open. I used to think that if the Democrats held the Senate, the House Republicans wouldn\u2019t bother, knowing that they could never get a conviction out of the Senate, and so they\u2019d not actually be able to remove Obama from office.\n\nBut lately I\u2019m revising that view. The question here is, what\u2019s the point in their minds of impeaching him? If it is a rational point\u2014to remove the high misdemeanant from office\u2014then the above scenario holds water. But I think the point isn\u2019t rational; it\u2019s emotional. To punish him for daring to act like the president. Hoist that big historical asterisk skyward and place it next to his name. Try to ensure that future generations see his as a less-than-legitimate presidency. And, not least, get their right-wing kum-ba-yah-yah\u2019s out, give the base a song they can really dance to.\n\nAnd what about the ethics of the Democrats raising money off all this? Wait a second. We\u2019re talking about political fund-raising here. There are ethics?! And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Republicans had done exactly the same thing back during the 2006 election. See? Told you I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\n\nI can hear the rationalistas: no way they\u2019d do it. They\u2019re too smart for that. They know it didn\u2019t work last time. They\u2019ll be too mindful that it might hurt them in 2016. I say nonsense to all that. They\u2019ll do it because it\u2019s who they are. They keep showing us who they are. Someday, Washington might actually believe them.\n\n", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:39.536+0000"}

In the House, however, Paul has a band of cheerleaders\u2014and they seem to follow him everywhere.\n\nAmash and Massie had spent the duration of Paul\u2019s lengthy speech observing from the benches in the back of the Senate chamber and out in the hallway, promising to block any measure the Senate sent to the House in the event that they were able to get something passed before the PATRIOT Act expired at midnight. Amash said he and Massie\u2014along with members of the Liberty Caucus\u2014had remained in D.C. last week to \u201cguard the House\u201d from any leadership attempts to pass the renewals.\n\n\u201cThere can\u2019t be unanimous consent if one person objects,\u201d Massie told Bloomberg Politics\u2019 David Weigel. Amash countered: \u201cAnd we would object.\u201d\n\nAmash, Republican from Michigan, is just 35 and looks like a young Dan Hedaya.\n\nAmash is known for his vague libertarianism and beloved by liberty-movement types for reading the Constitution ahead of every vote. House Republican leadership has been less impressed\u2014he was kicked off the House Budget Committee in 2012 for voting against their wishes too many times.\n\n(Amash Tweeted on Wednesday to contest this characterization of him: \u201cI\u2019m not vaguely libertarian,\u201d he said. Though, many capital-L libertarians take issue with r-Republicans describing themselves as full-fledged libertarians.)\n\nHis Twitter bio boasts \u201cI defend #liberty,\u201d and there is a Facebook page, \u201cRand Paul Justin Amash 2016,\u201d devoted to the dream that Paul might choose him as his running mate. Its tagline is \u201cRestore the Republic.\u201d It has over 1,600 \u201clikes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe each have an obligation to support and defend the Constitution,\u201d Amash said in the Capitol on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our part on the House side and he\u2019s doing his part on the Senate side.\u201d\n\nAmash said he, Massie, and Paul are personal friends, but said \u201cwe don\u2019t interact with each other on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nAccording to Massie, however, communication with Paul has been constant as the PATRIOT debate has raged on. \u201cThis past week we spoke frequently,\u201d Massie said on Tuesday while exiting a press conference with Paul. Asked through what means they communicate, Massie said that if they texted, \u201cWell, then they could intercept it\u2014nah, I\u2019m just kidding.\u201d\n\nMassie, 44, who like Paul is from Kentucky, is another vaguely libertarian Republican, though he doesn\u2019t quite have the star-wattage of Amash. The libertarian periodical Reason described Massie as \u201cLibertarian(ish),\u201d and \u201cKentucky\u2019s Next Rand Paul.\u201d In August 2013, a member of Paul\u2019s digital staff, \u201cLibertarian Girl,\u201d spoke out in support of Massie on Facebook: \u201cCongressman Thomas Massie is one of my favorite congressman\u2026Shhh don\u2019t tell anyone but I think he might be a libertarian. [sic].\u201d She added a smiley face.\n\nMassie said that what he, Paul, and Amash are advocating for is what the American people want. Their views, he said, are \u201cvery popular in Kentucky and everywhere I go. They\u2019re only unpopular inside the Beltway. Like, just go to social media. Go look on Facebook, Twitter\u2014you just won\u2019t see any grassroots movement against what Senator Paul is doing.\u201d\n\nMassie isn\u2019t wrong: Last month, Pew Research Center released its latest analysis of Americans\u2019 views on the surveillance state. They found that 54 percent of Americans \u201cdisapprove of the U.S. government\u2019s collection of telephone and Internet data as part of anti-terrorism efforts.\u201d\n\nRepublicans and independents, according to Pew, \u201care more likely to disapprove than approve,\u201d while Democrats remain split.\n\nPaul\u2019s posse is rounded out by Congressman Raul Labrador, Republican from Idaho. Labrador, who looks like a cross between Jimmy Kimmel and Nathan Lane, has a formal role on Paul\u2019s campaign, as the \u201cwestern states\u201d chairman. \u201cHe and I have been friends for a long time,\u201d Labrador told KTVB. He added that he will also be \u201ca little bit of a policy adviser\u201d on the campaign, \u201cworking with him on some of the issues that he\u2019s developing, and just making sure that he has a good opportunity to be represented out here in the West.\u201d\n\nAhead of Paul\u2019s \u201cfilibuster,\u201d his campaign sent out a press release, advertising that there were \u201csurrogates available to comment\u201d on what he was doing. It read: \u201cAs Senator Paul is occupied on the Senate floor, Congressmen Raul Labrador, Justin Amash and Thomas Massie, among others, have made themselves available for media interviews.\u201d\n\nWhen photos of Paul, Amash, and Massie leaving the Capitol and heading toward the Tesla surfaced on Sunday, they became, as all the best posses do, a meme.\n\nA Reddit thread of the photo has over 3,000 comments.\n\nTwitter responded by comparing them to the poster for the 1992 Quentin Tarantino hit Reservoir Dogs.\n\n@Darth photoshopped the lawmakers as \u201cbulk collection dogs.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Joshua Green retorted that he would \u201chave gone with \u2018Reservoir Dorks.\u2019\u201d\n\nJackie Kucinich contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated to include additional comment from Representative Amash.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:40.096+0000"}
{"entityId": 1958, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "From Obama and Iraq to the causes of death of black men, PunditFact checks the talking heads against the record.\n\nBy Katie Sanders and Aaron Sharockman\n\nRepublicans say President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to pull U.S. armed forces out of Iraq created an incubator that allowed the Islamic State to thrive.\n\nBut according to ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz, Obama himself wanted to keep troops stationed in the Middle Eastern powder keg.\n\nThe Obama administration originally \"wanted 10,000 troops to remain in Iraq,\u201d Raddatz said Sunday on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cNot combat troops, but military advisers (and) special operations forces, to watch the counterterrorism effort.\u201d\n\nThe idea that Obama wanted troops to remain in Iraq flies in the face of his very memorable campaign pledge to end the war in Iraq.\n\nBut Raddatz\u2019s statement rates Mostly True.\n\nHow? Because Obama initially tried to keep thousands of troops in Iraq to ease the transition and discourage militant attacks.\n\nIn the summer and early fall of 2011, ahead of a Jan. 1, 2012, deadline for removing U.S. forces from Iraq, Obama administration officials worked on plans to keep some troops behind, as detailed in a 2012 New York Times report.\n\nDefense Department officials initially suggested a sizable residual force, with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 24,000 troops. But Obama found 10,000 troops more acceptable, according to reports.\n\nBut even that proposal would be cut nearly in half during negotiations with Iraqi leaders. Obama ruled out the 10,000-troop option in an August 2011 conference call, leaning instead on a plan that called for 3,500-5,000 troops.\n\nThat never happened. U.S. and Iraqi leaders were unable to reach any agreement because the Iraqis were unwilling to provide American personnel immunity in Iraqi courts.\n\nOn Oct. 21, 2011, Obama announced the pullout of the vast majority of American troops in Iraq by that Christmas.\n\nAside from Iraq, pundits on Sunday focused on the situation in Ferguson, Mo., where 18-year-old African-American Michael Brown was shot and killed by a white police officer.\n\nFox pundit Juan Williams expounded upon a column he wrote for the Wall Street Journal in which he described \u201cthuggish behavior\u201d as creating a culture of violence in African-American communities.\n\n\u201cThe violent behavior of young black men and the police response have become a window on racial fears,\u201d Williams wrote. On Fox News Sunday Williams said, \u201cOn the black side of this equation, I think there\u2019s fear of intimidation, harassment being legitimized by the fact that there is a high rate of crime, especially among young black men.\n\n\u201cNo. 1 cause of death, young black men 15 to 34 \u2014 murder,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWho\u2019s committing the murder? Not police. Other black men.\u201d\n\nWe decided to check Williams\u2019 claim that the leading cause of death for African-American males 15-34 is murder.\n\nThat\u2019s True.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homicide was indeed the No. 1 killer of black men between the ages of 15 and 34 in 2011, the most recent year with statistics available. Accidents were the second leading cause of death.\n\nCompared to other ethnicities, the numbers really stand out. Forty percent of all African-Americans 15-34 who died were murdered, according to the CDC, compared to just 3.8 percent of all whites who died. Overall, 14 percent of all men 15-34 who died in 2011 were murdered.\n\nAs the laws of aging go, younger men are less prone to fall victim to natural causes of death, so they are more likely to die of unnatural causes. And the racial disparity between those causes has partially to do with the likelihood of getting into car-related accidents, said James Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University.\n\n\u201cSuburban whites drive more than urban blacks, and putting in more miles on highways \u2014 that\u2019s important because not a lot of people are going to get killed in fender benders in neighborhood streets,\u201d Fox said. \u201cThere are relatively few auto accidents in black urban areas.\u201d\n\nBeyond driving habits, the criminal homicide rate among young black males is significantly higher than other groups. This, experts agreed, has to do with poverty and geography.\n\nThe difference in social structures, access to jobs, educational opportunities, and many other factors between impoverished black neighborhoods and others is often a matter of life and death, according to Eli Silverman, professor emeritus at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\n\u201cThe (homicide) numbers highlight the condition in minority areas, where a lot of violence occurs and the whole way of life is further intensified because police surveillance is always trying to track down people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have heightened survival instincts, will do anything to survive, and they\u2019ll seek retribution for anything \u2026 because they don\u2019t trust law enforcement.\u201d\n\nLinda Qiu contributed to this report.

Dianne Feinstein claimed she\u2019s been kept in the dark since 2012.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Obama insisted that he had \u201cconsulted with Congress for quite some time\u201d over the possibility of swapping Taliban detainees for American hostage Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. That\u2019s news to Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, who said it\u2019s been more than two years since she was consulted on the issue, adding that the exchange was greeted by the Senate Intelligence Committee with \u201csurprise and dismay.\u201d\n\nNews of Bergdahl\u2019s release this past weekend has stirred controversy in part because the Obama administration side-stepped a legal requirement to give Congress 30 days\u2019 advance notice.\n\nIn late Nov. 2011, Feinstein was first briefed on the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to trade five senior Taliban detainees at Guantanamo for Bergdahl, she told reporters Tuesday.\n\nAlarmed at the prospect, Feinstein and her Republican vice-chairman Saxby Chambliss, wrote two classified letters expressing their views\u2014in Dec. 2011 to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and to the president himself in Jan. 2012.\n\n\u201cBoth letters registered concerns with the proposals, and opposed the transfers of the detainees to Qatar,\u201d Feinstein said.\n\nFeinstein and Chambliss say that Clinton responded in a letter on Feb. 13, 2012, acknowledging that a 30-day forewarning was necessary for any prisoner exchange and promising future consultation with Congress.\n\nFeinstein said there was no additional consultation until mid-day Saturday, when one of her senior aides received a call from Deputy Director of National Intelligence Robert Cardillo.\n\nCardillo told the aide that Bergdahl was back in United States custody, and that the Taliban detainees at Guantanamo Bay were being flown to Qatar.\n\nFeinstein\u2019s description of the White House\u2019s congressional consultations was backed by Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who said this morning on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe that he hadn\u2019t been briefed by the Obama administration on this issue since 2011.\n\n\n\nFeinstein and Chambliss expressed frustration that they had not been warned in advance about the exchange, not only because forewarning had been demanded by Congress in previously-signed laws, but because they had worked with the White House in the past.\n\n\u201cWe spent a lot of time on it. This was not a cursory thing,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cGiven the past briefings and concerns that we had addressed\u2026I strongly believe that we should have been consulted.\u201d\n\nBut at least in Feinstein\u2019s case, the administration may have had a reason to keep her out of the loop. In March 2012 with Josh Rogin\u2014then with Foreign Policy magazine\u2014Feinstein accidentally acknowledged the negotiations, appearing to disclose classified information about a potential Bergdahl deal (Rogin also reported that the White House briefed eight senators, including Feinstein, on a potential deal in Jan. 2012).\n\n\n\nBut while Congress may have been kept in the dark about the possibility of a prisoner exchange, they were kept well-informed about Bergdahl himself. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a week that went by that we didn\u2019t get a briefing\u201d on the soldier\u2019s whereabouts, Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, told the Idaho Statesman.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, neither Feinstein nor Chambliss put much stock in the Obama administration\u2019s claims that Bergdahl\u2019s medical condition necessitated a prompt exchange.\n\nFeinstein said that the last assessment of Bergdahl\u2019s health had been made in December.\n\n\u201cHe was undernourished, not necessarily malnourished,\u201d she said. \u201cSo unless something catastrophic happened, there is no reason to believe he was in instant danger.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:40.597+0000"}

His criticism of John McCain barely seemed to register as anything other than the media blowing a single comment out of proportion.\n\n\u201cPeople make statements and Trump is Trump. That didn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d said John Doyle, a Vietnam veteran who is also the vice president of the Sun City Republicans, who will remain neutral in the primary. \u201cHe\u2019s used to pushing back at people and maybe not in the best light. But deep down I don\u2019t doubt what he thinks about John McCain.\u201d\n\nWilliam Hertling, 70, served in the Army from 1963 to 1965, considers himself an independent after giving up on both political parties years ago. Hertling said he\u2019s paying attention to Trump this time around.\n\n\u201cI felt what Trump said was maybe a punch below the belt, but I still understood him letting out his feelings about what McCain said about him,\u201d Hertling said. \u201cI do like the fact that he says what\u2019s on his mind rather than the politicians saying what you want to hear and not backing it up.\u201d\n\nMax Clements, who was drafted into the Army in 1957, saw Trump\u2019s bluntness as an attribute, not a detriment, even his comments about John McCain. \u201cEverybody\u2019s trying to take it out of context because he\u2019s leading in the polls,\u201d Clements said. \u201cTrump is not a politician and he tells it like it is. He\u2019s not going to owe anybody anything when he gets into office.\u201d\n\nIf anyone in the audience could have come to protest Trump, who sought five deferments from service in Vietnam, it would have been Patrick McGowan, a war hero by any definition.\n\nMcGowan volunteered for the Army in 1969 as the war raged in Vietnam, serving in country as a \u201ctunnel rat,\u201d crawling through underground tunnels in search of American POWs. It was brutally dangerous work that left him with three gunshot wounds to the chest and a Purple Heart, a Silver Star, and a Bronze Star.\n\nBut McGowan had come to support Trump.\n\n\u201cI truly like how strong-minded he is,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is actually for the veterans. He was not putting the veterans down. Why do they keep harping on it? Trump will change Washington and the V.A. and we need it.\u201d\n\nIf Trump\u2019s rival Republicans were hoping that his McCain outburst would be the beginning of the end of the summer of Trump, their hopes seem to be misplaced. The man who entered and departed Sun City to outstretched hands and cheers of thanks isn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nAnd if the GOP establishment is looking for somebody to blame for their current predicament\u2014 with 15 experienced Republican leaders trailing a man they\u2019ve written off as a carnival barker\u2014 they can blame themselves. While Republicans and Democrats alike have been obsessing over data, Super PACs, mega-donors, and any other way to game the system for a win in 2016, the outlandish man who built his name into a billion-dollar brand has figured out what brand many voters are looking for, and it\u2019s pretty much anything or anyone with no connection to Washington or the system that created it.\n\nTrump\u2019s key message was easy to lose Tuesday amid his opera of bombast, ego stroking and name calling, but he eventually laid it out for the audience in Sun City and they nodded in agreement as they took it in.\n\n\u201cThere is something happening here,\u201d he told the crowd, making sure they knew he was talking about himself as much as he was talking about them. \u201cWe are tired of being pushed around and led around by stupid people\u2026We need smart leadership, We need great leadership.

Moby-Dick?\n\nGovernment Bullies by Rand Paul.\n\nAccording to Gryphon Editions, a publishing company owned by Rick Ritter, Paul\u2019s 2012 lament about Big Government harming everyday people, co-written by his senior aide Doug Stafford and featuring a foreword by his father, Ron Paul, the former congressman and two-time presidential candidate, is among the greatest written works of our time.\n\n\n\nThe 262-page opus, of which three entire pages were proved to have been plagiarized from think tanks, has been featured in Gryphon Editions\u2019 \u201cClassics of Liberty Library\u201d alongside 133 books from people like George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, Cicero, Adam Smith, and John Locke.\n\n\u201cIf you are expecting any serious answers to this question, you are probably going to be disappointed.\u201d\n\nThese classics, Gryphon Editions boasts, are \u201cbooks that defined traditional American thought and are the foundations of American freedom.\u201d The publishing company specializes in leather-bound series, on topics ranging from science to law, ancient classics, and conservatism.\n\n\u201cThese books are designed to last generations,\u201d the company says on its website. \u201cDevelop your understanding of the philosophical and historical basis of liberty in order to enable you to transmit the American way of life we enjoy to posterity.\u201d\n\nObtaining this understanding and posterity is easy, according to the website. \u201cThomas Paine\u2019s COMMON SENSE together with RIGHTS OF MAN is yours for the introductory offer price of $9.95 when you enroll as a member in the Classics of Liberty Library.\u201d\n\nGovernment Bullies delivers foundational elements of American thought through soaring prose like \u201cAs a U.S. senator, it is my job to keep an eye on what our government is up to\u2026But what our government is doing is not \u2018fine.\u2019 It\u2019s infuriating,\u201d and \u201cBut there is some hope on the judicial front, and there is promise that checks and balances might finally be imposed on the EPA.\u201d\n\nPeople who are interested in Government Bullies, according to Gryphon Editions\u2019 website, may also be interested in Capitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman, Socialism by Ludwig von Mises, and The Road to Serfdom by Friedrich Hayek.\n\nThe Daily Beast asked Stafford whether it struck him as odd that Government Bullies would be featured alongside works by the Founding Fathers and former United States presidents. \u201cIf you are expecting any serious answers to this question, you are probably going to be disappointed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Daily Beast\n\nPressed further, Stafford said, \u201cI don\u2019t really have any feelings about who puts the book out or in what form. I\u2019m just glad people have read it.\u201d He then referenced the film Anchorman: \u201cI personally have many leather-bound books, and my house smells of rich mahogany.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously I have no further comment,\u201d he added.\n\nGryphon Editions did not respond to a query about its inclusion of Paul\u2019s work in the \u201cClassics of Liberty Library.\u201d The Kentucky senator, while not the only modern political figure in the \u201cLibrary\u201d\u2014Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush are also in there\u2014is the only current presidential prospect to find himself listed alongside Milton Friedman and George Washington.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly not for lack of books to include.\n\nIn the last few years, it seems the majority of likely Republican candidates have put out books. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush co-wrote 2013\u2019s Immigration Wars, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker released Unintimidated in 2013, former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum put out American Patriots in 2012, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio published his autobiography, American Son, in 2012. (As BuzzFeed\u2019s McKay Coppins reported in March, none of these books have generated much interest, despite large advances paid to the authors.)\n\nOn Tuesday, it was announced that in 2015 Paul would be coming out with his third book. (A year before Government Bullies, he published The Tea Party Goes to Washington.) The title was not made public, though the senator suggested to the Louisville Courier-Journal in June that it might be called Beyond Partisanship.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:41.315+0000"}
{"entityId": 1962, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Republican losses in the Golden State have reached a crisis point. A comeback is possible\u2014if the party\u2019s willing to work for it.\n\nConsider this state: unemployment is the fourth worst in the nation. When the current incumbent Democratic governor first held the position, 78 percent of the residents rated the state as \u201cone of the best places to live.\u201d Now that\u2019s plummeted to 43 percent. The state\u2019s leading poll finds \u201cBy a 54 percent to 35 percent margin, most voters say they prefer lower taxes and fewer government services to higher taxes and more government services.\u201d A leading Democratic candidate for statewide office, a prominent gun control activist, was recently arrested for allegedly trying to sell M-16s and rocket launchers. Yes, rocket launchers.\n\nNow given the above scenario, it would be reasonable to think that Republicans might have at least a decent shot in what looks to be an excellent Republican year. But this is California and Republicans are getting killed.\n\nRepublicans in California are like heirs to a vast fortune who have squandered their riches. There was a time, not very long ago, when Republicans were a vital political force steering the direction of California. Of California\u2019s 18 governors in the 20th century, 14 were Republican. From 1952 to 1968, the state went Republican in four out of five Presidential races. It launched Nixon, Reagan, the great populist property tax revolts. In 2003, the public was so angry with Democrat Governor Gray Davis that they recalled him, replacing him with Republican Arnold Schwazenneger.\n\nThat seems like another era.\n\nNow Republicans are facing the strong possibility that on June 3, the candidate who faces Jerry Brown will stumble into a general election with under 20 percent of the vote. There are no statewide officeholders.\n\nCalifornia has long served as the national launching ground for trends, both large and small, from the dominance of freeways and indoor shopping malls to Apple, Google and yoga. So the most frightening question for national Republicans is the most obvious: is what is happening in California foretelling the future of the national Republican Party?\n\nIn 2012, Barack Obama carried 72 percent of California Hispanics (PDF), about his national average. But in California Hispanics comprise 23 percent of the electorate versus just over 12 percent nationally. If you lose 72 percent of 12 percent, you\u2019ve got a real problem; if you lose 72 percent of 23 percent, you have a crisis. And it gets worse: Asians, not Hispanics, are now the fastest growing immigrant group in California at just over 55 percent of all immigrants. And Asians voted at even higher percentages for Obama than Hispanics: 79 percent in California.\n\nThat\u2019s bleak.\n\n\u201cRepublicans in California are now playing the role of swing voters helping to decide which Democrat will win,\u201d says Bill Carrick, a Democratic political consultant who moved to California years ago from South Carolina. \u201cThey are losing the definition of a governing party.\u201d\n\nThis Republican decline is in spite of California\u2019s negative economic climate that continues to drive great jobs out of the state. In Los Angeles, where there is a hot Congressional race to replace retiring Henry Waxman, Toyota just announced plans to move 3,000 jobs to Texas. That prompted Democratic candidate Matt Miller to attack one of his opponents, state senator Ted Lieu, who represents the area with the Toyota facility: \u201cHow can it be that a relocation of one of our district\u2019s major employers caught state Sen. Ted Lieu and other public officials by surprise?\u201d Miller demanded.\n\nMiller, who is a columnist, radio show host and business consultant, is the sort of Democrat who is, for Republicans, well, dangerous. While Waxman plays to the stereotype of a 1960s liberal, Miller (whom I know and on whose radio show I\u2019ve appeared a couple of times) doesn\u2019t seem to feel the need to pretend that the all is well in the Obama era. After eight years of President Obama, \u201cvirtually every measure of a good society that progressives care about (save for expanded health coverage) will be going in the wrong direction,\u201d Miller wrote in his last column for the Washington Post.\n\nWhile that may seem obvious given the basic facts\u2014fewer full time jobs, 43% more Americans on food stamps, decline in household income \u2014it\u2019s an acknowledgement of reality that appeals to independent voters. And it\u2019s from the rapidly growing pool of independent voters from which the Republican party of California must rebuild.\n\nOver the last ten years, California Democrats have stayed fairly constant at 44 percent, while Republicans have declined from around 35 percent to under 30 percent. Independents have surged from 15 percent to over 20 percent. It\u2019s a lot easier to reach those independent voters, which include a large number of lapsed Republicans than a base of Democratic voters, many of whom have never voted Republican.\n\nThe roadmap back for California Republicans is not complicated, it\u2019s just hard. As the current state party chair Jim Brulte said bluntly, Republicans \u201chave to leave their comfort zone.\u201d The former Republican minority leader in the state Senate sums it up, \u201cWe have ceded far too much territory to the Democrats because we\u2019ve failed to show up and even try to compete. And that\u2019s on us.\u201d\n\nOf course showing up is just a start. Once there, Republicans must do a better job of delivering a message that offers an attractive alternative to Democrats. In San Diego, Republican Kevin Faulconer won the San Diego mayor\u2019s race to replace disgraced Democratic mayor Bob Filner, who resigned. He\u2019s now the only Republican mayor in one of the top ten U.S. cities. Two state-wide Republicans have a good shot at winning in November, Pete Peterson for Secretary of State and Fresno Mayor Ashley Swearengin for Controller, both endorsed by the normally Democratic Los Angeles Times. If Republican Neel Kashkari can make it into the general with Jerry Brown, he\u2019d give Brown fits in debates and, who knows, running against Jerry Brown, the unpredictable is the best prediction.\n\nTo win you have to start winning and these very attractive candidates could help form a nucleus to rebuild the Party. Steve Poizner, whom I worked for when he ran for Governor in 2010, and who is currently leading UCLA\u2019s online educational venture, might possibly run again. Meg Whitman, who defeated Poizner in the primary and lost to Jerry Brown, could re-emerge. Both are tremendously talented, smart leaders who have built careers failing, adapting, and then succeeding. Don\u2019t count them out.\n\nAs Samuel Johnson said, \u201cwhen a man knows he is to be hanged \u2026 it concentrates his mind wonderfully.\u201d Out of this near-death experience, California Republicans might just find a way to help re-invigorate the party, knowing that more of the same is sure defeat. One out of eight Americans is a Californian and it\u2019s always drawn a disproportionate share of innovators and dreamers. Betting against California is never a good bet. In 10 years, this could be seen as one of those painfully necessary periods a Party had to go through to learn hard lessons and come out stronger.\n\nWhy not? In California, anything is possible.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:41.544+0000"}

DACA delays deportation for undocumented young people who arrived in the United States before their 16th birthday and have gone to school or served in the military.\n\nDACA reprieves are provided for a two year period, and conservative Republicans are hoping to end renewals to the program.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday evening, Republican leadership sat across from the 20 or so conservative Republicans who had objected to the border bill that was scheduled for a vote earlier in the day before it was eventually pulled due to lack of support.\n\nBy Friday, Rep. Michele Bachmann, one of the holdouts who had objected to the Thursday bill, was bragging to reporters that she and her conservative colleages had \"gutted\" that legislation.\n\nRep. Michele Bachmann said the bill would help \u201cstop the invasion of illegal foreign nationals into our country.\u201d\n\nBut the victory rings hollow. House members essentially have salvaged what was, even before the chaos, a largely symbolic gesture before a month-long recess period. With the Senate already adjourned, the bill will not be addressed until the fall. Rather than allowing House GOP lawmakers to go home and tell their constituents that they had acted on the border crisis, the confusion of this week\u2019s Congressional drama served merely to reemphasize the deep divisions in the Republican Party.\n\nCongress voted Friday on two separate planks related to the border crisis.\n\nFirst, lawmakers voted on and passed a bill authorizing nearly $700 million to address the surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the border, along with $35 million for a National Guard deployment. They then voted on a bill to halt DACA renewals, meaning that a half million individuals could be subject to deportation once their two-year reprieve from deportations expires.\n\nRepublicans had been confident that the new language would pass the House. The conservative Republicans who forced changes to the bill appeared triumphant after a Friday morning Republican all-hands meeting.\n\nRep. Steve King of Iowa said he was very glad \u201cthe things he offered to fix the bill\u201d were adopted. \u201cThe president cannot make up immigration law on his own, he can\u2019t create work permits out of thin air, he\u2019s got to abide by the constitution.\u201d\n\nBachmann, calling the votes on the border crisis \u201carguably the most monumental vote that we will take in this entire term,\u201d said that the bill would be effective in \u201cstopping the invasion of illegal foreign nationals into our country.\u201d\n\nBut there remained some conservative holdouts, who objected over technical details about how the bills will be voted on, and how rushed the process was.\n\nRep. Mo Brooks, a congressman from Alabama, told The Daily Beast he remains a \u201cno\u201d because members of Congress will be forced to vote even before they\u2019ve had a chance to study the legislative language closely.\n\nRep. John Fleming, a conservative Republican from Louisiana, said he was worried about the votes happening in two stages, rather than as part of one package. \u201cThere are those who are more moderate in our conference who actually don\u2019t want to see an end to DACA,\u201d he said. \u201cSo as a result of that they could theoretically ... vote against or just not vote at all when it comes to DACA. If we only fix the border, or at least put money on the border and do nothing about DACA, we only make the problem worse.\u201d\n\nBrooks shared those views, saying that if the \u201cDACA bill were a part of the border bill, and it was one bill, the DACA provisions would be sufficient to cause me to vote for the bill. \u2026 The border legislation in and of itself is not very effective ... and it\u2019s very costly.\u201d\n\nThe House-passed border legislation now heads to a Senate that is already in recess for the summer, and stands little to no chance of ever becoming law.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:41.780+0000"}

PunditFact checks it out.\n\nDid foreign interests curry favor with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by paying huge speaking fees to her husband?\n\nThat\u2019s the question raised in the forthcoming book Clinton Cash by author and political consultant Peter Schweizer. On the Sunday shows, Schweizer said that while his research uncovered no proof of a quid pro quo between foreign interests and the 2016 Democratic frontrunner, the evidence does suggest a troubling trend.\n\n\u201cWhen you ever have an issue of the flow of funds to political candidates, whether that's to their campaigns, whether that's to private foundations, whether that's to their spouse, is there evidence of a pattern of \u2014 of favorable decisions being made for those individuals?\u201d Schweizer said on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cAnd I think the \u2014 the point that we make in the book is that there is a troubling pattern.\u201d\n\nSchweizer pointed to a few examples, including the sale of a uranium company backed by Clinton financial supporters to a Russian company. The sale required approval of a U.S. government board that includes representatives from nine agencies, including the Department of State.\n\nAnother piece of circumstantial evidence offered by Schweizer: Of the 13 times Bill Clinton received $500,000 or more in speaking fees, 11 came while his wife was secretary of state.\n\nPunditFact can\u2019t fact-check Schweizer\u2019s \u201ctroubling pattern,\u201d but we did want to look at the specific claim about Bill Clinton\u2019s speaking fees. That rates True .\n\nIn 2014, the Washington Post analyzed Clinton\u2019s speaking fees and found the former president made at least $104 million between 2001 through 2012. More than half of that income came from speeches in foreign countries.\n\nTo find out more, we turned to Hillary Clinton\u2019s federal financial disclosure forms, made available by the Center for Responsive Politics, a research group that tracks money in politics. Because Hillary Clinton held federal positions from the time they left the White House in 2001 through 2012, financial information for both Clintons is available for all those years.\n\nIncome information on the financial disclosure forms supports Schweizer\u2019s claim. We indeed found 13 speeches between 2001 and 2012 in which Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 or more. All but two occurred after January 2009, when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. You can see the full list at PunditFact.com .\n\nNewt Gingrich went even further than Schweizer on Sunday, saying foreign donations accepted by the Clinton Foundation were \u201cclearly illegal.\u201d\n\n\"The Constitution says you can't take this stuff,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cWe have federal laws that say you can't take this stuff. If this was any person but Hillary Clinton, they'd be under indictment right now for a clearly straightforward problem.\u201d\n\nGingrich is referencing a part of the Constitution known as the Emoluments Clause. But he\u2019s going too far by claiming that the Clinton Foundation donations are \u201cclearly illegal.\u201d PunditFact rates that claim Mostly False .\n\nThe Emoluments Clause, found in Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, reads in part:\n\n\"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\"\n\nThe framers came up with this clause to prevent the government and leaders from granting or receiving titles of nobility and to keep leaders free of external influence.\n\nWe asked seven different constitutional law experts on whether the Clinton Foundation foreign donations were \u201cclearly illegal\u201d and a violation of the Emoluments Clause.\n\nWe did not reach a consensus with their responses, though a majority thought the layers of separation between the foundation and Hillary Clinton work against Gingrich.\n\nThe American system often distinguishes between public officers and private foundations, \u201ceven if real life tends to blur some of those distinctions,\u201d said American University law professor Steve Vladeck. Vladeck added that the Emoluments Clause has never been enforced.\n\n\u201cI very much doubt that the first case in its history would be because a foreign government made charitable donations to a private foundation controlled by a government employee\u2019s relative,\u201d he said. \u201cGingrich may think that giving money to the Clinton Foundation and giving money to then-Secretary Clinton are the same thing. Unfortunately for him, for purposes of federal regulations, statutes, and the Constitution, they\u2019re formally \u2014 and, thus, legally \u2014 distinct.\u201d\n\nRobert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas constitutional law professor who worked in the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel from 1989 to 2003, also called Gingrich\u2019s link between Clinton and the foreign governments\u2019 gifts to the Clinton Foundation as \u201cimplausible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is that we establish corporate bodies like the Clinton Foundation because the law endows these entities with a separate and distinct legal personhood,\u201d Delahunty said.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:42.045+0000"}

Who will blink first?\n\nSenate Democrats took a beating in the 2014 election, but they\u2019ve returned to Washington, D.C. ready to punch back.\n\nLed by the bruised and battered leader Harry Reid, Democrats united to block a procedural debate on a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) while defunding President Obama\u2019s executive order on immigration. By a vote of 51-48 with one Republican joining the Democrats, the bill failed to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to allow Senate consideration and set up yet another standoff over immigration reform on Capitol Hill.\n\nReid, who has a black bruise covering much of his face and a patch over his eye, proclaimed before the vote that he would not accept anything besides a \u201cclean\u201d DHS appropriations bill without the controversial rider. \u201cIf [Republicans] want a debate on immigration starting tomorrow, let\u2019s do it tomorrow, \u201cReid said. \u201cBut not at the express determination of Republicans who are holding hostage homeland security.\u201d\n\nThe impasse was set up with the compromise over the \u201cCromnibus\u201d in December. That bill was a compromise measure between Senate Democrats and House Republicans, which enabled most of the government to be funded for 2015. However, with many conservatives revolting over Obama\u2019s November executive order and hoping to use a potential government shutdown as leverage to reverse it, the compromise was to leave the DHS funded for only two months and kick the can down the road. The idea is that then conservatives could have their fight over Obama\u2019s executive order without bringing down the entire government.\n\nIn the past two months, though, the political climate has been greatly altered. With the terrorist attacks in Paris on the newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket, along with the continued savage murder of hostages by ISIS, funding for Homeland Security has become a much more sensitive issue. As Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat who attacked Obama\u2019s executive order at the time, told reporters, \u201cI think it is going to be very hard to justifying shutting down DHS with all the other countries that are experiencing attacks right now.\u201d She argued that the only way forward was for the Senate to pass \u201ca clean bill.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, funding for the Department of Homeland Security is scheduled to expire at the end of February.\n\nIn contrast, Republicans went after Democrats for blocking debate. Marco Rubio expressed his disappointment that Reid wouldn\u2019t even allow the Senate to move forward on debate. \u201cAt some point we have to address it,\u201d said the Florida Republican. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow the Department of Homeland Security, which is essential for the national security of this country, to go unfunded.\u201d\n\nThe question is who will blink first; and Senate Republicans don\u2019t seem inclined to make any compromises for now. In his press conference Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell heaped scorn on Reid\u2019s stance, \u201cI think it\u2019s a rather honestly absurd position to say we object to the bill but don\u2019t want debate the bill or change the bill.\u201d\n\nThe problem for Senate Republicans in the long term is that en if they make a deal, it still has to pass the House. In order to pass a compromise, Speaker John Boehner would have to defy the conservatives in his caucus yet again and push through a measure to fund the DHS relying heavily on Democrats. One possible concession would be for Boehner to move forward with a planned lawsuit against the president over his executive order\u2013while allowing the DHS to be funded. Although it\u2019s unlikely this will satisfy immigration hawks who see the White House\u2019s actions as blatantly unconstitutional, it would at least avoid a partial government shutdown\n\nIn the meantime, funding for the Department of Homeland Security is scheduled to expire at the end of February.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:42.272+0000"}

Here comes the Great Wall of Trump.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a wall,\u201d Donald Trump told moderator John Dickerson Sunday on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be a great wall. And, by the way, Mexico will pay for it. It\u2019s going to a great wall, because I know how to build. And it\u2019s not going to cost nearly as much as what they\u2019re saying for a crummy wall.\u201d\n\nThe GOP front-runner has no use for crummy walls. Crummy policies advocating repeal of the 14th Amendment and an end to birthright citizenship, yes. But crummy walls, no. It will even have a \u201cvery big, very beautiful door\u201d for people we want to let back in.\n\nTrump insists he was just kidding when he suggested during a campaign stop that the giant wall he promises to build on the 1,954-mile-long border with Mexico might one day bear his name.\n\nBut after two months of watching Trump the presidential candidate, Americans should have learned this much: When it comes to promoting his brand, Trump never kids.\n\nSo the Great Wall of Trump it is. The only thing left to decide is the exact size of the enormous letters spelling out \u201cTRUMP\u201d and whether they will face the U.S. or Mexico side.\n\nActually, there are a few other pesky details to work through. They come from a place I like to call: the real world.\n\nFor instance, those 1,954 miles cover just about every sort of terrain you can imagine\u2014valley, mountain, desert, river, Indian reservation, private land, state property. Ever try to build a wall on a river, or atop an Indian burial ground, or through the library of a state university? It\u2019s tricky. And once the environmentalists and the EPA get involved, it\u2019s nearly impossible.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that no one seems to know what it would cost. In the last six years, estimates for building a fence\u2014which is probably much cheaper than building a wall\u2014have ranged wildly from $1 million per mile to $15 million per mile, depending on where the fence goes. At that price, fencing for 2,000 miles would cost between $2 billion and $30 billion.\n\nCurrently, about a third of the border already has fencing, mostly in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. But building a wall probably means starting from scratch.\n\n\u201cGo ahead, folks. Knock yourselves out. Build, baby, build.\u201d\n\nUndeterred, Trump seems intent on building what could well be the Taj Majal of border walls.\n\nStill, I have yet more bad news for the emperor. After all the fuss, and what you can bet would be one unbelievably lavish grand opening, the Great Wall of Trump likely wouldn\u2019t do such a great job of stopping illegal immigration.\n\nYou see, walls won\u2019t do wonders. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard from border patrol agents each of the half dozen times I\u2019ve visited the U.S.-Mexico border\u2014in Arizona, Texas, and California. They don\u2019t mind the additional fencing, and many of them will tell you that it does tend to slow down some would-be border crossers and give border patrol agents more time to get to the scene.\n\nBut they just wish Congress didn\u2019t waste so much time and political capital on debating the fence as if it were a cure-all for illegal immigration.\n\nAs one especially wise border patrol agent once told me, \u201cThere is no barrier known to man that will stop someone who has traveled hundreds of miles to feed his family. He will go over, under, or around anything you put up.\u201d\n\nThe only way to put a dent in illegal immigration is to penalize employers. No jobs, no illegal immigrants. The trouble is, in both political parties, there is no appetite for getting tough with a group of people who can utter six little words that strike fear into the hearts of politicians everywhere: \u201cI\u2019m stopping payment on the check.\u201d\n\nIn fact, if our earlier attempts at building border walls and fencing in the early 1990s is any guide, a big wall might even backfire and make the problem worse.\n\nAs has been documented by noted border experts such as sociology professor Douglas Massey of Princeton and Wayne Cornelius of University of California, San Diego\u2014both of whom have studied the border for as long as Trump has bought real estate\u2014walls don\u2019t just keep people out but also pen people in.\n\nSo those 11 million undocumented immigrants who are already here won\u2019t feel so inclined to go home to Mexico for Christmas or Mother\u2019s Day, like they used to, and where there was always a chance that some of them would stay. Now, unsure that they\u2019d be able to return if they left, they\u2019ll just resign themselves to putting down roots and staying on this side of the border.\n\nThus, a measure intended to keep out additional Mexican immigrants might just ensure that we keep the ones who are already here.\n\nStill, I don\u2019t expect facts, cost, logic, research, or past experience to dissuade Trump or his supporters. They\u2019re stuck on the idea of building a giant, expensive, gaudy, white elephant wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. And nothing will pull them off.\n\nSo what more can I say, except: \u201cGo ahead, folks. Knock yourselves out. Build, baby, build.\u201d\n\nOnce you construct your precious wall, and immigrant smugglers respond by tripling their fees and building tunnels underneath it (or simply leasing drug tunnels that are already there) to stay in business, you can admit you were wrong, put aside simplistic solutions and think more deeply about how to deal with illegal immigration.\n\nTo show there are no hard feelings, I\u2019ll even recommend a company with some expertise in that area. Let\u2019s see. Where did I leave that business card? Oh yeah, here it is.\n\nPresident Trump should call the Golden State Fence Company in Riverside, California. Launched in 1984, the company\u2014which has contracted with the U.S. government to build fences on the U.S.-Mexico border\u2014at one point had as many as 750 employees and generated annual revenue of about $150 million.\n\nOh, wait. There is no more Golden State Fence Company. The outfit is now called Fenceworks, Inc. That\u2019s because the Golden State Fence Company was busted in 1999, 2004, and 2005 for hiring illegal immigrants\u2014to build the fencing that was meant to keep out illegal immigrants.\n\nImmigration agents estimate that as much as 50 percent of the company\u2019s workforce were in the country illegally. Owner Melvin Kay took a plea bargain where he paid $5 million and spent six months under house arrest, during which time he continued to bid on government contracts.\n\nWhen punishing those who employ illegal immigrants, that\u2019s how we roll. Americans talk loudly but carry a small stick. And the problem continues.\n\nSo, go ahead. Build your dang wall. Feel better. And nothing will change.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:42.533+0000"}
{"entityId": 1967, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "New York blinks in the face of uncertainty and bans hydraulic fracturing. The reasons may be a lot more boring than you think.\n\nThe state of New York has banned fracking\u2014for now, anyway. Environmentalists have cheered, the fracking industry has scowled, and for the most part, coverage of the decision has focused on the political factors weighing on Governor Andrew Cuomo: the timing of the report\u2019s release, six weeks after Cuomo won re-election; the governor\u2019s uncharacteristic \u201cI\u2019m just doing what the experts say\u201d rhetoric; and so on.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem many people have read the actual report (89 pages plus 95 more of endnotes and appendices), though. This is a shame, since it\u2019s a fascinating window into how uncertainty factors into environmental policy, and how the most mundane consequences may be the most dangerous.\n\nFirst, the shortest summary of A Public Health Review of High Volume Hydraulic Fracturing for Shale Gas Development (PDF) is: We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s safe or not.\n\nAs the title implies, the New York report is not a study, but a review of existing studies\u2014dozens of them, from around the country\u2014as well as conversations with officials in other states who are also studying the issue. In addition to the tens of detailed studies, the report identifies 13 comprehensive, systematic ones that might settle the matter once and for all. \u201cThese major study initiatives may eventually reduce uncertainties regarding health impacts of HVHF [fracking] and could contribute to a much more complete knowledge base for managing HVHF risks,\u201d the report says. \u201cHowever, it will be years before most of these major initiatives are completed\u201d\n\nSigh. Even the most eagerly anticipated study, the EPA\u2019s analysis of fracking\u2019s potential effects on drinking water, begun in 2011, is not due to be complete until 2016.\n\nIn the meantime, most of the detailed studies are incomplete in one way or another. For example, studies cited in the report have shown a higher incidence of birth defects for people living near drill sites. But the report notes that those people are also likely to be economically disadvantaged, which correlates with lower overall heath. Likewise, it\u2019s scary that water pollution from fracking might have an \u201celevated endocrine disrupting activity,\u201d but there too, the report says the data is uncertain.\n\nWhen it comes to environmental issues, conservatives tend to be the least conservative.\n\nIn short, the existing data makes fracking seem like a judgment call. A cynic might say that the report is like the movie Clue, perfectly set up for a multiplicity of endings. Is fracking presumed to be safe unless proven otherwise? Or are the risks so great that a temporary ban is necessary?\n\nThis report concludes the latter:\n\n\u201cWhile a guarantee of absolute safety is not possible, an assessment of the risk to public health must be supported by adequate scientific information to determine with confidence that the overall risk is sufficiently low to justify proceeding with HVHF in New York. The current scientific information is insufficient\u2026 Until the science provides sufficient information to determine the level of risk to public health from HVHF and whether the risks can be adequately managed, HVHF should not proceed in New York State.\u201d\n\nThat is an eminently plausible conclusion\u2014though it\u2019s easy to imagine the opposite one: that since there\u2019s no definitive proof that fracking is dangerous, we\u2019ll allow it to go on.\n\nThis is, more or less, the position of political conservatives, who have come down firmly on the side of the fracking industry. It\u2019s ironic that when it comes to environmental issues, Republicans tend to be the least conservative.\n\nThe most obvious example is climate change, where the \u201cconservative\u201d policy is to forge ahead with business as usual, despite the obvious risks of catastrophe. Well, we\u2019re not sure, they say, so let\u2019s keep doing the risky thing we\u2019re doing until we are.\n\nLikewise here. Yes, fracking may cause birth defects\u2014but we\u2019re not sure, so let\u2019s keep doing the risky thing we\u2019re doing until we are. It\u2019s odd that this position is called \u201cconservative,\u201d but there you have it.\n\nAt the same time, the favorite fears of the Left aren\u2019t quite right either. Probably the most infamous images of fracking are those of tap water catching fire\u2014the video for Sean Lennon\u2019s anti-fracking anthem \u201cDon\u2019t Frack My Mother\u201d uses them quite well. That can happen, according to the report, when (flammable) methane leaks out of fracking wells and into drinking water. But it is not actually as toxic as it seems (although, admittedly, it does seem pretty toxic). But those incidents are due to mistakes and leaks, not proper fracking procedures.\n\nActually, the most serious risks of fracking turn out to be a lot more boring: traffic from trucks, \u201cboomtown effects\u201d of sudden economic development, and particulate matter\u2014that\u2019s dust, to you and me. These seem like the weakest links in the report\u2014dust?!\u2014but, in fact, they turn out to be the strongest.\n\nThe petroleum industry has depicted fracking as a few antiseptic drills dug on peaceful farmland. Said one industry spokesperson, \u201cOur citizens in the Southern Tier [of New York] have had to watch their neighbors and friends across the border in Pennsylvania thriving economically. It\u2019s like they were a kid in a candy store window, looking through the window, and not able to touch that opportunity.\u201d\n\nIn fact, that candy store is heavy industry, with all the mess that entails. For example, the National Institute of Occupational Safety & Health has reported that \u201cthe occupational fatality rate among oil and gas industry workers is seven times higher than the average rate for all US industries.\u201d The main reason? Toxic dust\u2014the same dust kicked up by fracking rigs.\n\nAnd then there are the trucks. Each well requires 1,500\u20142,000 truck trips over the lifetime of the well. That is a lot of air pollution, noise, and yet more kicking up of dust.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re Sean Lennon, what are you going to put in your music video\u2014trucks? That\u2019s not interesting. Surely, what\u2019s scary about fracking is fire coming out of your kitchen faucet. That\u2019s what grabs attention.\n\nMoreover, trucks, dust, and boomtown stress are the effects of any large-scale industrial activity. Fracking, in this regard, is no different from gypsum mining, or some kinds of industrial agriculture.\n\nOn the other hand, if you think about it, those basic industrial effects can be the most devastating. I admit, I chuckled when I read the phrase \u201cboomtown effects\u201d in the New York report. But they are serious: what large-scale fracking does is change small farm towns into industrial sites. Low-wage workers, crime, pollution, Wal-Marts\u2014in fact, these \u201cboring\u201d effects of fracking are probably more serious than faucets on fire.\n\nAs the report itself suggests. The real risks of fracking aren\u2019t photogenic, but they would represent a highly un-conservative remaking of the rural heartland into what one \u201cfractivist\u201d has called Gasland.\n\nOn balance, New York\u2019s decision seems to be the prudent one, if not the most profitable. Or even the greenest\u2014while environmentalists hate fracking, it has decreased carbon emissions by decreasing reliance on coal and foreign oil. And given the current glut in fossil fuels, it might even be a better economic bet to wait a few years. It\u2019s certainly the most risk averse.\n\nIn that light, one might call Governor Cuomo\u2019s decision the conservative thing to do.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:43.066+0000"}
{"entityId": 1968, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Lone Star State has led a surprisingly progressive overhaul of its incarceration system. The story behind the bipartisan push that GOP contenders may be extolling come 2016.\n\nIt appears Rick Perry is going to run for president again in 2016.\n\nPerry, 65, will leave the governor\u2019s office next January after serving for 14 years, beginning in 2000, when George W. Bush resigned to prepare for the presidency. In recent months, Perry has appeared in both Iowa and South Carolina. At South by South West in Austin last month, Perry told Jimmy Kimmel \u201cAmerica is a great place for second chances.\u201d\n\nAs he creeps back onto the national stage, Perry\u2014who has overseen the executions of 268 people\u2014more executions than any other governor in United States history\u2014has brought with him an unlikely Lone Star State success story: prison reform.\n\nIn Texas, funneling money to special courts (like drug courts or prostitution courts), rehabilitation, and probation in an effort to make sure current offenders don\u2019t reoffend, instead of continuing to make room for more prisoners, has resulted in billions saved and dramatically lower crime rates. In just the last three years, Texas has shut down three prisons.\n\nThe conservative movement to reform prisons is not new. Republican governors in Georgia, Louisiana, Indiana, and Ohio have all made efforts in recent years to address growing incarceration rates. But it has largely remained on the periphery of the mainstream\u2014the stuff of columns and local reports that do nothing to sway the general public.\n\nThat very well might be changing now that it appears it could be a series of talking points for a mainstream Republican presidential prospect.\n\nBut prison reform in Texas has been a long time in the making, and despite what it sounds like, Perry was not the one leading the way.\n\nThe Dean of the Texas State Senate, John Whitmire, is one of the architects of prison reform in the state. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of strange to hear him,\u201d he said to me of Perry\u2019s prison-reform talk on the national stage. \u201cI don\u2019t know what his agenda is.\u201d\n\n***\n\nJohn Whitmire entered the Texas House of Representatives in 1972 as a 22-year-old dropout from the University of Houston (he went on to graduate and go to law school). Whitmire, a Democrat who says things like \u201cI\u2019m not some old cracker\u201d and was once alleged to have gotten a bartender fired for not serving him a second scotch while he was drunk, had an encounter with a criminal that would change Texas forever.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go into the state legislatures and say \u2018Hey, they did this in Vermont!\u2019 and everybody would go \u2018Oh, jeeze, they\u2019d do anything in Vermont!\u2019 But in Texas, they go \u2018Oh, they\u2019re serious about crime in Texas and they\u2019re not weenies, they\u2019re not goo-goos. They did this, it works, wow, OK.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn his deep drawl, Whitmire recalled being with his wife and 9-year-old daughter when they \u201cpulled in our garage on New Year\u2019s Eve in \u201892.\u201d Then, \u201cmy wife screamed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was getting out of the front of the car, and she was getting the dishes out of the back of the car, and she let out this blood curdling, gurgling scream.\u201d He raised his voice an octave, \u201c\u2018Oh, no, no!\u2019\n\n\u201cI ran the length of the car, and the guy put the gun in my face.\n\n\u201cHe was doing that for his drug habit\u2026 He got 25 years for holding me up; he ended up doing 12 of them\u2026 As I look back, I think that had a profound impression on me.\n\n\u201cOf course, I still think about it every night I pull in my garage. I always look around,\u201d he laughed.\n\nIn 1993, with Ann Richards as governor, Whitmire, who is today the longest-serving member of the Texas State Senate, was asked by Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock to join the criminal justice committee as chairman.\n\nThe appointment couldn\u2019t have come at a more perfect time for Whitmire. \u201cIt only makes sense to me that if you lock somebody up for armed robbery because they\u2019re supporting their drug habit, hopefully you get rid of their drug habit before you let them out\u2026 I was very motivated to fix the problem of bad guys robbing you in your garage for drug money,\u201d he told me, although he still had some reservations.\n\nWhen he assumed the chairmanship, Texas prisons \u201chad a revolving door. We had been caught off guard, or by surprise, by the influx of crack cocaine. It was kind of a phenomenon that overtook the country.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1980s, an oversupply of cocaine powder in the Dominican Republic and Bahamas caused the price of the drug to drop by 80 percent. Dealers in America responded by a selling solid, smokable form of cocaine\u2014crack\u2014in small quantities for as little as $2.50. By the mid-\u201980s, the cheap drug had spread like wildfire, and crime\u2014particularly violent crime\u2014rose sharply.\n\nFrom 1985 to 2005, the number of prisoners in Texas increased threefold, to 152,000 from 37,281, giving Texas the second-highest incarceration rate in the country.\n\n\u201cIn \u201893, we had 60,000 inmates in our prison system and 30,000 were backed up in the county jails, sleeping on the floor,\u201d Whitmire recalled. There were too many criminals and not enough space, so \u201cyou only served about one month for every year that you were sentenced.\u201d\n\nDuring his first few years as chairman, Whitmire said, \u201cI kind of surrounded myself with a lot of smart people. Prosecutors, judges, crime victims, defense attorneys. The first thing we did\u2014we came up with state jails. We needed some capacity real quick. State jails were for low-level offenders, [and they are] heavy on rehabilitation. We built about 14,000 of them, and [they took] care of our nonviolent offenders,\u201d leaving room for violent offenders in maximum-security prisons.\n\nThe progress Whitmire and the committee was making came to a screeching halt when George W. Bush became governor in 1995. Bush, a recovered alcoholic, didn\u2019t believe that money should be going to rehabilitate addicted criminals. \u201c[He] came along\u2026 and said \u2018we don\u2019t need that because I quit drinking on my own,\u2019 which honestly was foolish, because he didn\u2019t have that bad a drinking problem or he wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop on his own. He started cutting back on some of our treatments.\u201d During his governorship, Bush oversaw the construction of 38 prisons.\n\nBush Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, formerly a Democrat who served as a state representative, assumed the governorship in 2000, but Whitmire\u2019s luck still didn\u2019t improve. As late as 2003, he told me, his efforts were being undermined by budget cuts, which slashed rehabilitation funding.\n\nIt would take Whitmire joining forces with an unlikely friend for the Texas criminal justice system to change.\n\n***\n\nThe same year Whitmire became chairman of the criminal justice committee, Jerry Madden joined the Texas House of Representatives.\n\nMadden, an engineer originally from Iowa, grew up in a political family. \u201cMy mother was a longtime elected clerk of a municipal court in Iowa, so I sort of got my first tests in politics very early with my mother, going out and walking door to door and getting petitions signed when I was a little kid.\u201d\n\nMadden moved to Texas in 1971, became his precinct chairman in 1972, his county Republican chairman in 1984, and when redistricting opened up a seat, he ran for the legislature in 1992.\n\n\u201cIn January 2005, the Speaker [Tom Craddick] calls me in and says, \u2018Jerry, you\u2019re going to be chairman of corrections,\u2019 and I said what you always say to the Speaker, which is \u2018Thank you for the opportunity and it\u2019s a great honor to be chairman of your committee,\u2019\u201d Madden recalled. \u201cBut under my breath, I\u2019m saying \u2018Oh God, what did I do to deserve this?\u2019\u201d\n\nMadden said he had next to no knowledge about criminal justice. \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer. I\u2019d never been interested in corrections. My district doesn\u2019t have any prisons in it\u2014it has a couple jails, but no prisons. I had never been on that committee, never had a bill before that committee\u2026 I didn\u2019t even know how much a prison cost at that time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, I asked the question that was the second most important question of my life,\u201d Madden told me. \u201cAnd that was, \u2018Mr. Speaker, what do you want me to do? And he gave me the eight words that changed my life. He said, \u2018Don\u2019t build new prisons\u2014they cost too much.\u2019\u201d\n\n(The most important question? \u201cWhen I asked my wife to marry me.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI started looking around, and said, \u2018Who knows anything about this stuff?\u2019\u201d Madden said. \u201cYou\u2019d be shocked to know that in the legislature, there are not very many people who know a lot about the prison system, and that\u2019s true in every state\u2014not just Texas.\u201d\n\nMadden recalled hearing one name over and over.\n\n\u201cI wandered across the hall one day in late January and sat down with John,\u201d Madden said. \u201cHe\u2019s of the other party than I am. He\u2019d been chairman of the justice committee\u2014he\u2019d been at it for a long time. John had a lot of great knowledge on the subject and he and I just bonded absolutely on this issue, just perfectly.\u201d\n\nThey started digging into the facts. How do people get to prison? Where do they come from? \u201cHow do I keep from building new prisons?\u201d Madden said.\n\nThey made their first attempt in 2005, with a probation bill that expanded specialty courts (courts specific to certain problems: drug courts, prostitution courts, military courts, etc.), reduced time on probation, and expanded the number of probation offices in the state. \u201cWe got it passed out of the Senate, got it passed out of the House\u2014and the governor vetoed it,\u201d Madden said.\n\nMadden called Perry\u2019s veto, \u201cthe best thing that ever happened to us.\u201d Instead of focusing too much on one area, like probation, Madden said they decided to reassess \u201cthe whole cycle\u201d to see where they could avoid having violent offenders sent off to prison, released, and then sent right back when they reoffended.\n\n***\n\nAs Whitmire and Madden plotted in Texas, the idea was sprouting roots across the country.\n\nThink tanks like the Texas Public Policy Foundation and people like Americans for Tax Reform founder Grover Norquist began to see the flaws in the \u201clock \u2018em up\u201d philosophy of Republicans past.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, the politics [of prison reform] were that conservatives said \u2018tough on crime\u2019 and \u2018the longer you put people in prison, the better,\u2019\u201d Norquist told me. \u201cOver time, the cost of prisons, the cost of the judicial system, the length of some of the mandatory minimums that were being thrown out, got to be such that conservatives started saying \u2018Wait a minute, if we\u2019re trying to reduce crime, are we doing this in the most cost-effective way? Are there better ways to approach this?\u2019\u201d\n\nEven Newt Gingrich did a 180. As a congressman in 1992, he promised to take steps to build more prisons.\n\nNow, he sees things differently. In a 2011 Washington Post op-Ed, Gingrich wrote \u201cThere is an urgent need to address the astronomical growth in the prison population, with its huge costs in dollars and lost human potential\u2026 We can no longer afford business as usual with prisons. The criminal justice system is broke, and conservatives must lead the way in fixing it.\u201d\n\nNorquist, who has taken his advocacy for prison reform on the road, adds that the fact that these reforms began in Texas is a unique advantage. \u201cYou can\u2019t go into the state legislatures and say \u2018Hey, they did this in Vermont!\u2019 and everybody would go \u2018Oh, jeeze, they\u2019d do anything in Vermont!\u2019 But in Texas, they go \u2018Oh, they\u2019re serious about crime in Texas and they\u2019re not weenies, they\u2019re not goo-goos. They did this, it works, wow, OK.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe left doesn\u2019t take this seriously,\u201d Norquist mused. \u201cThey\u2019ve left the entire area of reform to the right\u2026 [the left] can\u2019t talk about prison reform for 15 seconds before [they] want to yell \u2018racist\u2019 and [they] want to get rid of the death penalty. Once you say those two things, nobody\u2019s listening to you anymore! People just shut down as soon as you pull that crap.\n\n\u201cThis is a zone that is very interesting, where only the right can fight\u2014the left can show up and vote for it, but they can\u2019t be the first movers on it.\u201d\n\n***\n\nTexas was basking in the glow of an $8.7 billion budget surplus in 2007, when the Legislative Budget Board approached lawmakers with some startling figures. People were moving to Texas in record numbers, and more people meant more criminals.\n\nIt was projected that by 2012, the state would need 17,000 new prison beds (\u201dbeds\u201d is the term used to classify all of the expenses for an individual inmate\u2014the actual prison bed, three meals a day, electricity, etc.). The beds would require the construction of three new prisons, and the cost would be about $2 billion. Nobody blinked\u2014nobody, that is, except Whitmire and Madden.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018No, there\u2019s a better way to do it,\u2019\u201d Whitmire recalled. \u201cThere ought to be a requirement that you release a better person than the one you receive.\u201d\n\nInstead of funding the new prisons, they suggested allocating $241 million for treatment programs, both in and out of prison, and the creation of specialty courts. Gov. Perry signed on.\n\nAccording to Texas Department of Public Safety statistics, from 2007 to 2008 Texas saw a 5 percent decline in murders, a 4.3 percent decline in robberies, and a 6.8 percent drop in rapes. In those same years, Right on Crime, a conservative think tank devoted to criminal justice reform, reports the number of parolees convicted of a new crime fell 7.6 percent; the number of incarcerations dropped 4.5 percent.\n\nMadden said when he started as a legislator, \u201cIf you\u2019d have said [I\u2019d be a] nationally recognized expert on criminal justice, I\u2019d have laughed at you.\u201d The success of his policies, he told me, are now his greatest accomplishment.\n\nIn September 2011, Texas (facing a budget shortfall) closed Central Unit in Sugar Land, the state\u2019s second oldest prison.\n\nIt was the first prison closed in Texas history. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt there are better uses for that land as development occurs,\u201d Whitmire was quoted as saying at the time. \u201cAnd there\u2019s also no doubt that if the [prison] population continues to drop, that we may have other opportunities to close other units that are more expensive or are in the wrong place.\u201d\n\nTwo other prison closures have followed the closing of Central Unit. \u201cWe\u2019ve shut three prisons in the last three years,\u201d Whitmire told me. \u201cShut two this last session, and I think we\u2019re still seeing a reduction in our prison population\u2014and no compromise to public safety. We\u2019re still really tough. Hell, we\u2019re executing someone tomorrow again.\u201d\n\n***\n\nIn early March, just outside Washington, Texas Gov. Rick Perry joined a panel at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) to talk about criminal justice reform.\n\nWearing his now-ubiquitous black-rimmed glasses and a rust-colored tie, Perry caught the CPAC audience off-guard with what he had to say.\n\n\u201cYou want to talk about real conservative governance?\u201d Perry asked. \u201cShut prisons down. Save that money.\u201d The crowd applauded, but seemed surprised that they were doing so.\n\nPerry was joined by former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik and Norquist, who noted \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect\u2014and certainly the establishment press doesn\u2019t expect\u2014to hear a discussion about criminal justice reforms and prison reform at CPAC. But, in point of fact, this is a big problem, it\u2019s an expensive problem, [and] it\u2019s a problem that creates more expensive problems.\u201d\n\nPerry, in a somewhat mischievous tone, assured the CPAC attendees that prison reform did not make him soft on crime. \u201cTexas is is still tough on crime. Don\u2019t come to Texas if you want to kill somebody.\u201d\n\nThe conservative politics of prison reform are good almost any way you look at it, because the issue has the unique advantage of appealing to both fiscal and social conservatives.\n\nBesides saving billions by not constructing new prisons, there are smaller numbers that add up. In Texas, the cost of locking someone up in a maximum-security prison is $50.04 a day; the cost of putting them on probation is just $3.63 a day.\n\nAt CPAC, Perry talked about prison reform as an opportunity to\u2014in a very Christian manner\u2014forgive. \u201cThe idea that we lock people up, throw them away forever, never give them a second chance at redemption isn\u2019t what America is about.\u201d\n\nLanhee Chen, former policy director for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign and a Hoover Institution fellow, told me the subject is \u201ccertainly something that\u2019s unique about [Perry] and is going to be an issue that he can talk about, particularly if he can run for president, as most suspect he will again.\u201d The success of Texas\u2019 policies will set Perry apart from other candidates, Chen said, and that is \u201csomething that he can use to his advantage, there\u2019s no question about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an issue where everybody is already there,\u201d Norquist explained. \u201cBut by the time we get to the caucuses, every single Republican running for president will be versed on this, and largely in the same place\u2026Some guys will be playing catch-up ball, but I do believe that, largely, this will become a consensus issue within the center right.\u201d And, Norquist told me, \u201cPerry has first-mover advantage. Everybody else is playing catch-up.\u201d\n\n***\n\nIn early April in Lubbock, Texas, Perry received the Governor of the Year Award \u201cfor his incredible work to transform the Texas criminal justice system,\u201d from the National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP). \u201cUnder his leadership,\u201d the group said, \u201cTexas has become a national and international model of reform.\u201d\n\nAlthough Perry will get credit for it, the reforms were not necessarily his. \u201cHe\u2019s supportive much of the time by his silence,\u201d Whitmire told me. \u201c[He\u2019s] supported [prison reform] by signing it [into law],\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t veto the laws that allowed those reforms to take place\u2026 but he wasn\u2019t, like, testifying for it.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Gov. Perry declined to comment for this article.\n\nThe first proposals for reform were vetoed by Perry in 2005. It wasn\u2019t until two years later that Perry signed off.\n\n\u201cA governor could have easily made the argument that [prison reform] is soft on crime\u2026 but he did not say that,\u201d said Vikrant Reddy, a senior policy analyst at Right on Crime. \u201cHe said, \u2018I think this makes sense, this is worth trying.\u2019 There are so many governors around the country who have for decades been calling those kind of reforms soft on crime, but that wasn\u2019t Governor Perry\u2019s take at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s only recently started talking about it,\u201d Whitmire noted. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s gotten enlightened!\u201d he added sarcastically.\n\nHe laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s an oxymoron.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:43.449+0000"}
{"entityId": 1969, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "When David Axelrod published his memoir he hoped it would be seen as a respectable political memoir. Naturally, everyone just wants the bitchiest dish.\n\nPresident Obama despises Maureen Dowd\u2014absolutely loathes the Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist. He\u2019s annoyed by Mitt Romney. And the president\u2019s messaging guru and top gun, David Axelrod, has little regard for Mark Penn, Hillary Clinton\u2019s erstwhile chief strategist.\n\nThose are a few of the gossipy take-aways from Believer: My Forty Years in Politics, Axelrod\u2019s hotly-anticipated (by political junkies) memoir that goes on sale today.\n\nYet those anecdotes represent just the sort of slicing and dicing of a serious work of political and personal history that Axelrod\u2014\u201cAxe\u201d to his friends\u2014sees as yet another example of the media\u2019s relentless marketing of sensationalism and triviality.\n\nSorry, Dave.\n\n\u201cMore than anything, this is what\u2019s terrible about modern media and how these books roll out,\u201d Axelrod says. \u201cI was determined to write a book that wasn\u2019t going to be characterized by some titillating nugget that had about a three-day half-life, but rather an entire story of my life and the conclusions that life has led me to. I wanted to write a book that people might want to read years from now and not just today\u2019s publication because they wanted to find out who had been knifing who.\u201d\n\nA lovely sentiment. But Axelrod, who likes to think of himself as a real-world idealist, surely knew not to get his hopes up.\n\nA couple of weeks from 60, he\u2019s a former shoe-leather newspaper reporter (in the political sump pit of Chicago, no less) who, during his four decades as a Democratic media consultant, has practiced the dark arts of campaigning with the best and the worst of them.\n\nBeliever\u2014which is not as slavishly cult-like as the title indicates, since it acknowledges that, yes, Barack Obama has rough edges and human imperfections\u2014tracks Axelrod\u2019s career from his early childhood in New York City, when, at age 5, he attended a rally featuring candidate John Fitzgerald Kennedy and caught the political bug.\n\n\u201cPresidential politics is like pole vaulting. Everyone can clear the early bar. But then the bar gets raised.\u201d\n\nIt recounts his precocious beginnings as a journalist, writing a political column at age 18 for the Hyde Park Herald; his parents\u2019 divorce and his father\u2019s subsequent suicide; and his guilty conscience over his own role as an often-absent parent, working on out-of-town campaigns while his wife, Susan, kept the family together as they confronted the challenge of raising a daughter seriously disabled by epileptic seizures.\n\n\u201cIt was painful to write some of that,\u201d Axelrod says, noting that he as he put together the family chapters, he sent them to his eldest son, Michael, as a cautionary note: \u201cDon\u2019t do to your kids what I did to you.\u201d\n\nThe book treats Hillary Clinton, a client before she was an opponent\u2014and today Axelrod\u2019s preferred 2016 presidential candidate\u2014with admiration and respect, even when her operatives are dissed, and even when Axelrod reports that she considered a post-2008 primary conversation with him, aboard the Obama campaign plane, about as welcome as a root canal.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s going to be the [Democratic] nominee, and I will strongly support her,\u201d says Axelrod, who claims that 2012 was his final campaign and that he has retired once and for all from political consulting; these days he presides over the Institute of Politics, which he founded in 2013 at his alma mater, the University of Chicago. \u201cShe\u2019s in a very strong position\u2014not to say that she\u2019s guaranteed anything,\u201d Axelrod says of Clinton. \u201cThe question\u2014and only she can answer it when she becomes a candidate\u2014is what kind of candidate she\u2019ll be.\u201d\n\nAxelrod continues: \u201cI thought she was not a very good candidate in 2007, when she was encased in this armor of inevitability. And she became a very compelling candidate in 2008 when she threw off that armor and threw caution to the winds, and really connected with people in a very visceral way about the struggles of their lives. And the fact that she herself looked vulnerable made her more accessible.\u201d\n\nOn the Republican side, Axelrod says Jeb Bush, with his relatively enlightened views on immigration and education reform, would be a strong general election contender \u201cif he can get through the primaries without being forced to make a Faustian bargain with the more extreme elements of his party.\u201d\n\nAxelrod is skeptical of the presidential buzz surrounding Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. \u201cSo he goes to Iowa and gives a good speech to a few hundred activists\u2026and he\u2019s the flavor of the month,\u201d he says. \u201cPresidential politics is like pole vaulting. Everyone can clear the early bar. But then the bar gets raised. And the reality is, how do you handle it when it gets really, really rough, when you\u2019re under constant scrutiny, when everything you say becomes an issue?\u201d\n\nAxelrod has had some recent personal experience along these lines with the release of his book. Even though his publisher, Random House subsidiary Penguin Press, tried to enforce a strict embargo on reporting about its content\u2014going so far as to require recipients of hardcovers to sign non-disclosure agreements\u2014it was entirely predictable that an outlet like the New York Daily\n\nNews would get its hands on an unauthorized early copy and highlight the nasty bits.\n\nThe most garish headlines generated by last week\u2019s leak involve a close Mitt Romney aide\u2019s fiery rebuttal to an anecdote from Election Night 2012. In Believer, Axelrod recounts the president\u2019s \u201cslightly irritated\u201d and \u201cunsmiling\u201d reaction to Romney\u2019s concession phone call.\n\nUpon hanging up, Axelrod writes, Obama told a group of aides witnessing his end of the conversation that the Republican candidate had just complimented Obama\u2019s \u201cgreat job of getting out the vote in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee.\u201d The president allegedly added: \u201cIn other words, black people. That\u2019s what he thinks this was all about.\u201d\n\nIn response, Romney\u2019s personal campaign aide\u2014who had arranged the phone call\u2014promptly called Axelrod a big fat fibber in suggesting that the former Massachusetts governor had made a veiled racial reference. \u201cI was so appalled that he just made that up,\u201d Garrett Jackson insisted. \u201cI hope it\u2019s David Axelrod that concocted this crazy line and not the president.\u201d\n\nIn his interview with The Daily Beast, Axelrod sticks to his story, and points out that other Obama operatives present during the phone call recalled the president\u2019s reaction in exactly the same way\u2014especially Campaign Manager Jim Messina, who tweeted: \u201cEvery word of @davidaxelrod mitt e-night call is true. I was standing with axe & POTUS. That\u2019s what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI admire his loyalty\u2014I have no beef with him,\u201d Axelrod says about Garrett Jackson\u2019s outburst. \u201cThere was no implication that Romney was trying to be ungracious. He was complimenting the campaign. This was at the end of a long battle and they each saw this through their own lens, and the president reacted\u2026He thought it was kind of a cramped way of analyzing what had just happened in the election. So I think this is just one of the kerfuffles in the run-up to a book release.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Axelrod\u2019s juiciest yarn\u2014at least for some the self-absorbed, self-dramatizing pundits who traffic in the journalism biz\u2014concerns a visit Maureen Dowd paid to the candidate on the 2008 Obama campaign plane.\n\n\u201cWhen we brought her to the front of the plane,\u201d Axelrod writes, \u201cObama proceeded to blister her for a previous column she had written. No one got under Barack\u2019s skin more than Maureen\u2026 He was patronizing and disrespectful\u2026After that awkward encounter, she seemed to take particular delight in psychoanalyzing Barack and belittling him in print, which only deepened his contempt\u2026 \u2018Why are you friends with her?\u2019 he would demand after Maureen sent one of her acid darts his way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAxe\u201d also makes short work of Clinton strategist and pollster Penn, currently Microsoft\u2019s chief strategy officer, whom he describes as \u201cbloodless and calculating\u201d during their brief stint toiling together, and tangling with each other, on Hillary\u2019s successful 2000 Senate race.\n\nPenn \u201csaw his mission as quashing any liberal impulses of the candidate or the campaign, and he justified himself with fuzzy polling numbers and smug self-assurance that made every conversation grating,\u201d he writes. \u201cI felt he spent as much time manipulating his clients as providing constructive counsel.\u201d\n\nAxelrod claims: \u201cI don\u2019t wish Mark ill\u2026The underlying premise of the book is I believe politics has meaning\u2026I believe politics is the way in which we organize ourselves to try and move the wheel of history and try to shape the future in a positive way. There\u2019s nobility in that calling.\u201d\n\nAxelrod adds, however, that Penn \u201crepresents a not-rare view that politics is really a business. It\u2019s about winning elections, that\u2019s the ultimate goal, and political consulting is about making as much money as you can make. In certain ways, Mark became a surrogate of a style of thinking about politics that I strongly object to.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:44.259+0000"}

Supplies have dried up. And ISIS is closing in on Mount Sinjar again.\n\nIn August, the Obama administration intervened to stop what it called a pending genocide of Yazidi minorities in Iraq. Now the U.S. is gone, but the genocide continues.\n\nThousands of Yazidis remain stranded and starving on Mount Sinjar while thousands more have been sold off into slavery by ISIS, according to Yazidi leaders, several of whom are in Washington to beg for urgent assistance.\n\nWhen President Obama announced U.S.-led airstrikes in Iraq in early August, he said the mission was twofold: to protect U.S. personnel in Erbil and to save the ethnic Yazidis from ISIS, who had fled from their villages, chased by ISIS, and were stranded on the mountain with no food, no supplies, and no protection.\n\n\u201cPeople are starving. And children are dying of thirst. Meanwhile, ISIL forces below have called for the systematic destruction of the entire Yazidi people, which would constitute genocide,\u201d said Obama. \u201cAnd when we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre, then I believe the United States of America cannot turn a blind eye. We can act, carefully and responsibly, to prevent a potential act of genocide. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing on that mountain.\u201d\n\nAt first, international airstrikes and humanitarian airdrops somewhat alleviated the Yazidi crisis and opened up an escape corridor for many Yazidis to flee. But in October, the United States turned to other parts of the battle, leaving the Yazidis largely to fend for themselves. ISIS has now surrounded Mount Sinjar again, trapping approximately 10,000 Yazidis there. Meanwhile, ISIS forces are taking over Yazidi villages near the mountain one after another, killing the men and selling the women and children into the slave trade.\n\n\u201cThe Yazidis are trapped on the mountain, surrounded by ISIS, and there is no pathway to reach them,\u201d Nuri Khalaf Elias, leader of the Hababa tribe in Sinjar, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThere is a shortage of food, there is little aid, and they are in a dire situation.\u201d\n\nElias is part of a large delegation of Yazidi leaders who came to Washington last week, led by Baba Sheikh Khurto Hajji Ismail, the leader of the Yazidi Supreme Religious Council. They met with senior White House and State Department officials and pleaded for the U.S. government and the U.S. military to turn their attention back to the Yazidi crisis. The delegation met with, among others, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, Undersecretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights Sarah Sewall, and Ambassador Luis CdeBaca, who leads the State Department\u2019s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.\n\n\u201cWe thank President Obama because he started the operation, but we were expecting he would not stop until clearing the area of ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur hostages, children, women, and girls, between 4,000 and 5,000 of them, have been captured by ISIS and sent to other areas. We need help to rescue these hostages,\u201d said Sameer Karto Babasheikh, the son of the Yazidi Supreme Religious Council leader. \u201cIn Mosul, they opened a market to sell Yazidi girls. Some of them ended up in Fallujah, some of them were taken to Saudi Arabia and Raqqa in Syria.\u201d\n\nOn the mountain, between 6,000 and 7,000 civilians and between 2,000 and 3,000 Yazidi fighters are still trapped and struggling to stay alive, cut off from any supply routes, the Yazidi leaders said. Since the airstrikes trailed off to a trickle in October, ISIS has taken over the five remaining Yazidi towns near Mount Sinjar, killing hundreds of civilians and abducting hundreds more.\n\nEven the humanitarian airdrops have halted. The Iraqi government provided two helicopters to deliver aid, but they are old and fly only once or twice a week, Babasheikh said. About 100 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are on the mountain, he added, but they don\u2019t engage ISIS. The extremist group continues to fight to take the mountain once and for all, and the situation on Mount Sinjar could go from dire to catastrophic within a couple of weeks, the Yazidi leaders said.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama promised that they are not going to let ISIS get any more land, that they are not going to let them get another genocide on the Yazidis. But this is going to be worse than in August,\u201d said Kamal Elias, a Yazidi activist who is part of the delegation. \u201cIf ISIS gets to the mountain, all of these people are going to be slaughtered, and then it\u2019s going to take years for the U.S. or anyone else to get them out of the mountain.\u201d\n\nFor the Yazidis, this ISIS attack is only the latest in a long history of Sunni Iraqi attempts to drive the Yazidis from their land and extinguish their religion in Iraq.\n\n\u201cMost of the ISIS members are from the towns around ISIS,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were our neighbors. We lived with them for hundreds of years. Now all of a sudden they are ISIS. They joined ISIS.\u201d\n\nThe Yazidis blame several parties for their plight. They blame the government of Iraq for not protecting them for years, they blame the Kurdish forces for fleeing Mount Sinjar without fighting ISIS this summer, and they blame the United States for starting the air war against ISIS and then appearing to lose interest, giving ISIS the idea that it can act against the Yazidis with impunity.\n\n\u201cWe thank President Obama because he started the operation, but we were expecting he would not stop until clearing the area of ISIS,\u201d said Ali Khalaf, a Yazidi dentist from Iraq who now lives in Germany.\n\nAmerican officials all promised the Yazidis during their visit that they would make their humanitarian crisis a priority for the U.S. government in the context of its strategy to fight ISIS and overall policy toward Iraq. But officials gave the delegation no specific commitments and made no concrete promises of increased U.S. assistance.\n\n\u201cMr. Rhodes reiterated the United States\u2019 commitment to the safety and security of the Yezidi community within a unified and pluralistic Iraq,\u201d the White House said in a statement after Rhodes met with the Yazidi delegation, using an alternate spelling for the community. \u201cHe noted the recent positive steps in the formation of an Iraqi government under the leadership of Prime Minister Abadi and stressed continued U.S. support for the development of a national program in Iraq that addresses the interests and desires of all its communities. He pledged continued humanitarian assistance for those who have been displaced inside Iraq, including the Yezidi population, and expressed our determination to provide support for Yezidi women and girls who have faced terrible abuse from ISIL.\u201d\n\nAsked if he believed the White House\u2019s statements of continued support, Khalaf said: \u201cWe have to believe the U.S. will come to help us.

And there\u2019s more where that came from.\n\nI think we can all agree that, in the current struggle for the soul of the Republican Party, few skirmishes offer better drama than the ongoing clash of the Cheney and Paul clans. Pick your permutation\u2014Dick firing on Rand , Ron firing on Dick, Rand on Liz, Dick on Ron, Rand on Dick\u2014this display of isolationist Hatfields vs. neocon McCoys consistently packs more sizzle than Anthony Weiner\u2019s Twitter feed. Plus, with Rand gearing up for a run at the big chair in 2016, the feud promises to get even hotter as the ex-veep, prodded by fellow hawks, stews over the mere possibility of a Republican POTUS so intervention-averse that he\u2019d make Barack Obama look like, well, Dick Cheney.\n\nCase in point: On March 29, during Sheldon Adelson\u2019s Las Vegas cattle call for 2016 contenders, Cheney took a slap at \u201can increasing strain of isolationism\u201d in his party. \u201cIt\u2019s not taking over, by any means, but there is without question a body of thought now that\u2019s supported by many Republicans and some candidates that the United States can afford to turn its back on that part of the world,\u201d he grumbled, referring to attitudes toward the Middle East. Cheney didn\u2019t bother mentioning Rand\u2019s name. I mean, really, why bother? Safe to say everyone in the audience knew precisely whom he meant by \u201csome candidates.\u201d\n\nBut in case anyone failed to make the connection, David Corn over at Mother Jones helpfully stirred the pot, using the ex-veep\u2019s remarks as a hook upon which to hang a four-year-old video of Paul peddling a whopping good conspiracy theory about Cheney and the Iraq War. Specifically, shortly before entering the Senate race in 2009, at an April 7 address to college Republicans at Western Kentucky University, Paul posited that Cheney had pushed for the 2003 invasion of Iraq because it would fatten Halliburton\u2019s bottom line.\n\nAs Paul apparently sees it, the timeline makes perfect sense: Back in 1995, Cheney was running around vigorously defending the first Bush administration\u2019s decision not to invade Baghdad during the first Gulf War. But then, ka-boom! (Or rather, ka-ching!) \u201cDick Cheney then goes to work for Halliburton,\u201d Paul said in 2009. \u201cMakes hundreds of millions of dollars, their CEO. Next thing you know, he\u2019s back in government and it\u2019s a good idea to go into Iraq.\u201d\n\nLest someone mistake Paul\u2019s college talk as some sort of overly enthusiastic \u201cone off,\u201d Corn points to a second Paul speech, this one at a Montana rally during his dad\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, in which Rand got even more explicit about his view of Cheney\u2019s conversion:\n\nBut, you know, a couple hundred million dollars later Dick Cheney earns from Halliburton, he comes back into government. Now Halliburton\u2019s got a billion-dollar no-bid contract in Iraq. You know, you hate to be so cynical that you think some of these corporations are able to influence policy, but I think sometimes they are.\n\nWow. Forget \u201cNo blood for oil.\u201d For Paul, America\u2019s Iraq debacle was a mercenary swap of blood for several billion dollars in federal contracts to Cheney\u2019s former company to do everything from put out oil field fires to provide housing for soldiers. That is some serious military-industrial complex paranoia.\n\nThese days, you don\u2019t hear Paul peddling theories anywhere near as incendiary. This is no accident.\n\nMake no mistake: As someone who opposed the Iraq War, I enjoy watching Cheney get slapped around on the issue as much as the next gal. But it\u2019s one thing to accuse the former veep of ideologically driven Machiavellianism; \u2019tis quite another to suggest that he did what he did out of loyalty to his Halliburton cronies. That is a far darker charge that, while already generating glee on the left, is also the kind of right-on-the-knife\u2019s-edge-of-nuttiness conspiracy-spinning likely to bite Paul on the butt as he tries to capture his party\u2019s nomination. (The senator\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThese days, you don\u2019t hear Paul peddling theories anywhere near as incendiary. This is no accident. Much has been written about the ambitious senator\u2019s move to play nicer with the Republican establishment and build a more mainstream coalition than his dad could ever manage. Gadflies may launch movements, but they rarely win the White House.\n\nAs Paul moves closer and closer to the presidential trail, however, legions of journalists, oppo researchers, and even garden-variety voters will be rooting around in his past like hogs digging for truffles. These two speeches swiping at Cheney are unlikely to be the only colorful nuggets unearthed. Paul is a passionate, quirky pol who, until very recently, didn\u2019t see much need to watch his tongue.

Expecting to fall short of the filibuster-proof 60 by one or two votes, Republican leader Mitch McConnell over the weekend played what he thinks is his ace card: Loretta Lynch.\n\nMcConnell said he wouldn\u2019t call a vote to confirm Lynch until the Senate finishes its work on the trafficking bill, in effect holding Lynch hostage to an obscure anti-abortion provision that was added by the GOP, and that went unnoticed by Democrats until pro-choice groups pointed it out.\n\nThough the stalled legislation and the Lynch confirmation haven\u2019t gotten as much attention as the standoff over funding the Department of Homeland Security, the dynamics are similar.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how the Democrats can back down,\u201d says Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. \u201cOnly one side can back down.

It\u2019s more about their inability to govern.\u201d\n\nLynch\u2014who has been confirmed twice by the Senate for her post as U.S. attorney in New York\u2014has been waiting for a vote for more than four months.\n\nThat\u2019s the longest anyone has waited in three decades for a key Cabinet position.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest in his Monday press briefing called it \u201cunconscionable.\u201d\n\nWhen McConnell assumed the leadership, he promised no government shutdowns, and that the GOP would get things done.\n\nHe barely avoided a shutdown over DHS funding, and now he\u2019s found himself yet again in a box of his own making.\n\nAnd, as usual, the argument has devolved to partisan bickering.\n\nDemocrats say Republicans violated the gentlemen\u2019s agreement between staffers from opposing parties: When the majority makes changes or additions to a bill, the minority is informed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how the Democrats can back down,\u201d says Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. \u201cOnly one side can back down. I just don\u2019t know when.\u201d\n\nInstead, Democrats say, Republicans inserted a provision in the trafficking bill that would make an anti-abortion measure known as the Hyde Amendment permanently disallow fines collected from traffickers to pay for abortions sought by their victims.\n\nOriginally passed in 1976 in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s legalization of abortion, the Hyde Amendment banned taxpayers\u2019 money from paying for abortions for women receiving Medicaid.\n\nIt\u2019s never been permanent law, yet it is customarily re-authorized every year.\n\nIn 1993, after the Clinton administration took office, rape and incest were added to life and health of the mother as exceptions.\n\nA source familiar with the language in the trafficking bill, and who supports it, concedes that the victims of trafficking likely could claim rape, and the language could be moot.\n\nYet, it is still fodder for another major standoff between the two parties. Republicans are right when they say the Hyde Amendment language is routine, but it is typically attached only to appropriations bills, and it\u2019s not permanent; it must be renewed annually.\n\nFour Democrats are expected to join 54 Republicans in Tuesday\u2019s vote to debate the trafficking bill: Bob Casey of Pennsylvania; Joe Manchin of West Virginia; Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota; and Joe Donnelly of Indiana.\n\nThe anti-abortion language slipped into the trafficking bill is \u201cappropriations gobbledygook,\u201d says Jim Manley, Democratic leader Harry Reid\u2019s former spokesman, even as he concedes Democratic staffers should have thoroughly read the 63-page bill and spotted the offending words.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until pro-choice groups saw it that the issue took on a life of its own and a bill certain to win broad bipartisan support became an albatross for McConnell.\n\n\u201cLeaving aside how it got in there, if Republicans really wanted to get this bill passed as they claim, they would just drop this language knowing it\u2019s highly objectionable to Democrats,\u201d says Manley.\n\nThat option is open to McConnell, though it would be at great political cost to his standing with the base of his party. McConnell is trying to cast Democrats as the obstructionists, and he\u2019s \u201cmade the calculation there are no political losses, that it\u2019s an inside-the-Beltway drama, starring McConnell and Reid,\u201d says Manley. \u201cMcConnell will spend a couple days talking about it, see if any Democrats are feeling the heat, and meanwhile Eric Holder is still sitting there.\u201d\n\nDemocrats lost the debate about the Hyde Amendment 40 years ago, and they\u2019ve been fighting a rear-guard action ever since.\n\nNamed after the Republican congressman who crafted it, Henry Hyde, its ban has been restricted to taxpayer funds, and extending it to cover fees collected by the government, and making it permanent, takes it to a whole new level.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like pro-choice activists can look to the Supreme Court for help or protection anymore,\u201d says Manley.\n\nSo what does this have to do with Lynch? Nothing.\n\nSo Congress is the battleground, and Lynch the collateral damage.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:46.549+0000"}

Pressed on the issue Tuesday evening, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk to you over time, but I\u2019m not going to make any statement on this.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to be very thoughtful on this,\u201d a Paul aide explained to The Daily Beast. \u201cThere are no easy solutions.\u201d\n\nIn recent days the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham (ISIS), a group disavowed by al Qaeda, has captured key cities in north and western Iraq, threatening the stability of the government in Baghdad and prompting the White House to consider military action.\n\nWhile hawkish Republicans have pushed President Obama to launch air strikes, Paul has dodged the issue. Instead, the likely 2016 presidential candidate seems more concerned that the president get congressional authorization for any future military action.\n\nSteering clear of the foreign policy specifics has allowed him to focus on executive power, a bread-and-butter issue for the libertarian-leaning senator.\n\n\u201cIf the president thinks our military is needed in Iraq, he should come back to Congress and have a full debate and vote,\u201d Doug Stafford, a senior adviser to Paul, told The Daily Beast. \u201cPresident Obama declared this war over and asked for the AUMF [Authorization for Use of Military Force] to end. Senator Paul agreed with that.\u201d\n\nChris Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute and a longtime observer of Paul\u2019s foreign policy views, said the senator has nothing to gain from supporting further American military intervention in Iraq.\n\nPaul joked that he should just tell reporters he believes \u201cwhatever McCain says.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that there is no public sentiment in favor of deeper U.S. involvement, and so there\u2019s no particular reason for Rand Paul to make that case, even if that were his inclination\u2026Politically, it wouldn\u2019t benefit him,\u201d Preble said. \u201c[Paul] appreciates that our attempts to build foreign countries like Iraq or Afghanistan\u2026have been extremely costly, and they haven\u2019t delivered clear benefits to the United States. So I think his inclination is to avoid these kinds of conflicts as much as possible.\u201d\n\nAs the president mulls the possibility of air strikes, Paul\u2019s GOP Senate colleagues have generally agreed that further congressional authorization is unnecessary.\n\n\u201cI think [Obama] has authority to do it,\u201d New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte said Tuesday. Added South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham: \u201cThe president has plenty of authority to use air power. I just wish he would use some power.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration could rely on a number of legal authorities as a basis for air strikes in Iraq, including the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that was the basis of the 2003 Iraq invasion or the AUMF directed against al Qaeda and related militant groups. But the invasion is over, Saddam Hussein is long gone, and the new threat in Iraq is ISIS.\n\nPaul has dropped hints here and there about his Iraq stance. He told the Des Moines Register this month that he didn\u2019t oppose helping arm the Iraqi military and said he \u201cwould not rule out air strikes.\u201d In a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing last week, he said he was \u201cnot very excited about\u201d the prospect of sending military service members back into Iraq.\n\nBut he stopped short of endorsing military intervention in Iraq or ruling it out, and his on-the-fence position hasn\u2019t been clarified.\n\nBoarding a senators-only elevator Tuesday morning with fellow Republican Sen. John McCain, a hawk well known for his foreign policy views, Paul joked that he should just tell reporters he believes \u201cwhatever McCain says.\u201d\n\nUnlike McCain, however, Paul\u2019s foreign policy thinking can be characterized as one of restraint.

Can the U.S. secretary of state save the day?\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Here's what U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry needs to remember when he lands in Kabul on Friday to try to fix the mess that the Afghan elections have become: The first priority is not the politicians, it\u2019s the voters.\n\nAfghans went to the polls in April and again in June, even though the Taliban threatened to kill them for doing so. In the areas where they were supposed to be in the greatest danger\u2014in the south and southeastern parts of the country where the Taliban operate widely and ruthlessly\u2014Afghans rushed to polling centers to choose their leader for a five-year term.\n\nIn the first round no candidate got the 50 percent of the votes plus one needed for a winner, as the Afghan Election Law dictates. In the June 14 runoff election, around 8 million Afghan men and women cast ballots, according to preliminary results announced this month. But amid predictable allegations of fraud, the results, it would seem, have become negotiable.\n\nAbdullah Abdullah, the former foreign minister and the front runner in the first round, whose strongest support is in the north, northeast and some central parts of the country, was fairly confident he\u2019d win the second round as well. During several media events prior to the elections he suggested that in the largely Pashtun south and southeast, people would be too afraid of Taliban reprisals to vote. He went further, saying the time has come for Pashtuns to acknowledge a non-Pashtun as their leader. Playing all the angles, he noted that he\u2019s half Pashtun himself, but in the end his strong ties to the Tajik-led faction that fought a disastrous civil war with Pashtun factions in the pre-Taliban 1990s did not endear him to the largest ethnic group in the country.\n\nAbdullah Abdullah clearly is looking to win through negotiations in a room with the Americans what he didn\u2019t win at the polls.\n\nBy contrast, Ashraf Ghani, the current forerunner in the partial second round results, got record support in Pashtun areas. Ghani, an academic and former finance minister, greatly benefited from the polarization at the polls and easily surpassed Abdullah in the second round with over a million-vote lead. The national and international observers who witnessed the elections across Afghanistan noted the obvious increase in participation. There were reports of rigging, fraud and the use of violence to influence voting. But those complaints were on both sides.\n\nOn July 9, Abdullah Abdullah rejected the preliminary results in a massive rally in Kabul and alleged President Hamid Karzai, the Election Commission and the Ghani team had conspired to rig the results and steal his victory. In effect Abdullah called into question the legitimacy of the whole electoral process. He threatened to create a \u201cparallel\u201d government. Then he called on his supporters to refrain from any violent actions and asked for a few days to decide his future course of action.\n\nThat\u2019s where Kerry comes in. Abdullah Abdullah clearly is looking to win through negotiations in a room with the Americans what he didn\u2019t win at the polls.\n\nTo be sure, the fledgling Afghan democracy is at a critical juncture, and international mediation might prove helpful in resolving the crisis, but if that means sidelining the legal electoral institutions like the Independent Election Commission (IEC) and the Election Complaint Commission (ECC) entirely, it will be a major blow to the democratic process. Afghans will lose faith in it and the credibility of modern political institutions will crumble.\n\n\n\nThe international arbitrators should give a chance to the Afghan constitutional election bodies to launch a thoroughly impartial screening of the votes before announcing any final results. In the meantime, both Ghani and Abdullah should engage in a meaningful dialogue to overcome this standoff and salvage the nation's nascent democracy.\n\nThe usual American answer in a situation like this is to press for a national unity government. (Look at Iraq right now, where that\u2019s being held up as the only way out of the crisis that has torn the country apart.) The United States and its allies will advocate representation of all political sides in the coming Afghan government to ensure its sustainability and effectiveness and avoid a resurgence of the Taliban.\n\nSo Ghani and his team should be prepared to discuss such a government as an option. But, sadly, Afghans will have to accept that in countries like theirs, casting a vote is not enough to get a government of their choice.

{"entityId": 1975, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "It\u2019s good to respect people\u2019s feelings, but universities shouldn\u2019t be forcing anyone to use sensitive language.\n\nThe University of Tennessee at Knoxville drew widespread derision last week for publishing a pronoun usage guide that asked students and professors to add the gender-neutral descriptors ze/zir/zirs and xe/xem/xyrs to their vocabularies. Conservatives accused the university of encouraging political correctness run amok, and the left accused the right of callous, lazy disregard for the feelings of transgender students.\n\nIn truth, both accusations contain at least a kernel of wisdom. But whether or not students take kindly to new pronouns, it\u2019s important to remind universities that they have no right to compel members of their campus communities to use sensitive language, even though college administrators across the country are constantly trying to do just that.\n\nThe guide, which appeared on the UT website on August 26, was authored by Donna Braquet, director of the campus\u2019s Pride Center. \u201cWe should not assume someone\u2019s gender by their appearance, nor by what is listed on a roster or in student information systems,\u201d warned Braquet. \u201cTransgender people and people who do not identity within the gender binary may use a different name than their legal name and pronouns of their gender identity, rather than the pronouns of the sex they were assigned at birth.\u201d\n\nBraquet went on to instruct professors to ask students how they wish to be identified on the first day of class. Her post included a graphic that listed gender-neutral pronouns ze/zir/zirs and xe/xem/xyrs alongside the traditional pronouns he/him/his and she/her/hers.\n\nThe First Amendment protects the rights of students at public universities to use whichever pronouns they wish, and it also protects the rights of professors to run their classrooms in any manner they choose.\n\n\u201cIn fact, there are dozens of gender-neutral pronouns,\u201d wrote Braquet. \u201cA few of the most common singular gender-neutral pronouns are they, them, their (used as singular), ze, hir, hirs, and xe, xem, xyr. These may sound a little funny at first, but only because they are new. The she and he pronouns would sound strange too if we had been taught ze when growing up.\u201d\n\nWhat sounded strange to many students was the idea that they would be forced to describe each other using words they had never heard of.\n\n\u201cHow does this make the campus so much more inclusive?\u201d wondered student Michael Hensley, chairman of the campus\u2019s chapter of Young Americans for Freedom, in a statement to The College Fix. \u201cIt\u2019s a certain set of those in academia that have created these words out of nothing.\u201d\n\nThe university countered that adherence to the guide wasn\u2019t mandatory\u2014students and professors would incur no penalty for failing to use gender-neutral pronouns. But this explanation didn\u2019t come quickly enough, and many news sites ran articles contending that the university had formally replaced the words he and she with alien-looking expressions. At least one local Republican politician promised to convene a legislative hearing to look into the matter. In response, University of Tennessee system president Joe DiPietro ordered administrators to take down the web page on pronouns.\n\n\u201cDespite the aggressive efforts by UT Knoxville to communicate the fact that the campus does not require the use of gender-neutral pronouns, I am deeply concerned about the attention this matter continues to receive and the harm it has had on the reputation of the University of Tennessee,\u201d DiPietro said in a statement. \u201cThe social issues and practices raised by the Office for Diversity and Inclusion are appropriate ones for discussion on a university campus. However, it was not appropriate to do so in a manner that suggests it is the expectation that all on campus embrace these practices.\u201d\n\nSupporters of transgender people remained mystified that a harmless suggestion to use inclusive language could be received so poorly. \u201cSociety changes, language changes and today on college campuses, there are increasing numbers of people who specify nontraditional pronouns,\u201d said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, in an interview with Inside Higher Ed. \u201cWhy not respect them?\u201d\n\nIndeed, why not respect them? Certainly, one ought to honor the easily fulfilled wishes of transgender students\u2014or anyone who prefers to go by a nickname, middle name, or some other unobvious term. Professors who ask members of class how they wish to be identified are doing the kind thing, and students who exercise some courtesy when addressing their classmates deserve a pat on the back.\n\nBut what one ought to say and what one is required to say are very, very different things. The First Amendment protects the rights of students at public universities to use whichever pronouns they wish, and it also protects the rights of professors to run their classrooms in any manner they choose. College administrators can\u2019t bully members of campus into adopting different behavior, even if said behavior is generally advisable.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that UT wasn\u2019t actually forcing students to censor their he\u2019s and she\u2019s, the message was sufficiently confusing to make it unclear whether the pronoun guide was a suggestion or a decree. And it\u2019s really no surprise that so many people interpreted Braquet\u2019s advice as an articulation of mandatory campus-wide policy. Universities continuously blur this line when they attempt to spell out their contradictory rules on offensive speech.\n\nThe City University of New York, in fact, told faculty members last January that they should stop using gender-specific salutations like \u201cMr.\u201d and \u201cMs.\u201d in emails to each other and to students. CUNY\u2019s speech requirement was mandatory; administrators maintained that the elimination of gendered language was necessary in order to bring the university in compliance with Title IX, a federal law that requires equality in higher education.\n\nThe idea that Title IX requires such a degree of language policing is preposterous, and would never stand up in court. But university administrators seem very confused about their obligation under the Bill of Rights to take the side of free speech whenever and wherever conflicts with bizarre federal dictates arise.\n\nAll people deserve respect, and the classroom is the ideal place to educate students about new and improved ways to use language to foster human dignity. But that educational duty falls to professors, not university bureaucrats. There\u2019s simply no place for mandatory pronoun policing at institutions that value free speech.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:47.833+0000"}

But, of course, stuff like that doesn\u2019t really make news here in our country.\n\nOr did you hear about the Christian militant who publicly beheaded a Muslim man in the streets of the CAR capital last year?

Anyone doubt that if a Muslim terrorist beheaded a Christian man in the public square it would\u2019ve made the U.S. news?\n\nAny cable news channels cover in depth the Christian marauders in CAR that are\u2013as we speak\u2013ethnically cleansing tens of thousnads of the minority Muslim population there?

Rush Limbaugh called Obama\u2019s words an \u201cinsult\u201d to Christianity.\n\n\n\nAnd numerous Fox News anchors were outraged, most notably Eric Bolling, who claimed that the number of people killed in the name of Christianity was \u201czero.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo be honest, I do agree with the right-wing pundits on one issue. I do wish Obama didn\u2019t bring up the Crusades to point out the violence committed in the name of Christianity. The last Crusade took place over 700 years ago.\n\nSince 1977 there have been \u201c8 murders, 17 attempted murders, 42 bombings, 181 arsons, and thousands of incidences of other criminal activities\u201d targeting reproductive health care facilities here at home.\n\nThe attacks by the Christian militants taking place in CAR is a far better example of how all faiths have people who wage violence in the name of it. Obama could have also noted the horrifically violent actions of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, a pseudo-Christian cult whose announced goal is to impose the Ten Commandants as the law of Uganda. To that end, the LRA slaughtered thousands of men, women and children, raped women, and forced people into being sex slaves over a 25-year period starting in 1986.\n\nOr Obama could have simply focused on the violence perpetrated by Christian terrorists in America. For starters, since 1977 there have been \u201ceight murders, 17 attempted murders, 42 bombings, 181 arsons, and thousands of incidences of other criminal activities\u201d targeting reproductive health care facilities here at home. With few exceptions, there were perpetrated by Christians who opposed abortion for religious reasons.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that Eric Rudolph, who was tied to the white supremacist \u201cChristian Identity\u201d movement, had bombed abortion clinics, a gay nightclub and the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, which killed two people and wounded 110. Rudolph\u2019s stated motivation was to stop abortion, claiming our government had \u201clegalized, sanctioned and legitimized\u201d abortion, and thus, \u201cthey forfeited their legitimacy and moral authority to govern.\u201d\n\nAnd there was also the 2009 execution of Dr. George Tiller, who became nationally known for performing late-term abortions. His killer, Scott Roeder, was a born-again Christian who claimed that he the killing \u201cwas justified to save the lives of unborn children.\u201d\n\nLook, I fully understand that some don\u2019t want to believe people of their faith have commited atrocities. I\u2019m Muslim\u2014and I can assure you that when I hear about acts of violence carried out by any Muslim, I\u2019m outraged. Still, I can\u2019t deny that there are Muslims who commit terrorism.\n\nHowever, with both ISIS and these Christian terrorists, I know that their actions are not based on the tenets of their respective faiths but on their own political agenda. And that is why I won\u2019t call the Christian terrorists followers of \u201cradical Christianity.\u201d There is no such thing, just as there is no such thing as \u201cradical Islam.\u201d But there are radical and violent followers of both religions who commit acts in the name of their respective faith.\n\nClearly President Obama and I have no intention of demonizing Christians. We\u2019re just trying to put religious violence in context. In fact, like Obama, my mother is a Christian and my father Muslim and I was raised to have great respect for both religions.\n\nBut we can\u2019t deny reality.

Hodges that same-sex marriage rights were universal, the popular verdict was in: gay marriage\u2014and gay life\u2014had become as American as apple pie.\n\nTwo years ago, in June 2013 the Supreme Court refused to limit the words \u201cmarriage\u201d and \u201cspouse\u201d to heterosexual unions, invalidating the Defense of Marriage Act. That November, the Senate passed ENDA, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act banning anti-gay discrimination in the workplace 64 to 32\u2014including 10 Republican votes, although the House of Representative has yet to pass it. Until recently, Democrats often opposed gay marriage publicly, even while approving it privately; now, Republicans are increasingly supporting gay marriage publicly\u2014or dodging the issue Chris Christie style\u2014even while disapproving it privately. This reversal in what constitutes the politically safe position on gays probably represents America\u2019s fastest, sharpest U-turn on a fundamental social issue since the 1960s.\n\nTwenty-two years ago, when the last Democratic president, Bill Clinton, admitted he approved of gays serving in the military, the resulting firestorm ultimately imposed \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, only 69 House members signed a letter supporting gay rights. Three years later in 1996, Clinton wooed the center by signing the Defense of Marriage Act, whose key provision many Clinton nominees to the Supreme Court eventually gutted in U.S. v. Windsor (2013) as placing an unfair \u201cstigma\u201d on gay spouses. As of January 2004 gay marriage was illegal in all 50 states.\n\nEven as recently as seven years ago, when Barack Obama\u2019s presidency began, gays were weaker politically. Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign triggered a surge of socially conservative black and Hispanic voters who helped pass California\u2019s Proposition 8 banning same sex marriage. With many blacks\u2014and Democrats\u2014still opposing civil unions, Obama had not endorsed gay marriage. As president, he only approved same sex marriage on May 9, 2012, thanks to Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s blurting out his own endorsement days earlier on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nWhat John Adams would have labeled a revolution \u201cin the minds and hearts of the people,\u201d has been rapid and radical. Since Thomas Jefferson\u2019s wonderfully subversive phrase in the Declaration of Independence proclaiming \u201call men are created equal,\u201d gradually, \u201call\u201d broadened to include blacks, gays and others. \u201cMen\u201d expanded to include women; even the notion of \u201cequal\u201d grew.\n\nThose seeking to create a heroic history of gay liberation emphasize the Stonewall protests of 1969, along with four decades\u2019 worth of protests producing legislative and legal victories. But in fact, a mass cultural conversion precipitated this political change.\n\nGays changed their collective image by embracing marriage during an epidemic of heterosexual divorce.\n\nWhile rooted in the Sixties\u2019 sexual revolution and the Seventies\u2019 \u201cMe Decade,\u201d this cultural revolution went national in the 1980s. Ironically, the AIDS tragedy helped mainstream gay life. Many gays became more open about their lifestyles, while many heterosexuals became more aware of gays around them, especially after the disease killed President Ronald Reagan\u2019s friend, the Hollywood legend Rock Hudson, in 1985.\n\nIn the 1990s, despite the complex politics handcuffing Clinton, Hollywood propagandized effectively for gay equality. Movie blockbusters like Philadelphia starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, and The Birdcage, starring Robin Williams and Gene Hackman, cast in celluloid the dominant Hollywood stereotype of gays as normal, respectable, family-loving Americans underneath whatever flamboyant facades some might choose\u2014with conservative opponents cast as Neanderthals awaiting redemption. A year later, the comedienne Ellen DeGeneres came out of the closet on The Oprah Winfrey Show. With art first imitating, then shaping, life, DeGeneres\u2019s popular sitcom character \u201cEllen\u201d subsequently came out to her therapist, played by Oprah Winfrey.\n\nWill and Grace debuted in 1998 introducing Will Truman, an openly-gay lawyer sporting an all-American name and a conservative personality. By 2005, the American public proved surprisingly open to a sexually explicit macho males\u2019 love story in Brokeback Mountain. Movies and television had not only normalized what most once deemed abnormal, they glamorized what most once deemed repulsive.\n\nAs with the Reagan years, the George W. Bush years proved surprisingly good for gays in their march to social and political acceptance. Mary Cheney\u2019s lesbianism was not that scandalous, and actually softened the George W. Bush-Dick Cheney image. When Bush\u2019s former Republican National Committee chair, Ken Mehlman, came out in 2010, many emphasized the shocking fact that few were shocked.\n\nCheney\u2019s and Mehlman\u2019s outsider-as-insider stories, paralleling millions of others\u2019 paths, reveal gays\u2019 power as both an invisible minority and as the privileged oppressed. Like Jews, gays frequently pass easily in society, often asserting their distinct identity as they please. It becomes hard to hate \u201cthem\u201d when \u201cthey\u201d are \u201cus.\u201d\n\nAnd, like women, many gays sit at the most elite familial, corporate and governmental tables in the land, giving them the exclusive access long denied to African-Americans and other minorities. This growing intimacy, familiarity, and prominence, with millions coming out to relatives and colleagues, set the stage for this decade\u2019s political and legal changes. Before Friday, 37 states and Washington, D.C., allowed same-sex marriages.\n\nIronically\u2014but cleverly\u2014gays changed their collective image by embracing marriage during an epidemic of heterosexual divorce. Emphasizing their conventionality and familiarity, rather than flamboyance and rebelliousness, gays have framed equal treatment as a civil rights issue, appealing to an increasingly fluid and tolerant society that worships individual rights and abhors discrimination.\n\nThe late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan taught that: \u201cThe central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics that determines the success of a society. The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself.\u201d This time, cultural transformation triggered liberal change. Especially in today\u2019s horizontal democracy, culture matters, ideas count, media transforms\u2014and sometimes, politics and the law just catch up.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:48.825+0000"}

Many would say the question tripping up 2016 hopefuls Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio is worth asking\u2014but not the neoconservatives who pushed for the war.\n\nThe Iraq hypotheticals currently ensnaring the Republican Party\u2019s presidential candidates are \u201casinine\u201d and the worst of \u201cgotcha journalism,\u201d argue some of the neoconservative thinkers who advocated most aggressively for the 2003 invasion.\n\nQuestioning whether the United States should have gone to war in Iraq is pointless, they say, because decision-makers never get to make future decisions with the benefit of hindsight.\n\n\u201cNobody lives life backwards,\u201d said Eliot Cohen, a founding member of the Project for a New American Century and later a top aide to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. \u201cAt the time, reasonable people could disagree over whether to go to war in Iraq. It\u2019s really a silly hypothetical, and the people who ask it should know better. You don\u2019t get to relive history that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt reflects more on the media\u2019s obsession with a new litmus test,\u201d said Danielle Pletka, the vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cOne isn\u2019t president or commander in chief in hindsight.\u201d\n\nThe United States continues to suffer the consequences of the Iraq war: thousands of American lives lost at a cost of billions of dollars. Assessments after the initial invasion found that the massive weapons of mass destruction program the Bush administration used as one of the primary reasons to go to war simply didn\u2019t exist.\n\nAnd in the instability that followed the U.S. withdrawal from the country, another deadly terrorist group emerged: the so-called Islamic State, which has beheaded Americans and threatens U.S. allies in the region.\n\nSo the price of invasion has certainly been very steep, and worth assessing.\n\nThe press has savaged Republican presidential candidates Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio over the past week for saying both that the invasion of Iraq was the right decision and that they would not have invaded Iraq with the benefit of current knowledge\u2014that intelligence assessments of Iraq\u2019s WMD program were wildly incorrect.\n\nIn the years after the invasion of Iraq, neoconservatives have expressed few regrets about their efforts to encourage the toppling of Saddam Hussein via invasion.\n\nBill Kristol, the founder and editor of the hawkish Weekly Standard, said that even knowing what we know now, he would have still pushed for an invasion.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an asinine question that says more about the politicization of debate than it does about the candidates themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen would have surged troops much earlier,\u201d he said, \u201cand would not have thrown it all away after the war was effectively won at the end of 2008.\u201d\n\nBut Kristol doesn\u2019t hold it against Republicans like Bush and Rubio for thinking differently: \u201cCan\u2019t blame candidates for not wanting to spend time and effort taking on the politically correct No position,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd those who disagree with The Weekly Standard\u2019s editor, one of the most ardent advocates of the invasion, shouldn\u2019t expect an apology. In an email to The Daily Beast, Kristol signed off:\n\n\u201cUnapologetically,\n\nBill\u201d\n\nThe Iraq question, first asked by Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly of Jeb Bush, should not have been unexpected. Nor was it inconsequential: The heart of the question is whether, absent the threat of a major Iraqi WMD program, the invasion of Iraq was still wise.\n\nBut both Cohen and Pletka said the structure of the question pointed to something deeper about American press coverage of American politicians\u2014the desire to catch a politician off guard in a moment of uncertainty rather than trying to achieve a deeper understanding of where candidates stand on various issues and how they would react in a crisis.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an asinine question that says more about the politicization of debate than it does about the candidates themselves,\u201d Pletka said.\n\nCohen, who wrote his first book in 1978 and joined the policy planning staff of the office of the secretary of defense in 1990, called the \u201cgotcha journalism\u201d view of foreign policy poisonous and counterproductive\u2014and said it is more prevalent now than in previous years.\n\n\u201cIn past eras in the United States, people would have serious conversations about foreign policy\u2026which is going to be necessary, because the world is now such a complicated place,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cPeople are going to [need] the patience to examine each of the candidates on both sides and get a sense of where they stand.\u201d\n\nThe press, he said, should focus on building up a \u201ccomposite portrait\u201d of presidential candidates and their foreign policy views on China and on Iran.\n\nAdded Pletka, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather hear what they would do now about Iraq? Now that\u2019s a harder question.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone in their right mind hasn\u2019t been happy if you look at Iraq\u2014you certainly have to ask yourself [about] the return that we got for the investment in blood and treasure...People should ask themselves what are the lessons to be learned from the whole Iraqi experience,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nWhile he dismissed the current GOP debate as a \u201csilly hypothetical,\u201d Cohen did say revisiting the Iraq War is necessary. He identified three areas presidential candidates should be questioned about on Iraq: What the war taught us about America\u2019s ability to acquire intelligence on weapons of mass destruction programs; the ability of the U.S. government to adapt to challenges such as counterinsurgency and building up a foreign military, and how to disengage properly after an invasion.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:49.102+0000"}
{"entityId": 1979, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "There will be six Democratic debates announced this week\u2014and if candidates stray from the DNC\u2019s strict rules, they will be punished by the Party Elite.\n\nOnce the Republican presidential candidates leave the debate stage, the spotlight will shift to the Democrats. The Daily Beast has learned that the Democratic National Committee will announce its debate schedule later this week, with six debates beginning in the fall, and with penalties for candidates and media outlets that stray from the sanctioned schedule.\n\nDemocrats are way behind the pace they set in the 2008 cycle\u2014the last time there was an open Democratic nomination. By this point in the primary calendar, there had already been five debates, the first one in South Carolina in April \u201907. Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist and debate expert, said in an e-mail that the process got off to a later start this year because Democrats didn\u2019t have a declared candidate until May, when Hillary Clinton announced. In 2007, meanwhile, the field was pretty well set by May, she recalled.\n\n\u201cIf we had tried to hold debates in April 2015 we would have had no candidates. The Republicans are starting in August, we will start in the fall, and I think both parties felt this was the right balance,\u201d Dunn wrote.\n\nDebate planning has been underway at the DNC since early last year, and Vice President Biden\u2019s staff has been kept in the loop all along as a party leader and someone who has openly talked about possibly running. Lobbying by the campaigns has been intense, with Clinton\u2019s campaign wanting fewer than six debates, while the staffs of Martin O\u2019Malley and Bernie Sanders asking for more than that.\n\nThe sooner the debates begin, the sooner candidates like Sanders and O\u2019Malley are helped. They need the oxygen, the airtime, the access to donors -- all the benefits that flow from standing on the stage with the frontrunner. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Clinton will be helped as well, says Washington lawyer and Democratic activist Paul Equale.\n\nOne thing is sure, Clinton is going to follow the rules; she won\u2019t do more than the six debates.\n\n\u201cThe sooner the phony war becomes a real campaign, the better for Hillary,\u201d he says. \u201cShe has the worst of all worlds now with this pseudo campaign going on. Once she stands on the stage with people who are running against her, she can be spontaneous and authentic and present herself as a real candidate, as opposed to a heir apparent waiting to be coronated.\u201d\n\nFormer DNC chairman Howard Dean first introduced the idea of limiting debates to six when he chaired the DNC at the beginning of the \u201908 cycle. There had been 24 Democratic debates during the \u201904 cycle and candidates could do little else but go from debate prep to debate to debate prep, with little time for campaigning. With so many debates, there were diminishing returns for the candidates, the voters and for media outlets whose budgets were strained.\n\nDean\u2019s proposal fell apart almost immediately. Univision invited Democrats to debate, and no one was going to say no to that. Then the invitations kept coming, from labor, from environmentalists, and by the end of the \u201908 primaries, there had been 27 debates.\n\nSo this cycle, determined to put a lid on the process, Democrats took an idea from the Republicans, who had announced there would be penalties on their candidates if they went outside the Republican National Committee\u2019s sanctioned debates. If Sanders or O\u2019Malley tries to test the DNC, they would risk getting aced out of the other debates. Ditto for a media outlet that tried to mount something separate on the side, as they would risk losing Hillary Clinton as a contender.\n\nOne thing is sure, Clinton is going to follow the rules; she won\u2019t do more than the six debates. And the networks understand the DNC has control of the process because Hillary is on board with the plan and she\u2019s not going to show up for any debates that are not sanctioned.\n\nForums are allowed because they\u2019re more of a cattle call. All five Democratic candidates will be speaking at the DNC summer meeting in Minneapolis on August 28th, but they won\u2019t be sharing a stage.\n\nThe DNC will also announce this week uniform criteria for inclusion in the debates. Democrats aren\u2019t concerned about the number of candidates as they don\u2019t have that many. But they want to head off what happened in \u201907 and \u201908, when debate hosts changed the rules from debate to debate.\n\nThe result was former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel, the first in the field to announce for president, being allowed into several debates. He quickly achieved notoriety for his anti-war position and curmudgeonly demeanor. Then, after failing to exceed 1 percent in the polls, he was barred from debating.\n\nAnti-war candidate Dennis Kucinich suffered much the same fate. The criteria for when he was in or out of a particular debate was subject to change, and after MSNBC excluded him from a January \u201908 debate in Las Vegas, Kucinich sued the network. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled against him, and Kucinich was out of the race by late January, citing his exclusion from the debates as a factor in his decision.\n\nThis time the DNC isn\u2019t leaving anything to chance as the party lays out its debate agenda. In politics, however, the best-laid plans often go awry, and this level of control by the party establishment is almost certain to get pushback from some Democrats.

Grassroots organizing accompanied an agenda of legislative sabotage led by the Republican congressional hierarchy. Media demagogues stoked the flames of resentment. President Obama was mockingly called \u201cThe One\u201d and excoriated as an Arab, an imam, even the Antichrist. Posters identified him with Hitler, placed his head on the body of a chimpanzee, implied that he was a crack addict, portrayed him with a bone through his nose, and showed the White House lawn lined with rows of watermelons. Six years later, the fury has hardly subsided: Thousands of young people check on racist websites like Stormfront every month, anti-Semitism is again becoming fashionable, Islamophobia is rampant, and conservative politicians are suing President Obama in the courts for his supposed abuse of power while their more radical supporters are labeling him a traitor.\n\nMost of these people don\u2019t see themselves as bigots. They long to reinstate the \u201creal\u201d America perhaps best depicted in old television shows like Father Knows Best and Leave It to Beaver. This completely imaginary America was orderly and prosperous. Women were happily in the kitchen; gays were in the closet; and blacks knew their place. But this world (inexplicably!) came under attack from just these (ungrateful!) groups thereby creating resentment especially among white males on the political right. They feel persecuted and wish to roll back time. Their counterattack is based on advocating policies that would hinder same-sex marriage, champion the insertion of \u201cChristian\u201d values into public life, deny funds for women\u2019s health and abortion clinics, cut government policies targeting the inner cities, protect a new prison network inhabited largely by people of color, eliminate limits on campaign spending, and increase voting restrictions that would effectively disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged citizens.\n\nNeanderthals still exist along with blatant examples of old-style prejudice and hatred. But the bigot is adapting to a new world. The bigot now employs camouflage in translating his prejudices into reality. To forestall criticism, he now makes use of supposedly \u201ccolor-blind\u201d economic and anti-crime policies, liberal notions of tolerance, individualism, the entrepreneurial spirit, local government, historical traditions, patriotism, and fears of nonexistent voter fraud to maintain the integrity of the electoral process. The bigot today is often unaware either that he has prejudices or that he is indulging them.\n\nUnfortunately, popular understandings of the bigot remain anchored in an earlier time. His critics tend to highlight the personal rather than the political, crude language and sensational acts rather than mundane legislation and complicated policy decisions. Many are unwilling to admit that bigotry has entered the mainstream. It is more comforting to associate bigotry with certain attitudes supposedly on the fringes of public life. Words wound but policies wound even more. Everyday citizens grow incensed when some commentator lets slip a racist or politically incorrect phrase. But they are far more tolerant when faced with policies that blatantly disadvantage or attack the bigot\u2019s traditional targets whose inferiority is still identified with fixed and immutable traits: gays, immigrants, people of color, and women.\n\nReactionary movements and conservative parties have provided a congenial home for true believers, provincial chauvinists, and elitists of an aristocratic or populist bent. Not exclusively: Liberals and socialists\u2014though usually with a guilty conscience\u2014have also occasionally endorsed imperialism, nationalism, racism, and the politics of bigotry. But while the connection between right-wing politics and bigotry does not hold true in every instance, it is true most of the time. It is certainly true today. Ideologues of the Tea Party provide legitimacy and refuge for advocates of intolerance while the GOP provides legitimacy and refuge for the Tea Party.\n\nThe bigot today is often unaware either that he has prejudices or that he is indulging them.\n\nNot every bigot is a conservative and not every conservative is a bigot. Yet they converge in supporting an agenda that aims to constrict intellectual debate, social pluralism, economic equality, and democratic participation. Either the bigot or the conservative can insist that his efforts to shrink the welfare state are motivated solely by a concern with maximizing individual responsibility; either can claim that his opposition to gay rights is simply a defense of traditional values; and either can argue that increasing the barriers to voting is required to guarantee fair elections. Whatever they subjectively believe, however, their agenda objectively disadvantages gays, immigrants, women, and people of color.\n\nReasonable people can disagree about this or that policy as it applies to any of these groups. Any policy, progressive or not, can be criticized in good faith. But ethical suspicions arise when an entire agenda is directed against the ensemble of what President Reagan derisively termed \u201cspecial interests.\u201d No conservative political organization today has majority support from women, the gay community, or people of color. There must be a reason. It cannot simply be that the conservative \u201cmessage\u201d has not been heard; that members of these groups are overwhelmingly parasitical and awaiting their overly generous government \u201chandouts;\u201d or that so-called special interests are incapable of appreciating what is in their interest. A more plausible explanation, I think, is that those who are still targets of prejudice and discrimination have little reason to trust conservatism\u2019s political advocates.\n\nIs the conservative a bigot? It depends. Is the particular conservative intent upon defending traditions simply because they exist, supporting community values even if they are discriminatory; and treating political participation as a privilege rather than a right? Critics of the bigot should begin placing a bit less emphasis on what he says or feels than what he actually does. That conservative can always rationalize his actions\u2014platitudes come cheap. But then perhaps, one day, he will find himself looking in the mirror and (who knows?) the bigot might just be staring back.\n\nStephen Eric Bronner is a Distinguished Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University.

In addition, a Democrat-leaning PPP poll had Clinton at 67 percent with Biden and Warren tied at 7 percent.\n\nApparently Democrats do want a coronation but is it because they do not have better choices?\n\nCertainly, no serious Democrat in his or her right mind is going to willingly throw their body against a ferocious Hillary Machine currently under construction. That would be akin to committing political suicide unless the politician had ulterior motives such as aiming to raise his own national media profile by appearing on a debate stage next to the royal HRC. Even Biden seems hesitant to go full throttle against Hillary.\n\nAs a Republican hoping that my party will recapture the White House in 2016, I am envious of this potential coronation\u2014for such candidate unity years out from a presidential election is both rare and highly unusual in either party.\n\nTherefore, how could any Republican not be jealous of Hillary\u2019s three-year head start building a billion-dollar national campaign organization with 70 percent Democratic voter support?\n\nAnd what do Republicans have?\n\nWell, Senator Rand Paul last weekend won the straw poll at CPAC, so I guess that means he is now the 2016 front-runner. But that victory is analogous to the GOP renting a straw hut compared to owning a steel skyscraper.\n\nIs there any candidate who appeared at CPAC or who did not appear that is capable of building an organization that will match Hillary\u2019s after the Republican bench gets whittled down to one tired nominee in the spring of 2016?\n\nMore unfortunate is building that national organization will only begin after the bench-sitters have wiped the blood and mud off of each other and the video of their sparring matches is already appearing in Hillary\u2019s television ads.\n\nDo you remember how back in April of 2012 President Obama\u2019s reelection campaign started launching non-stop attacks on Mitt Romney? The ads negatively defined him just as he had sewed up the Republican nomination.\n\nSome Republican strategists believe the timing and effectiveness of those ads did irreparable harm to Romney\u2019s branding and contributed to his ultimate defeat.\n\nIn 2016 around springtime or even earlier, you can expect Hillary to give the GOP nominee that same kind of treatment. Hillary 2016\u2019s organization will be like running against a presidential incumbent with all the resources in place.\n\nMeanwhile, recent RealClearPolitics poll averages show Hillary defeating the GOP\u2019s prospective candidates by margins of as little as 9 points for Paul Ryan to a high of 17 points for Marco Rubio . Former frontrunner\u201d Chris Christie loses to Hillary by 12 points, and new frontrunner Paul goes down by 12 points as well.\n\nThe saving grace in all this depressing news, from my Republican point of view, is that in political dog years we are decades away from 2016 and anything can happen.\n\nCertainly there is the real possibility that Republicans could win control of both houses of Congress in 2014 and even keep control beyond 2016. Then Hillary, if were elected, she would face divided government.\n\nBut now let\u2019s go back to the title question, \u201cYou say you want a coronation?\u201d\n\nYou will be hearing this question asked more often as time moves along because the media likes horse races from both parties and a coronation is boring.\n\nSo whether Republicans are ready or not, Hillary is getting ready and that is something the GOP must address organizationally now, because waiting until 2016 will be too late.\n\nI would suggest that the Republican National Committee start setting up \u201cWe are ready, too\u201d offices around the nation to even the playing field.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:50.397+0000"}

{"entityId": 1983, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Birth-control pioneer Margaret Sanger embraced some truly horrific ideas. But she also did quite a lot of good.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz has become the first GOP presidential candidate to formally sign on to the efforts by a group of black pastors to get a bust of Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger removed from an exhibit at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery. The participants, who held a press conference Thursday, claim that Sanger\u2019s appearance in the exhibit, called, \u201cStruggle for Justice,\u201d is offensive, because it places the reproductive rights trailblazer in a position of honor alongside such icons as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks.\n\nThanks to the recent release of a series of controversial videos, Sanger\u2019s link to Planned Parenthood would have likely been enough to elicit criticism of her inclusion in the exhibit. But Sanger also espoused some views about race and class that were, at times, deplorable.\n\nSo are Cruz and his fellow conservatives correct? Should black Americans find Sanger\u2019s legacy, and the celebration of her legacy by the National Portrait Gallery and Planned Parenthood, offensive?\n\nThere is no question that Margaret Sanger, born in 1879, held some views that any reasonable person today would consider unconscionable. She viewed eugenics as sound policy and considered the Ku Klux Klan an appropriate ideological partner to advance her work as a family planning advocate. For these reasons, she\u2019s not someone I would call a great person, particularly speaking as an African-American woman who is not from a wealthy background, meaning Sanger likely would have deemed me \u201cunfit\u201d to reproduce.\n\nBut that does not change the fact that all reasonable people should also be able to agree that America would be far worse off had Margaret Sanger never existed. The fact is before Sanger\u2019s arrest in 1916 and subsequent jail sentence for aiding women in acquiring birth control, which resulted in a landmark legal ruling, most American woman did not have access to reliable forms of family planning.\n\nBesides the many health advantages American families experienced due to greater access to contraception thanks to the Sanger case, there have also been countless cultural benefits to society.\n\nThis means that most American women lacked the ability to plan the number of children they would have. As a result, families were larger, poorer, and women were more likely to die earlier. Infant mortality rates were also high. This shouldn\u2019t be particularly surprising. A woman lacking access to quality health care and nutrition is less likely to give birth to a healthy baby, or to be able to provide access to necessary nutrition or health care to a baby that was originally born healthy.\n\nBesides the many health advantages American families experienced due to greater access to contraception thanks to the Sanger case, there have also been countless cultural benefits to society. As families have shrunk women\u2019s participation in society has increased, as has the emergence of more women in positions of power. There are more women in colleges, corporate boardrooms and Congress. This shouldn\u2019t come as a shock. After all, if a woman has eight children, the norm for 1800s America, she might have second thoughts about committing to the grueling schedule required to be a political candidate, particularly one who has to commute between Washington, D.C., and another state on a regular basis.\n\nSo with the exception of GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum, who is opposed to birth control and has a large family, it is highly likely that Republican candidates, including Senator Ted Cruz, owe a debt of gratitude to Margaret Sanger, whether they want to admit it or not. (Cruz, it should be noted, has two children, and his wife, Heidi, is a high-powered investment banker.)\n\nFor Cruz and other Sanger critics, her sins outweigh her contributions. But my question is: Who gets to decide that? While Sanger\u2019s inclusion in the \u201cStruggle for Justice\u201d exhibit has drawn protests, Henry Clay\u2019s inclusion in the \u201cA Conversation About America\u201d exhibit at the same institution has not.\n\nClay, like many of the men that shaped our nation, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, owned slaves. Which means if we removed the statues and portraits of every leader who contributed to this country in a meaningful way for gross moral failings, then the walls of the White House, the Capitol and most State Houses would be empty.\n\nAs a black American, I can say that while I am troubled by some of Margaret Sanger\u2019s words, I would be remiss not to acknowledge her contributions to my community. Though some conservative critics seem to hold Sanger accountable for the high abortion rates within the black community since she founded the precursor to Planned Parenthood, Sanger\u2019s own attitudes about abortion were complex, and not what we might call \u201cpro-choice\u201d today.\n\nIn 1918 she wrote, \u201cWhile there are cases where even the law recognizes an abortion as justifiable if recommended by a physician, I assert that the hundreds of thousands of abortions performed in America each year are a disgrace to civilization.\u201d Instead, she argued that government\u2019s failure to not make contraception widely accessible to all women made the government culpable in any deaths resulting from abortion.\n\nSanger also railed against what she saw as the class inequality and hypocrisy evident in the multitude of family-planning options available to well-to-do white women versus what was available to the poor, many of them immigrants or black. Both of my grandmothers, born in the 1910s, were from large families. One of them was one of 14 children, the other was one of eight. They struggled in poverty as children, something they both talked about. When they decided to have families of their own, they were able to plan a size that worked for them, an option that had not been available to their mothers.\n\nAs a result, my parents became the first in their families to graduate from college, and I grew up a member of America\u2019s middle class. This would not have been possible without Margaret Sanger\u2019s contributions, which benefited millions of Americans from all walks of life. So if she doesn\u2019t belong in American exhibit titled \u201cStruggle for Justice,\u201d then who does?", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:51.112+0000"}

But as the U.S. and EU prepare to unveil new sanctions against Russia, Putin has decided the interactions should stop. The Kremlin has ended high-level contact with the Obama administration, according to diplomatic officials and sources close to the Russian leadership. The move signals an end to the diplomacy, for now.\n\n\u201cPutin will not talk to Obama under pressure,\u201d said Igor Yurgens, Chairman of the Institute for Contemporary Development, a prominent Moscow think tank, and a close associate of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. \u201cIt does not mean forever.\u201d\n\nObama and Putin last spoke over the phone on April 14, a call that the White House said was initiated at Moscow\u2019s request. Obama urged Putin in the call to end Kremlin support for armed, pro-Russian activists creating unrest in eastern Ukraine. Obama also warned that the U.S. would impose more \u201ccosts\u201d on Russia if Putin continued his current course. According to the Kremlin\u2019s readout of the call, Putin denied Russian interference in eastern Ukraine and said \u201cthat such speculations are based on inaccurate information.\u201d\n\nObama and Putin have spoken to each other about Ukraine regularly over the past weeks, including calls on March 28, March 16, and March 6. But that these calls are now on hold for the indefinite future, due to their lack of progress and frustration on both sides.\n\nOn Friday, Kerry warned that new round of American financial assaults on Russia were on the way. \u201cWe are putting in more sanctions, they will probably come Monday at the latest,\u201d he said in a private meeting in Washington, according to an attendee. Russian businesses and individuals close to Putin would be on the sanctions list, he added.\n\nDiplomatic sources close to the process confirmed that Putin is not interested in speaking with Obama again in the current environment. The two leaders might talk again in the future but neither side is reaching out for direct interaction, as they had been doing since the Ukraine crisis began. The failure of the agreement struck last week in Geneva between the contact group of the U.S., EU, Russia, and Ukraine has made further direct Washington-Moscow interactions moot.\n\n\u201c\u2018We are putting in more sanctions, they will probably come Monday at the latest,\u2019 Kerry said. Russian businesses and individuals close to Putin would be on the sanctions list, he added.\u201d\n\nOther top U.S. officials are also now out of direct contact with their Russian interlocutors. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is also getting the cold shoulder from his Russian counterpart Sergey Shoygu. Pentagon officials have reached out to Russia on Mr. Hagel\u2019s behalf within the past 24 hours but have not gotten any response, according to Pentagon Spokesman Army Col. Steve Warren.\n\nThat leaves the channel between Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as the only semi-functioning high-level diplomatic channel between Washington and Moscow. But even that often-frosty relationship has further chilled as the two sides hurled insults and accusations this week.\n\nAfter speaking over the phone Monday and then again Tuesday about the now defunct Geneva agreement on Ukraine, Kerry and Lavrov are now conducting diplomacy through the press\u2014and leveling harsh and undiplomatic charges against one another.\n\nKerry appeared at the State Department press room Thursday afternoon to declare publicly that Russia was not keeping its word.\n\n\u201cFor seven days, Russia has refused to take a single concrete step in the right direction,\u201d Kerry scolded. \u201cNot a single Russian official, not one, has publicly gone on television in Ukraine and called on the separatists to support the Geneva agreement, to support the stand-down, to give up their weapons, and get out of the Ukrainian buildings. They have not called on them to engage in that activity. \u201c\n\nKerry also lashed out at Russia Today, the Kremlin-sponsored television network, which Kerry said spends all its time \u201cto propagandize and to distort what is happening or not happening in Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, in plain sight, Russia continues to fund, coordinate, and fuel a heavily armed separatist movement in Donetsk,\u201d Kerry accused.\n\nLavrov publicly responded, \u201cThe U.S. is trying to pervert everything that is going on in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Kerry summed up his recent interactions with his Russian counterpart, \u201cI\u2019ve had 6 conversations with Lavrov in the last few weeks. The last one was Kafka-esque... It was bizarre.\u201d\n\nU.S. and Western European officials, echoing Kerry, told The Daily Beast that new sanctions against Russia could come as early as Monday, following an EU meeting to endorse a list of 15 Russian individuals that will be targeted for new sanctions. The U.S. could also unveil new individuals for targeted sanctions on Monday, but while the U.S. list overlaps the EU list, the two lists are not identical.\n\nThe decision to move ahead with new sanctions, thereby pronouncing the death of the Geneva agreement and the current diplomatic process with Russia, was agreed on a Thursday night video conference call between President Obama (from Tokyo), Prime Minister Cameron, Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande and Prime Minister Renzi, several officials said.\n\n\u201cWhile they continued to hold open the door to a diplomatic resolution of this crisis, based on the Geneva agreement, the five leaders agreed that in the light of Russia\u2019s refusal to support the process, an extension of the current targeted sanctions would need to be implemented, in conjunction with other G7 leaders and with European partners,\u201d a spokesperson for Cameron\u2019s office said.\n\nThose targeted sanctions will still fall short of what many in Washington, including leading Democrats, are calling on the Obama administration to do. During a stop in Kiev Thursday, Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin said that the U.S. \u201cshould make more robust use of the powers established in Executive Order 13661, which authorizes sanctions against the Russian financial, energy, metals, mining, engineering, and defense sectors\u2026 and we should use this authority to sanction Russian banks\u2026 and to take on Russia\u2019s manipulation of energy prices and supplies, which it uses to coerce not only Ukraine, but also many of its neighbors.\u201d\n\nObama said Thursday there is a limit to the harm he wishes to see imposed on Putin. Asked during his stop in South Korea if he would save Putin from drowning, Obama said. \u201cI absolutely would save Mr. Putin if he were drowning. I\u2019d like to think that if anybody is out there drowning I\u2019m going to save them.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:51.368+0000"}
{"entityId": 1985, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Fully two-thirds of Congress\u2014with no partisan pattern at all\u2014voted to back the war request. So the support was broad\u2014but likely not deep.\n\nPerhaps they weren\u2019t great moments in congressional history, the roll-call votes this week in which the House and, yesterday evening, the Senate agreed to fund the Syria operation. But they were really fascinating\u2014as close as we\u2019ve ever come in my adult lifetime, at least that I can remember, to having true \u201cconscience votes.\u201d\n\nActually, that\u2019s a little too generous: While conscience played a part here, these people surely cast the votes that they thought would play best for them back in their home district or state. Even so, it was refreshing that, in an era totally dominated by party-line votes on questions of even the slightest controversy, there was no clear partisan explanation for the vote totals in the House and Senate.\n\nAmazing, also, that campaign politics doesn\u2019t seem to have figured into the votes too much. There were selected cases where the election loomed\u2014Democratic Sen. Mark Begich, up for reelection in red Alaska, voted against funding what would inevitably be dubbed by his GOP opponent in attack ads \u201cBarack Obama\u2019s War.\u201d But the proceedings certainly weren\u2019t dominated by the upcoming election, as the Iraq War vote was in October 2002. For example, in contrast to Begich, other red-state Democrats up for reelection\u2014North Carolina\u2019s Kay Hagan and Arkansas\u2019 Mark Pryor\u2014voted yes.\n\nWhat does all this show? For good or ill, these people do a pretty accurate job of representing how the country feels on an issue like this. So I think the votes show that the country basically supports the Obama plan, but less out of any sense of enthusiasm and more out of a kind resigned necessity and lack of any better ideas for the moment. That means the plan is going to have to work, or a lot of the people who were a \u201cyes\u201d this week are going to flip to being a \u201cno\u201d in the future. And the future is coming fast\u2014after the election, Congress is going to start talking about writing a new authorization for the use of military force against ISIS, and while the odds today are that it would pass, bad news could unravel this support in a hurry.\n\nA few notes on the unusual nature of the votes. The House roll call shows that Republicans gave the Syria funding higher support than Democrats did. Fully 69 percent of House Republicans voted yes (159-71), while 57 percent of Democrats backed it (114-85). In the Senate, where the measure passed 78-22, 82 percent of Democrats and 73 percent of Republicans backed it (I count here the two independents, Maine\u2019s Angus King and Vermont\u2019s Bernie Sanders, as Democrats, since they caucus with the Democrats; King voted for, Sanders against).\n\nYou would think most capital-L Liberals would have voted no. In the Senate, this was fairly true: Along with Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown voted no, although lots of pretty liberal senators\u2014Barbara Boxer, Barbara Mikulski, Jeff Merkley\u2014voted yes. But in the House, the 68 members of the Progressive Caucus split their vote exactly at 34-34.\n\nI think the most telling votes to look at are those cast by incumbents in tight reelection races. As the Begich, Hagan, and Pryor examples show, there\u2019s no clear line for incumbents to follow.\n\nOn the right, most of the Tea Party and ultraconservative types voted against Obama in both Houses (Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Ted Cruz, Tom Coburn, Michele Bachmann). But some pretty conservative legislators voted yes (Marco Rubio and David Vitter in the Senate, Marcia Blackburn in the House). John McCain and Lindsey Graham were a yes, of course, even though Obama\u2019s plan isn\u2019t warlike enough for their tastes.\n\nThere\u2019s not much rhyme or reason to it all, and that\u2019s precisely what makes these votes so fascinating. I think the most telling votes to look at are those cast by incumbents in tight reelection races. As the Begich, Hagan, and Pryor examples show, there\u2019s no clear line for incumbents to follow. The votes of two other incumbents in close races only deepen the mystery. New Hampshire Democrat Jean Shaheen, being challenged by Scott Brown, voted yes, while Kansas Republican Pat Roberts, who as of yesterday looks like he may well lose, voted no. Given their party affiliations and the demographic profiles of their states, I\u2019d probably have expected the opposite out of both of them.\n\nSo, for the time being, America is united. Obama emphasized this in his brief remarks last night after the Senate voted, and he was able to put a little meat on the bones of his coalition by announcing that France has agreed to undertake airstrikes alongside us (in Iraq, but apparently not in Syria). The vote will start the process that will send $500 million to the moderate opposition, and we\u2019ll see what they do with it.\n\nThe support was broad\u2014adding up all the votes, 66 percent of Congress said yes. But it\u2019s likely not deep. Obama is going to have to show Congress and the public successes. These aren\u2019t going to be (for a while at least) and should not be limited to battlefield successes. More specific information about what coalition partners are contributing, especially the Arab states; positive signs of Sunni inclusion from the new Iraqi government; a few flesh-and-blood examples of some actual Syrian moderates, to demonstrate to a doubting Congress and public that they do exist\u2014these are the kinds of public affirmations Obama should make, along with military strikes against ISIS. Congress might vote on the authorization of force measure as soon as December. The White House needs to spread some good\u2014and real\u2014news between now and then.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:51.605+0000"}

They\u2019re not done yet.\n\nFinally, you can give more than $123,000 to political parties, committees, and a bunch of candidates.\n\nThe Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision Wednesday in McCutcheon v. FEC overturned a law enacted after Watergate that allowed the federal government to cap how much an individual could give to multiple federal candidates and committees in a single campaign cycle.\n\nIn his majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts cited the Court\u2019s previous 5-4 ruling in 2010\u2019s Citizens United\u2014and that decision\u2019s creation of super PACs\u2014as reason to invalidate the aggregate limits. Roberts wrote in McCutcheon:\n\n\u201cThe existing aggregate limits may in fact encourage the movement of money away from entities subject to disclosure. Because individuals\u2019 direct contributions are limited, would-be donors may turn to other avenues for political speech.\u201d\n\nIn the dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer railed against the majority\u2019s decision. In a once rare, but increasingly common gesture, Breyer read from his dissent from the bench to signal his discontent with Roberts\u2019s opinion. Breyer argued:\n\n\u201cThe result, as I said at the outset, is a decision that substitutes judges\u2019 understandings of how the political process works for the understanding of Congress; that fails to recognize the difference between influence resting upon public opinion and influence bought by money alone; that overturns key precedent; that creates huge loopholes in the law; and that undermines, perhaps devastates, what remains of campaign finance reform.\u201d\n\nClarence Thomas called for the invalidation of any limits on campaign donations.\n\nBreyer also noted that McCutcheon, which was being appealed from a district court where it was promptly dismissed, shouldn\u2019t have even been decided but instead remanded back to the lower court for further evidence to be heard. The longtime justice, appointed by President Clinton, added a lengthy appendix of evidence he found relevant to his dissent.\n\nThe Court\u2019s holding is not likely to have as significant an effect on the political landscape as Citizens United did. The McCutcheon decision will allow individual donors to make direct contributions to an unlimited number of candidates and committees but still within the still existing individual donation limits. This means that combining candidates and party committees alone (and not donations to independent political action committees), individuals can now give at least $3.5 million in regular contributions. The decision will also mean that state limits on aggregate donations are likely to disappear in future cases, which could have even more significant and unanticipated effects.\n\nBut while the decision will allow more money to flow to parties and perhaps reduce the role of super PACs as a result, it\u2019s most important role is the signal it sends about the future of campaign finance law.\n\nThe Roberts Court has consistently rolled back limitations on campaign expenditures, and this decision marks the collapse of another part of the framework imposed by Congress after Watergate and greatly altered by the Court in the 1976 decision of Buckley v. Valeo. In his concurring opinion, Clarence Thomas called for the invalidation of any limits on campaign donations. Further, throughout his majority opinion, Roberts hailed how improvements in disclosure of contributions online made it that much easier to avoid the corruption, or the appearance of corruption, which campaign finance laws are meant to prevent.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the Court will suddenly strike down all limitations on campaign donations soon. Campaign finance laws won\u2019t die. Instead, like Douglas MacArthur\u2019s old soldier, it seems the Roberts Court will simply allow them to fade way.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:51.831+0000"}

So why do they keep holding a major event on the Jewish holidays?\n\nFor all the effort that the conservative movement has put into trying to woo Jewish voters, the timing of the Values Voter Summit, one of the top conservative events of the year, has been a real shanda.\n\nThe summit, organized by the Family Research Council, has been held for the past nine years in either September or October at the Omni Shoreham hotel in Washington, D.C. The problem is that, in the eight times that the event has been held, it has coincided three times with Rosh Hashanah and twice with Yom Kippur. The event is coming back to D.C. this weekend, where it will once again conflict with Rosh Hashanah.\n\nBethany Mandel, a former editor at the conservative Commentary, first pointed out this unhappy coincidence on Twitter. Mandel told The Daily Beast that the timing of the conference was very \u201cfrustrating.\u201d In her opinion, \u201ca lot of the Value Voter's positions could align with those of Jews, particularly the Orthodox.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvangelicals, and conservatives in general, are really limiting themselves by not looking outside the box and seeking Orthodox Jewish support on common ground issues\u201d\n\nMandel noted \u201cthere's a general unease among Jews about becoming involved in conservative politics and with Christians in particular, because they feel unwelcome and nervous about people just trying to convert them.\u201d Needless to say, scheduling major events on the Jewish High Holidays does nothing to assuage those concerns.\n\n\u201cEvangelicals, and conservatives in general, are really limiting themselves by not looking outside the box and seeking Orthodox Jewish support on common ground issues,\u201d she said.\n\nBut not all Jewish conservatives seemed to mind. Noah Pollak, the executive director of the Emergency Committee for Israel, shrugged off the issue. \u201cThe organizers and attendees of the Values Voter Summit are not just strongly pro-Israel, but genuinely pro-Jewish as well,\u201d said Pollak. \u201cThe world would be a better place if more people felt about Jews the way those associated with the Values Voter Summit do and I wish them a successful conference this year.\"\n\nThe Family Research Council, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment, is almost certainly not doing this on purpose. The vagaries of the Jewish calendar, after all, mean that many observant Jews have a difficult time remembering what days that the high holidays fall on. This is not to mention that, regardless of what weekend the conference is held, that most Orthodox Jews would not be able to attend on Shabbos.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a misstep for a conservative movement that has long kvetched about its inability to woo Jewish voters. Adjusting the date of a conference wouldn\u2019t suddenly change voting patterns among a demographic that, in the words of the late Jewish neoconservative essayist Milton Himmelfarb, \u201cearn like Episcopalians and vote like Puerto Ricans.\u201d But it would be better than doing bupkis.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:52.056+0000"}

In 2008, Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich, who had served a tumultuous single term as mayor of Cleveland in the 70\u2019s, introduced articles of impeachment against Bush and Vice President Cheney, charging them in 35 separate articles with disobeying international law, taking the country to war with misleading and false information, and a host of violations in how the war was conducted.\n\n\u201cI brought it with no small degree of trepidation,\u201d Kucinich recalled in a lengthy phone conversation with the Daily Beast. \u201cHe was always personally very decent to me. This is not something I took any pleasure in. I thought it was important for the American people to be aware we were sent into war based on falsehoods.\u201d\n\nBased on his experience as a lawmaker who sought impeachment as a remedy, Kucinich is candid about warning Republicans what they would unleash, and why launching impeachment proceedings against President Obama would be bad for the country, and bad for the Republican Party.\n\nKucinich\u2019s lonely quest was short-circuited by the Democratic leadership, which used the media to convey the message. Asked if Speaker Pelosi \u201cshut him down,\u201d Kucinich said no: \u201cI was never asked not to proceed. They made it clear in the media it wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\n\nRepublican leaders today are doing the same thing, using the media to tell their members there will be no impeachment. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d says Kucinich. \u201cYou have to look at it practically.\u201d It\u2019s not politically smart, it\u2019s not in the interest of the country, and it remains to be seen if the articles that would be brought forward are sufficient, he says.\n\nHe hears lots of loose talk but no apparent understanding of the arduous process, the hearings that would have to scrutinize each article, and the partisan feelings that would be unleashed on all sides. Is that worth it for a president who will be out the door in two years? Do the Republicans want to alienate important constituencies they will need in 2016? \u201cImpeachment is a riveting event in the history of the country,\u201d Kucinich says. \u201cEverything else stops, it freezes the country. It\u2019s not in the Republican Party\u2019s interest to do that.\u201d\n\nAsked if Speaker Pelosi \u201cshut him down,\u201d Kucinich said no: \u201cI was never asked not to proceed. They made it clear in the media it wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s always possible for any member to introduce an article of impeachment, and you only need one, you don\u2019t need a hundred, Kucinich says, he doesn\u2019t see Republicans being willing to de-stabilize the government\u2014\u201cand if they go forward with impeachment they would be seen as de-stabilizing the government. That\u2019s why you\u2019re not going to see a shutdown,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey would be seen as unable to govern.\u201d\n\nAnd if the GOP wants to take the presidency in 2016, an impeachment effort or a shutdown \u201cwould raise questions about whether the Republican Party has the ability to put a steady hand on the wheel of the ship of state,\u201d says Kucinich, though he adds the qualifier that if a presidential act surfaces that is \u201cso egregious it can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d that they have act, so be it.\n\nKucinich says he talked with \u201chundreds of people who understand the Constitution and the historical meaning of the facts\u201d to build his case. \u201cThis took years, it was not a kneejerk reaction to one thing. It was years in the making.\u201d At one point he had 100 counts before winnowing it down to 35.\n\n\u201cI was not shopping it like some bill that deserves support,\u201d he recalls, emphasizing it was a legal document that needed to be above partisan politics. Asked what kind of support he got from rank-and-file Democrats, he paused before replying with a hearty laugh. \u201cI had a lot of quiet support, very quiet.\u201d\n\nAsked if he sees any parallels between the articles he filed and what the Republicans might be contemplating, he said no, that his suit grew out of his involvement in challenging the Iraq war, and the false justification for that war, and he says he felt no personal animus against Bush. The Republicans he believes are driven at least in part by their intense dislike of Obama.\n\nMotivation aside, a recent poll about executive power and whether Obama has gone too far and should be impeached mirrors the results of polls that asked the same questions in 2006 about President Bush. Then, 48 percent said Bush had gone too far, 34 percent said he was about right, and 14 percent said not far enough. The numbers for Obama are 48 percent too far, 29 percent about right, and 21 percent not far enough.\n\nIn September 2006, 30 percent said Bush should be impeached and 69 percent said they didn\u2019t feel that way. For Obama, 29 percent say he should be impeached; 70 percent don\u2019t feel that way.\n\nRepublican efforts to defund the implementation of Obama\u2019s executive order on immigration, and the party\u2019s ongoing attempt to deny sufficient funds to implement Obamacare are rooted in the separation of powers. \u201cAnytime Congress funds the actions or the policies of a president, it\u2019s endorsing those policies,\u201d Kucinich says.\n\nNancy Pelosi voted against the Iraq war but as Speaker of the House, she backed President Bush\u2019s requests to fund the war, often framing it as supporting the troops. She held that position despite considerable opposition from the anti-war left, including protests outside her home in San Francisco. Reminded of Pelosi\u2019s position, Kucinich said with measured calm, \u201cWith all due respect to Representative Pelosi, whom I\u2019ve known forever and I consider a friend, PLEASE\u2014You support the troops by bringing them home, not keeping them in the field on a mission that was not based on fact.\n\n\u201cOne of the great pretenses in American politics is that we stay at war to support the troops, That is on its face so fallacious and so cynical and dismissive of the troops that it stands as a glaring admission of complicity in the war.

The Clintons and the de Blasios could be seeing a lot of each other in the coming months.\n\nThat\u2019s because Clinton is on the cusp of another campaign for president, one in which she finds herself as the overwhelming favorite for the nomination but facing deep skepticism from some corners of the party who doubt her commitment to a progressive, populist agenda.\n\nThe leader of that charge, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, isn\u2019t likely to run herself but has historically been a decided Clinton skeptic, singling the former secretary of state out for criticism in one of her books and expressing surprise at Clinton\u2019s email scandal.\n\nDe Blasio, meanwhile, is not just running New York City but vying to become a major voice of the ascendant left himself. Could he become Clinton\u2019s go-to surrogate to progressives and liberal groups? Such a move could benefit them both, convincing Clinton\u2019s nervous left flank of her liberal bonafides while giving the mayor the platform he appears to crave.\n\n\u201cI do think it would be helpful,\u201d said Bertha Lewis, the head of the Black Institute and a longtime de Blasio ally. \u201cLook, he is the mayor of a city that is the center of the universe. I mean, New York City! Seriously! A progressive that won talking about income inequality and that fought the 1 percent who he dragged home kicking and screaming over the possibility of his mayoralty. He has a lot of cred with progressives. He was not supposed to win this. This is where the 1 percent live. So hell, yeah!\u201d\n\nAll New York City mayoralties are about something beyond just running a city. Rudy Giuliani became the national spokesman for new tough-on-crime measures. Mike Bloomberg toured the country promoting political independence.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s New York is meant to stand as proof that government can address major progressive priorities and still function effectively, and he has not been bashful about making that point, traveling as far afield as Manchester, England, to address a Labour Party conference about the politics of income inequality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about who can whisper to the candidate and do the pillow talk. It\u2019s who is out there as the surrogate. The mayor is going to be on the record.\u201d\n\nThis month, de Blasio is scheduled to travel to Iowa and Nebraska to push the point. After the Democrats\u2019 midterm drubbing in November, he wrote a scathing op-ed in the Huffington Post in which he warned the Democratic Party against going wobbly: \u201cDon\u2019t Soul-Search. Stiffen Your Backbone,\u201d read the headline.\n\nBut despite all this, de Blasio still lacks Warren\u2019s punch. When progressive groups like Democracy for America or MoveOn.org send out mailers or hold rally-the-troops conference calls with their members, it is Warren who is featured, not de Blasio. There is no \u201cDraft de Blasio\u201d movement to speak of, though four out of the last six New York City mayors have at least flirted with running for president.\n\nLast month, de Blasio met with Clinton privately at her foundation headquarters, the news site Capital New York reported. His Brooklyn home is blocks away from her likely campaign headquarters, and even though no campaign surrogacy has been scheduled\u2014there is, after all, not yet a Clinton campaign\u2014Phil Walzak, his senior adviser, told The Daily Beast that \u201cMayor de Blasio intends to use his voice and the bully pulpit to encourage Democrats to embrace progressive values and a progressive vision. The mayor will also demonstrate that you can pursue a progressive agenda in a municipal setting and still have an effective, well-run city.\u201d\n\nPolitical strategists say Clinton needs someone who can energize the liberal base while she tries to position herself for a general election and avoid antagonizing the Wall Street types that fund presidential campaigns.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be a fake-ass Republican. You just can\u2019t be. The game has changed,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cIt\u2019s not about who can whisper to the candidate and do the pillow talk. It\u2019s who is out there as the surrogate. The mayor is going to be on the record.\u201d\n\nAnd if there are any concerns that de Blasio fears tarnishing his political brand by championing a moderate, one need only recall the 2014 midterms, when de Blasio rushed to the full-throated defense of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo against a progressive challenger. Cuomo, like Clinton, is a longtime friend of the mayor\u2019s but also has seemingly taken great sport in toying with his party\u2019s progressive wing. No matter. De Blasio was even one of the first politicians to endorse Cuomo\u2019s choice for lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, a pro-gun, tough-on-immigrants former congresswoman, calling her \u201ca true progressive.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s and de Blasio\u2019s political careers have been practically intertwined since they both began in New York. She plucked him from obscurity to run her unlikely 2000 Senate campaign. He then used the chits and contacts he acquired to run for the City Council the next year, and 13 years later for mayor. And when de Blasio was sworn in as mayor, standing alongside him on the dais was Hillary Clinton.

{"entityId": 1990, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Why money needs to be easier, not harder, for politicians to raise now.\n\nThe morning after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling in McCutcheon v. FEC brings progressives a splitting headache. The 5-4 ruling along the usual conservative-liberal lines, while not unexpected, has broad implications. Like it or not\u2014and assuredly, progressive do not like it\u2014the era of effective limits on contributions to federal politicians is drawing to a close. Want to write a million-dollar check to support a candidate? Chances are that now, or someday soon, you can.\n\nFor four decades, since the campaign finance reforms of the 1970s, limits on big-dollar, direct gifts to politicians have been the beating heart of the progressive paradigm. Before McCutcheon, donors could give only $2,600 to an individual candidate in any one election cycle\u2014and they could only give an aggregate of $48,600 to all campaigns. (Here\u2019s the whole list of contribution limits.) In McCutcheon, the court struck down the aggregate limit, reversing its own prior holding in the seminal 1976 case Buckley v. Valeo.\n\nTo be sure, the legal limit on contributions to individual candidates remains in place (for the time being; it will be challenged). But it will now be \u201cchild\u2019s play,\u201d as the Campaign Legal Center notes (PDF), \u201cto transfer multiple contributions from a single donor between party and candidate committees for the purpose of directing all or part of the total amount to the donor\u2019s preferred recipients.\u201d\n\nA calamity for the 1970s paradigm? Yes. A calamity for progressives? Maybe not. There is a way forward, a potential win for both freedom and political accountability, though it requires progressives to hold their nose and swallow hard: raise contribution limits. A lot. A whole lot. Like, allow contributions of up to $1 million for presidential campaigns and up to $200,000 and $50,000, respectively, for Senate and House campaigns. (In 2012, an average winning Senate campaign spent $10.4 million, and a winning House campaign spent $1.6 million, according to Vital Statistics on Congress.)At the same time, as part of the deal, close the wide gaps in today\u2019s rules requiring the disclosure of donations.\n\nWait. Allow Senate candidates to hit up victims\u2014sorry, donors\u2014for $200,000 at a time? Legitimize contributions of a size that virtually guarantees special attention from office-holders? Why should progressives conceivably support that? Because the old means no longer serve the desired ends. As of now, the case for low contribution limits has all but evaporated\u2014even if you believe, as I do, that the limits once made sense and that the Buckley court was correct in upholding them.\n\nThe Buckley rationale was that contribution limits prevent corruption, and the appearance of corruption, by keeping donations small enough to obviate pay-for-play and political racketeering. Politicians would raise modest amounts from multiple donors; fat cats would lose clout; the public would gain confidence that the system wasn\u2019t hostage to plutocrats.\n\nOver time, however, as electioneering costs soared, low contribution limits had the unintended effect of making money hard to raise. The need to raise large amounts in small sums is a reason (not the only one, of course) that politicians spend far too much time every day dialing for dollars.\n\nThe need to raise large amounts in small sums is a reason (not the only one, of course) that politicians spend far too much time every day dialing for dollars.\n\nMeanwhile, as the pipelines to candidates and parties became more like drinking straws, donations migrated to other, less restrictive channels. Cue the super PACs, independent political groups that spend unlimited amounts of money but are not under the control of candidates or parties. They are less transparent than candidates and parties, and they are not politically accountable to anyone but themselves (you can\u2019t vote them out of office). And then cue the 501(c)(4) nonprofits, which are also unaccountable and almost totally opaque, as conduits for secret giving.\n\nThese entities\u2019 deep pockets and readiness to bankroll ad blitzes and primary challenges often intimidate politicians more than direct givers ever could. And, thanks to other recent court decisions (notably Citizens United and SpeechNow), they are hard to regulate. If that were not enough, even a liberal Supreme Court would have trouble regulating mega-rich individual donors such as Sheldon Adelson and the Koch Brothers, whose right to use seemingly limitless amounts their own money to speak out about politics implicates the very core of the First Amendment.\n\nProgressives who hope, in 2014, to regulate their way out of this problem need a reality check. Even if they could change the court or the Constitution, the past several decades have shown that money cuts new channels when old ones are blocked. And the new channels tend to be underground, indirect, and unaccountable. McCutcheon threatens to add yet more obfuscation and circumvention, as million-dollar donations are broken up into small parcels, laundered through joint fundraising committees and multiple campaigns and cross-donations, and reassambled as\u2026million-dollar donations. (The Campaign Legal Center explains nicely how this could work (PDF).)\n\nSo now what? If the burgeoning gray market in political money is to be countered, a few things need to happen. First, political money needs to be made easier, not harder, for politicians to raise. Second, the money needs to be encouraged to flow through channels that are ultimately accountable to voters and the national interest. Third, candidate and party donations need to flow in straightforward, observable ways rather than being routed circuitously, so that everyone can see what\u2019s going on and vote or campaign accordingly. Fourth, disclosure needs to be improved for the nonprofits and other black holes.\n\nGreatly raising contribution limits and simultaneously improving disclosure would achieve those goals. High limits would affect only the most stratospheric contributions, the ones that raise the most serious questions about corruption; other donors could bring their money back into the mainstream system in an above-board way. Voters might not like it, but at least they could see it and, if they chose, vote against it. With money inside the political system, candidates and parties would have more control over their own campaigns and destinies.\n\nYes, big donations buy access and influence. Yes, high limits tempt politicians to squeeze donors mercilessly for money. But if you think the existing system puts a stop to that, I refer you to the Adelson Primary the other day in Las Vegas, where Republican hopefuls lined up to curry favor with the gambling magnate. And in today\u2019s era of presidential races that cost more than $1 billion and Senate races that top $20 million, even quite large contributions, short of the eye-popping level, are too small to make a candidate kiss the donor\u2019s ring. With so much money out there in federal politics now (more than $6 billion in 2012), big is the new small.\n\nA further advantage of raising contribution limits and tightening disclosure rules: it is a politically viable trade. Democrats want to tighten disclosure laws (as with the proposed DISCLOSE Act) but have blocked raising contribution limits. Republicans want to raise contribution limits (as Mitt Romney, for example, suggested) but have blocked more disclosure. In other words, each side has a hostage to trade. Unless the Supreme Court has convinced Republicans they can pick up all the marbles just by standing pat (a real possibility, alas), there is a deal to be done.\n\nAnd yet a further advantage: greatly raising contribution limits may be the best way to persuade the Supreme Court to retain them. Today\u2019s low limits have a constitutional bull\u2019s-eye painted on their back, because they so tightly circumscribe donors\u2019 ability to influence the political process\u2014something the court\u2019s conservatives plainly do not like. Very high limits, allowing the vast majority of donors to give as much as they want straightforwardly, may offer the best chance of persuading the court\u2019s majority to preserve Buckley\u2019s principle that there can be some reasonable upper bound on political giving.\n\nAnd so, to make politics more accountable and ultimately cleaner, progressives need to consider a counterintuitive proposition: the way forward is to bring more big money back inside the political system. In politics, as in war, strategic wisdom sometimes requires abandoning even the most cherished of means to achieve an essential end.

He had a record as attorney general of cleaning up Wall Street and the ethical cesspool that is Albany, and in his brief tenure in office seemed to have scared the statehouse straight, passing on-time budgets and successfully pushing for landmark marriage equality legislation. And Hillary Clinton, the now all-but certain Democratic nominee, was still playing the role of loyal underling to President Barack Obama, and denying that she was interested in mounting another campaign.\n\nFive years later, Hillary Clinton barnstormed back to her home state of New York to boost Cuomo\u2019s re-election bid against underdog Republican challenger Rob Astorino.\n\nBut the question of Clinton\u2019s own future campaign seemed to be much more on the minds of the 500 or so Democratic partisans who piled into a ballroom at the Hyatt Hotel in midtown Manhattan. The event was ostensibly a \u201cWoman for Cuomo\u201d event, designed to highlight his agenda for female voters. But no sooner had Clinton taken the microphone from Cuomo running mate Kathy Hochul than the crowd began chanting \u201c2016! 2016\u201d\n\nClinton paid tribute to Cuomo, who served eight years in President Bill Clinton\u2019s Department of Housing and Urban Development, framing the election as one that was about what kind of state she wants her newborn granddaughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, to grow up in.\n\n\u201cI am now a grandmother,\u201d she said to hoots from the audience. \u201cI still feel that grandmother glow. There is something about a new life in your family that really does focus you on the future, doesn\u2019t it? And I believe strongly that I want our granddaughter to have the same opportunity that gave Bill in Arkansas, me growing up in the Chicago area, the chance to take advantage of the blessings and the advantages we have in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take anything for granted in an election. I know that from first-hand experience,\u201d\n\nClinton praised Cuomo\u2019s commitment to marriage equality\u2014a subject she has gotten tripped up on earlier this year\u2014as well as Cuomo\u2019s controversial gun control measures, which have come under fire from both gun rights supporters and those who say they stigmatize people who have received counseling for mental illness.\n\nClinton also poked fun at her own electoral troubles in 2008 in urging New Yorkers to turn out for Cuomo even though he has a wide lead in the polls.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take anything for granted in an election. I know that from first-hand experience,\u201d she said to laughs.\n\nBy the time Cuomo got up to speak, many of the audience members, who had been waiting for the event to begin for over an hour after its scheduled start time, began to file out. The governor told the remaining members of the audience however that when he is asked what Clinton will do, he responds by saying that Clinton \u201cis so good, that whatever she does, she is going to be an overwhelming success.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there is a post-script to that line which I will share with you today,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I hope she does something really, really big.\u201d\n\nTo this, Clinton, seated on stage, merely turned up her palms and shrugged.\n\nAfter the event, Cuomo was asked by reporters if that meant he is endorsing Clinton. And even though dozens of elected officials have joined Ready for Hillary, a SuperPAC encouraging Clinton to enter the race, Cuomo said he was not joining the effort.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton can\u2019t be endorsed, because Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t said if she is running for anything. She would have to announce that she is running and then people would have to choose to support her or not.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by a public radio why Cuomo sounded as if he was encouraging Clinton to run, he smiled and dismissed the suggestion.\n\n\u201cThat might be a radio reporter. That is big. A TV reporter is big. These are all big things.\u201d\n\nClinton was gone by that point, however, gone to campaign on behalf of more Democratic candidates who need her help.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:52.992+0000"}

It\u2019s not enough that the video shows Clinton performing standard famous-person duties with above-average grace (if not exactly ease); no, it has to be revelatory proof\u2014and not proof of something true about Clinton herself, but of how people feel about her.\n\nHillary\u2019s public relations battles have, for decades now, been fought in that strange meta arena: We argue not about who she is, but about how people perceive her. We don\u2019t debate whether she is genuine, but if people think she is.\n\nTo some extent, this is the default context for all political punditry. It is always easier to debate a nation\u2019s mood than to do the hard work of sussing out its needs. But Hillary Clinton is an especially provocative case, in part because her campaigns and advisers, again and again, choose to meet the pundits and the media in that Thunderdome of perception rather than in the real world. Even when they want to fight in the real world, they beg for a decision about perception: How do Brooklyn residents feel?\n\nThe Brooklyn video is, after all, yet another introduction of Hillary.

There is a talented administrator and passionate advocate behind every re-applied \u201cHello, my name is\u2026\u201d sticker on her pantsuit.\n\nVoters saw the woman behind the marketing campaign during the Lewinsky scandal, during her nose-to-the-grindstone turns in the Senate and State Department, and, most dramatically, between the cracks of the fa\u00e7ade during the 2008 campaign.\n\nHer moment of peak cultural penetration came with the \u201cHillary texting\u201d meme: a photo snapped of her unawares, immersed in a task, completely apart from the conversation we might have about her and exerting no control over it.\n\nPolls attest to how well Americans respond when Hillary stops shaking hands and just gets to work. These data points should direct her campaign away from telling us how to feel about her and instead to just letting her be herself.\n\nIronically, the other \u201cnew\u201d Hillary video out last week was also a re-introduction of sorts\u2014perhaps the very first: a half-hour interview from 1979 with young Hillary Rodham, recently having becoming the First Lady of Arkansas.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to pick apart what about the video doesn\u2019t \u201cwork\u201d for today\u2019s audiences. Mostly, it\u2019s the style, a preserved-in-acetate disco-librarian look: owlish glasses, Pepto-pink blazer and full skirt, and white turtleneck (though, the knee-high boots are pretty bitchin\u2019).\n\nBut it\u2019s really only the style that grates on a modern sensibility.\n\nThe interview itself is shockingly civil, though not without an undercurrent of sexism that dates the conversation. The public television host asks Ms. Rodham about keeping her name\u2014\u201cit lost [your husband] some votes\u201d\u2014and asserts that, \u201cIf you just wouldn\u2019t be a practicing attorney, you see, then that would eliminate some of the problems of not being together.\u201d He notes she doesn\u2019t seem \u201call that interested in state dinners and teas and garden parties.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s refreshing is how Ms. Rodham responds. She is straightforward but not chilly; she doesn\u2019t agree but doesn\u2019t argue\u2014on the garden party front, she says, \u201cI\u2019m interested in everything. I\u2019m interested in social events and civic events, as well as my own professional life.\u201d\n\nPressed on the issue of her keeping her name, asked if that maybe makes people consider her \u201ctoo liberal,\u201d she tells the interviewer, \u201cOne cannot live one\u2019s life based on what somebody else\u2019s image of you might be\u2026 All one can do is live the life that God gave you, and you know you just do the best you can, and if somebody likes you or doesn\u2019t like you that\u2019s really in many ways something that you have no control over.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the answer of someone who only needs to introduce herself once.\n\nSo what happened to her? Bill lost re-election after that first term. The defeat reportedly crushed them both, and when he ran again in 1982, his partner on the stump wasn\u2019t Ms. Rodham, but Mrs. Clinton. There is no way to read that change and not see at least a few grains of cynicism\u2014the same moral calculation that the Clintons have used to justify or excuse almost every twist in image or message since then.\n\nIn 1982, it worked. Bill won, his career continued to careen forward, and the lesson they took from that cynical rebranding has never been unlearned\u2014though I can\u2019t help wonder if it was the wrong lesson. Was it, after all, her rebranding as \u201cClinton\u201d that \u201cworked,\u201d or did Hillary Rodham\u2019s talents sway people, because she was that self-assured young woman in the kick-ass boots? Who did people see? Which Hillary are they actually supporting today?\n\nMaybe she does need to reintroduce herself.

Not for these three governors.\n\nLaugh off the investigation. Ignore it. Or shake your ass with Jimmy Fallon. Three governors who have been seriously floated as possible contenders for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 are under investigation in their home states. How they are coping varies dramatically. Texas Governor Rick Perry seems to have benefited from his troubles; New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was declared dead and is now bobbing back into the running; and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has mostly stayed quiet, perhaps thinking that ignoring the scandal will make it go away.\n\nIt is important, former Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards told me, that the candidates \u201cdon\u2019t dodge or evade.\u201d Instead, he advised them to, \u201cstep up to the plate. Tell it like it is\u2014especially if it\u2019s going to come out later from somebody else. It\u2019s important that you admit it, and if you\u2019ve done something wrong, to ask for understanding and forgiveness. If you haven\u2019t done anything wrong, you need to explain your position.\u201d\n\nAnd Edwards would know.\n\nEdwards (who was governor for a total of sixteen, staggered years from 1972 to 1996) was long-dogged by charges of corruption. He was also known for his candor in addressing them. Asked about receiving illegal campaign contributions, he once said: \u201cIt was illegal for them to give, but not for me to receive.\u201d In 1991, having lost his bid for reelection, Edwards declared his candidacy against David Duke, who was revealed to be a neo-Nazi. Bumper stickers supporting Edwards read, \u201cVOTE FOR THE CROOK. IT\u2019S IMPORTANT.\u201d Edwards won. In 2001, Edwards was found guilty on charges of racketeering and sentenced to ten years in Federal prison. Ahead of entering the Big House in Fort Worth, Texas, he told the press: \u201cI will be a model prisoner as I was a model citizen.\u201d Edwards is now running for Congress in Louisiana\u2019s 6th district.\n\n\u201cI just made fun of people who wanted to say things about me or investigate me, because I knew I was not going to get in any kind of trouble,\u201d Edwards told me of his surviving-scandal-playbook.\n\nAnd so we have Perry.\n\nWhen a Democratic District Attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, refused to resign following her arrest for a DUI and belligerent behavior toward her arresting officers (all of which was caught on tape) Perry publicly threatened to veto funding for a powerful investigations unit that she controlled. It was the threat, not the veto itself, that prosecutors believe violated the law. In mid-August, after a year-long investigation, Perry was indicted on charges of abuse of power and coercion of a public official, first and third degree felonies, respectively.\n\nPerry has not exactly been apologetic.\n\nThe governor\u2019s strategy to save face has been to demonize Lehmberg, and to laugh the whole thing off. Perry released an ad featuring the deeply embarrassing footage of Lehmberg\u2019s arrest, wherein she is placed in a restraining chair and made to wear a mask. When he turned himself in, he wore a smirk in his mug shot, and then he went out for ice cream with reporters in tow. And not long after his mug shot went viral, Perry\u2019s political action committee, RickPAC, began selling t-shirts that featured it on the front, with the caption \u201cWANTED,\u201d and Lehmberg\u2019s decidedly less attractive mug shot on the back, with the caption, \u201cGUILTY.\u201d Perry posted a link to purchase the t-shirts on Twitter.\n\nEdwards approved of Perry\u2019s strategy. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good way to do it. He feels like he\u2019s been politicized in the legal system, and I think that\u2019s the way to treat it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Perry indictments have worked in his favor,\u201d David Gergen, a veteran of the Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton administrations, and professor of public service at the Harvard Kennedy School, told me. \u201cThe Texas indictments have energized the campaign and given him a story to tell. He was looking for a pony to ride in this race, and he may have found one for the next lap or two.\u201d Perry has also benefited from the fact that the national media\u2014the right-wing and the left-wing\u2014seem to be in his corner.\n\nChristie\u2019s method for coping with scandal has been more complicated.\n\nIn January, the seemingly-local issue of lane closings on the George Washington Bridge, which created a massive traffic jam in the Hudson River town of Fort Lee, became one of national interest when it was revealed that one of Christie\u2019s closest staffers had ordered them\u2014for what looked like political retribution against a Democratic mayor. The scandal was quickly dubbed \u201cBridgegate,\u201d and unfortunately for Christie, it played into his reputation as a bully.\n\n\u201cIf somebody comes along who\u2019s a likably rogue? People just think \u2018oh, it\u2019s just him. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 It can actually play in their favor.\u201d\n\nChristie\u2019s response was to act unlike himself: humble.\n\nThough he consistently denied his own involvement or knowledge of the event, he apologized. He held a never-ending press conference, wherein he answered every question\u2014after that, he was able to answer questions about the scandal by saying he had already answered all of them. Christie has since largely ignored the several investigations (including one by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey and one by the U.S. Attorney in New York) into his and his administration\u2019s behavior, traveling to states like Illinois and Iowa and not even facing a single question about Bridgegate. Christie even made his way back onto late night television, where he had, pre-scandal, been a constant presence, to dance with Jimmy Fallon\u2014comically walking off stage when Fallon began to perform a dance titled \u201cThis Bridge Is Closed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if you get combative and overly objecting, people are going to begin to get suspicious,\u201d Edwards told me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s not a essential, I think having a sense of humor and a sense of self deprecation is good in politics.\u201d\n\nOne Republican consultant wondered how long Bridgegate will linger. He explained, \u201cAll great scandals have to involve money or sex. Christie\u2019s dealt with traffic,\u201d but Christie\u2019s opponents will benefit from the \u201cclassic question: does [the scandal] play into a known stereotype?\u201d\n\nComparatively, Walker\u2019s scandal has not made many headlines. Prosecutors in the Badger State allege that he was part of a \u201ccriminal scheme\u201d to coordinate conservative groups that spent money to help him defeat the effort to recall him as governor. Walker, who is running for reelection, has not been charged, and has called the allegations \u201ccategorically false.\u201d He seems to have largely stayed out of the national media spotlight\u2014though he made an appearance on Twitter, wearing fingerless leather gloves and eating an ice cream cone.\n\n\u201cWalker\u2019s troubles haven\u2019t registered on the national landscape much,\u201d Gergen noted. But as one Republican consultant put it, \u201cThere is a drip drip.\u201d A feeling that \u201cthis isn\u2019t the first time Walker\u2019s had a problem\u2014that\u2019s problematic.\u201d\n\n***\n\nWhen a candidates flaws are seen as an endearing part of who they are, scandal can make them more attractive, Gergen argued. \u201cAmericans have broken both ways on rogues. They don\u2019t like some rogues\u2026But if somebody comes along who\u2019s likably rogue? People just think \u2018oh, it\u2019s just him. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 It can actually play in their favor.\u201d\n\nGergen used Bill Clinton, his former boss, as an example. \u201cRepublicans overplayed their hand,\u201d and in cases like that, people are more likely to \u201cgive them a break and see them as a victim more than a culprit.\u201d\n\nCertainly in Perry\u2019s case, he seems to have tapped into the populist view that the system is broken and rigged against people. \u201cWe\u2019re living in an age where the populism, the frustration with the system is very high and those who can claim to be victimized by the system, they can get a lot of help by fighting back. But there have been other times in our history where anybody who had a brush with the law was going to have a lot of trouble. After watergate, you would not want to run in the position any of these three guys is in right now.\u201d\n\nBut that may not be an effective long-term strategy.\n\n\u201cEverything is good until it\u2019s not good. That works until you\u2019re convicted. Once you\u2019re convicted, it\u2019s a problem,\u201d said the Republican strategist. As noted above, Christie remains under investigation by various entities in various states. Due to the secretive nature of U.S. Attorney investigations, no one knows for sure what areas of Christie\u2019s record are being prodded. And if any of the investigations were to result in an indictment it remains unclear whether or not Christie would be able to make it work for him like Perry has. And to fight off that indictment, Perry has hired a team of political consultants and criminal lawyers. \u201cThe one thing people underestimate is the degree to which this stuff consumes you,\u201d the Republican strategist explained. Surviving scandal requires a lot of time, money, and energy\u2014that\u2019s on top of running a campaign.\n\nAnd as 2016 inches closer, attacks will get more pointed\u2014and will likely attempt to relate the scandals to broader patterns of behavior in the governors.\n\nBut it may be nothing a good bumper sticker can\u2019t fix. Asked what his would say if he were in the place of Perry, Christie, or Walker, Edwards took a few seconds to think. \u201cVOTE FOR RICK. IT\u2019S A TRICK,\u201d \u201cVOTE FOR CHRISTIE. HE\u2018S THE HEAVYWEIGHT.\u201d And as for Walker, \u201cI could probably think of one,\u201d but nothing came to mind.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:53.991+0000"}

Congress has reauthorized the provisions of the VRA four times\u2014most recently in 2006, under the leadership of George W. Bush and with bipartisan support from Congress. The House supported the measure 390-33 and the Senate unanimously approved the legislation 98-0. So why reauthorize the VRA now, and why should Eric Cantor be the driving force?\n\nThe strength of this landmark law is contained within Section 5\u2014whose provisions mandate that covered jurisdictions (nine States and several counties that had been found to discriminate in the past) in the United States must submit any proposed changes in voting procedures to the Department of Justice prior to doing so\u2014the so-called \u201cpre-clearance provision.\u201d Last year, the Supreme Court held in Shelby County v. Holder.\n\n\n\nthat the manner in which the federal government determined which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance was unconstitutional.\n\nThe bottom line? While the Court did not invalidate Section 5, it did rule Section 4(b) unconstitutional. Section 4(b) sets out the formulas for determining what jurisdictions can be covered under the law. Without those formulas, Section 5 can\u2019t be enforced, so Section 5 has effectively been halted\u2014until Congress steps in to rewrite the formulas, reflecting the progress we\u2019ve made in the past 50 years to eliminate discrimination at the ballot box.\n\nHere\u2019s where Cantor comes in: while many have focused on his strong connections to K Street, his efforts to promote civil rights have largely been overlooked. Cantor traveled to Selma, Alabama with civil rights hero Representative John Lewis (D-GA) last year and offered the following observations immediately following the Shelby ruling last year:\n\nMy experience with John Lewis in Selma earlier this year was a profound experience that demonstrated the fortitude it took to advance civil rights and ensure equal protection for all. I\u2019m hopeful Congress will put politics aside, as we did on that trip, and find a responsible path forward that ensures that the sacred obligation of voting in this country remains protected.\n\nWhile many have focused on Cantor\u2019s strong connections to K Street, his efforts to promote civil rights have largely been overlooked.\n\nRepresentative Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) and Senate Judiciary Chairman Pat Leahy (D-VT), in an effort to update the VRA, have introduced two companion bills in the House and Senate. Many conservatives have opposed these bills as they claim minorities will be protected at the expense of whites.\n\nWhile Cantor has not commented directly on Sensenbrenner\u2019s bill, he\u2019s widely been seen as an ally based on supportive comments he has made about the topic generally. His leadership is needed to forge a compromise that will allow this important law to be updated before his departure as majority leader on July 31. I spoke to John Feehery, former senior advisor and spokesman to Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL), about how Republicans were able to push the bill through the House and Senate for President Bush\u2019s signature in 2006.\n\n\u201cHastert pushed it with Sensenbrenner as it was good politics and the right thing to do,\u201d Feehery explained. \u201cHastert pushed it through the House through pure muscle.\u201d When I asked how Cantor could do the same working with House Speaker John Boehner, Feehery continued: \u201cNot only does Cantor understand that the party must continue with its legacy as the champion of civil rights, this would take a huge argument away from the Democrats who say Republicans are trying to take away the black vote.\u201d Feehery is precisely right\u2014as we honor the 50-year celebration and legacy of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 along with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it is time for the Republican Party to demonstrate leadership to address legitimate concerns while presenting a bill to President Obama for his signature.\n\nDemocrats have certainly done their fair share of utilizing the race card in the Obama era to demonize their political opponents. Efforts to enact sensible reforms to promote the integrity of the ballot box such as the presentation of an identification card have been demonized as racist. While this is wrong and not true, Republicans have an obligation to lead on civil rights issues, as this has been our historical legacy.\n\nTo this end, I can think of no better way for Cantor to end his tenure as House Majority Leader than for him to forge a consensus of the majority to preserve and protect the Voting Rights Act so all Americans will continue to have unfettered access to the ballot box\u2014regardless of their skin color or ethnicity. I believe the outgoing majority leader from a Southern state could move the country forward by ensuring the House fulfills its obligation as the People\u2019s House to act responsibly to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:54.243+0000"}

{"entityId": 1998, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s new book offers key insights into the administration\u2019s hunt for Osama bin Laden and their distrust of Pakistan\u2019s role in hiding Target Number One.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s book Hard Choices has been dismissed by many as short on news. Yet on the most important foreign policy event of her tenure as Secretary of State, the killing of Osama bin Laden, Hard Choices actually offers important new insights into the administration\u2019s thinking about Pakistan\u2019s role in helping to hide high-value Target Number One for almost a decade.\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency found bin Laden hiding in a \u201cfortified compound\u201d in Abbottabad, Pakistan in late 2010. Abbottabad is a small city about one hour from Islamabad and home to Pakistan\u2019s premier military academy, the equivalent of West Point. Abbottabad was founded by the British in 1853 to house a military garrison, which it still does. It is a city closely monitored and watched by Pakistan\u2019s Inter Services Intelligence, or ISI, because it is home to much of the country\u2019s top brass. Clinton tells readers that at the first meeting of the National Security Council principals to review the CIA\u2019s new intelligence, the question was raised about whether the intelligence should be shared with Pakistan.\n\nClinton writes that \u201cI and others thought we could not trust Pakistan.\u201d She adds, \u201cI also knew elements in the Pakistani intelligence service, the ISI, maintained ties to the Taliban, al-Qaeda and other extremists.\u201d In her account, \u201cthe President immediately took that option off the table.\u201d When another participant in the secret deliberations argued that not telling the Pakistani army would humiliate its sense of honor, then-Secretary Clinton exploded and said, \u201cWhat about our national honor? What about going after the man who killed three thousand innocent people?\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s decision not to tell Pakistan was, of course, the right one to make\u2014but it was truly extraordinary in perspective. By 2011 the United States had provided over $25 billion in military and economic aid to Pakistan since 9/11 for precisely one purpose: to fight al Qaeda. Two Presidents, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, had provided 18 F16 jet fighters, eight P3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, 6,000 TOW anti-tank missiles, 500 AMRAM air-to-air missiles, six C-130 transport aircraft, 20 Cobra attack helicopters and a Perry class frigate to the Pakistani military to encourage them to fight al Qaeda. Yet at the moment of truth, the President and the Secretary of State decided they could not trust the ISI with information on the location of al Qaeda\u2019s leader.\n\nHard Choices also makes clear what has been implicit before. Secretary Clinton believed well before 2011 that elements of the Pakistani establishment were helping to hide bin Laden. In fact she said so in a meeting with Pakistani journalists and students in Islamabad in October 2009 when she found \u201cit hard to believe that nobody in the Pakistani government knows\u201d where bin Laden and other senior al Qaeda leaders were hiding. She asked, \u201cCouldn\u2019t they get them if they really wanted to?\u201d After putting the accusation on the table, Clinton writes, \u201cthe room was completely silent. I had just said what every American official believed to be true but never uttered out loud.\u201d White House press spokesman Robert Gibbs was asked if Clinton\u2019s comments were too blunt and inappropriate. He responded, \u201ccompletely appropriate.\u201d\n\nClinton makes clear in the book she did not believe the elected civilian government knew where bin Laden was hidden. In 2007 President Asif Ali Zardari\u2019s wife, Benazir Bhutto, was killed by an al Qaeda plot, possibly with the collusion of the ISI. The army keeps the civilians in the dark about its role in patronizing terror. Clinton also acknowledges that Pakistan faces its own terror threat and has lost thousands to terror attacks since 9/11. But the cause of this problem is precisely the army\u2019s \u201cties to the Taliban and other extremists that date back to the struggle against the Soviet Union in the 1980s.\u201d Pakistan has kept \u201cpoisonous snakes in its backyard and expected them to bite only its neighbors.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s account of her suspicions of Pakistani collusion in hiding bin Laden reinforce Bob Gates\u2019 more cryptic account in his book, Duty, where he writes that Pakistan \u201cwas really no ally at all\u201d in fighting al Qaeda. Gates says, \u201cIn every instance where we provided a heads-up to the Pakistani military or intelligence services, the target was forewarned and fled.\u201d\n\nPakistan\u2019s double-dealing continues today. After the deadly attack on Karachi airport early this month, Pakistan\u2019s army launched a military operation in Waziristan on the Afghan border to attack the Pakistan Taliban. Those U.S.-supplied F16s have been targeting the Pakistani Taliban and associated militants in an operation code named Zarb-e-Azb, after the prophet Muhammad\u2019s sword. But they are not targeting the hideouts and safe havens of the Haqqani network of the Afghanistan Taliban, which operates in the same neighborhood. The Haqqanis have been partners of the ISI since the late 1970s, first against the Russians and now against NATO forces in Afghanistan. The Haqqani network was hiding Bowe Berghdal in the borderlands with Afghanistan for three years. And the U.S. still provides military aid to Pakistan.\n\nThree years after the raid that brought justice to HVT1, there is still no smoking gun about what Pakistani intelligence knew about his hideout. Pakistan\u2019s own secret investigation of the issue, leaked to Al-Jazeera, makes clear it is likely the ISI knew about the hideout in Abbottabad and helped hide bin Laden, but it carefully refrains from saying so explicitly. That would be too dangerous.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:55.247+0000"}
{"entityId": 1999, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "With some House Republicans gunning for impeachment, their leadership is trying for a less ruinous way to punish the president\u2014a lawsuit that passed along party lines Wednesday.\n\nBy a vote of 225 to 201 almost entirely along party lines, the House of Representatives voted Wednesday to proceed with a lawsuit against Obama for \u201coverstepp[ing] his constitutional authority\u201d as president and failing to undertake his duties under Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution to \u201ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d Every Democrat present voted against the lawsuit, as did five Republicans. The lawsuit, which is likely to be thrown out of federal court on procedural grounds, focuses particularly on Obama\u2019s decision to delay the employer mandate in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe lawsuit comes as many conservatives have urged House Republicans to begin impeachment proceedings against Obama. Indeed, all five Republicans who voted against the lawsuit, including Paul Broun of Georgia and Steve Stockman of Texas, did so because they believe impeachment is more appropriate. While these calls have been limited mainly to marginal figures on the right such as former reality television star Sarah Palin, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise refused to rule it out in a television appearance Sunday.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner and many other leading members of the GOP, however, have opposed the possibility of impeachment, calling it a political misstep. The lawsuit is viewed as an alternative that would appease the GOP\u2019s base without alienating more moderate voters. In 1998, the failed Republican attempt to remove President Clinton from office redounded to the political benefit of Democrats. Impeachment proceedings likely would have the same effect this time, especially with the success that Democratic campaigns have had fundraising off of the specter of impeachment in recent weeks. And with 67 votes required in the Democratic-controlled Senate to convict Obama and remove him from office, successful impeachment proceedings may be impossible. (Even if Obama were somehow removed from office, conservatives probably wouldn\u2019t be thrilled at the prospect of a President Biden).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that the speaker is doing this\u2026it\u2019s a way to avoid [impeachment]. You sort out the differences between the executive and legislative through the judicial.\u201d\n\nRep. Steve King, an ardent conservative from Iowa, praised Wednesday\u2019s vote to The Daily Beast: \u201cIt\u2019s necessary because the president has clearly violated the Constitution\u2026you cannot have a president that makes up law.\u201d The five-term Republican added: \u201cI\u2019m glad that the speaker is doing this\u2026it\u2019s a way to avoid [impeachment]. You sort out the differences between the executive and legislative through the judicial.\u201d The lawsuit was the only alternative to beginning impeachment proceedings, he said.\n\nKing\u2019s criticism was echoed by fellow Tea Partier Kerry Bentivolio of Michigan, who said in a statement: \u201cAmericans do not elect kings with four-year terms; we elect presidents who have the duty of executing the laws passed by Congress as they are written.\u201d\n\nAfter the vote, Democrats attacked the legislation as a waste of Congress\u2019 time and taxpayer money. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said at a press conference: \u201cRepublicans are using the taxpayers\u2019 time and money to sue the president. We don\u2019t have money to have an early-childhood education for our children\u2026but we do have money to sue the president.\u201d Her criticism was echoed by Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who said Congress is \u201cwasting their time, wasting their money, and wasting a focus on jobs.\u201d\n\nOnce filed, the lawsuit be the House of Representatives\u2019 first in American history against a president.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T07:10:55.503+0000"}
